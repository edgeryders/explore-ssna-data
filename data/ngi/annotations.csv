28670,v1.0,,"For example the GDPR. A few years ago before it actually entered into force, I knew it would most likely be more challenging to be GDPR compliant for small organization than for the large ones. So, despite the declared goal being “we are going to rule how Google and Facebook access your data,” we already knew this was going to hinder small organization’s activities, and actually a treasure trove for the big ones. And what happened if we look at the reviews, two years later, three years later, that's exactly what happened.",/post/61024,2021-02-12T18:00:25.766Z,2021-02-12T18:00:25.766Z,61024,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,11075,854,424

You want to understand where information is leaked for the prediction to be faked, if the prediction itself cannot be explained.

It’s a simple demonstrator of how facial recognition will label you based on its training data set. Concretely, based on ImageNet, which according to this project is the dominant training model out there, used widely in the making of real world products. I highly encourage you to try it out, but with a warning: The results might be hilarious, or pretty disturbing.ImageNet Roulette is best enjoyed side by side with Excavating AI, which explains a little better what’s going on:

“Training sets, then, are the foundation on which contemporary machine-learning systems are built. They are central to how AI systems recognize and interpret the world. These datasets shape the epistemic boundaries governing how AI systems operate, and thus are an essential part of understanding socially significant questions about AI. But when we look at the training images widely used in computer-vision systems, we find a bedrock composed of shaky and skewed assumptions.”",/post/59880,2021-01-17T01:50:32.054Z,2021-01-17T01:50:32.054Z,59880,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,10863,5092,8062

27821,v1.0,,"what actually could be a useful use of tech? There have been a few interesting efforts of trying to create apps or automated system, for people to collect evidence pertaining to tech facilitated harassment in a way that that would be legally admissible. But for those the victim would still have to go through three years of chat history with their abuser. Instead, let’s figure out a method to automate that process. Not only is it a traumatizing experience, but also a lot of victims don’t have the data literacy to be able to doso.

Assume that we manage to develop an algorithm that actually does adhere to whatever broadly plausible mathematical fairness desiderata we have articulated in the design stage, and then we deploy it in the world. But, unsurprisingly, the world is shaped by a history of inequality and injustice, and technological models interact dynamically with the social world. So, whatever new data gets fed back into our algorithmic model will reflect those inequalities in our status quo to some extent.

27387,v1.0,,"I think that public discourse on this issue tends to split into two fairly extreme views, neither one of which is correct. On the one hand, there’s ‘AI optimism: the view that the increasingly ubiquitous use of AI is inevitable, that we can’t return to not using AI once we have deployed it in a given domain. The implicit assumption behind that view often seems to be something like, ""well, if AI is inevitable, there isn't really a point in trying to critique it ethically""—or to critique it politically, even. On this view, AI is nothing more than a tool—and one that promises to have a decidedly positive impact on society. On the other hand, there is a dramatically opposing view that says something like, “it is inevitable that all AI will lead to incredibly bad and harmful consequences”. That’s a different sense of inevitability right there. Tech pessimists seem to think that whatever we do, whichever domain we focus on in our AI deployment, the use of automated reasoning methods will always be somehow counterproductive or harmful.",/post/75832,2020-12-05T03:39:04.325Z,2020-12-05T03:39:04.325Z,75832,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,13438,5059,8012

Also, I think it’s important for practitioners to bear in mind that ethical reflection is never a process that is done unilaterally, and it’s never a process that is done, so to speak. We shouldn't approach AI ethics as something like a checklist. We should not think of ethics as a final ‘quality control’ check that we simply run once after we've developed a particular technology. We should have ethical goals in mind before we deploy, but we should also be very open to changing those ethical goals once we do deploy and once we see what effects that technology has in the world. Recall the problem of model-world interactions that I mentioned before: because of it, we might simply not foresee certain problems, we might not be able to accurately forecast the magnitude of problems, we might not be able to predict how different technological systems interact with each other, and we may not be able to accurately predict how humans change their behaviour once they know they are subject to algorithmic assessments. All of these problems require that we keep our ethical critique going, rather than approaching it as a static, one-time process.

Recall the problem of model-world interactions that I mentioned before: because of it, we might simply not foresee certain problems, we might not be able to accurately forecast the magnitude of problems, we might not be able to predict how different technological systems interact with each other, and we may not be able to accurately predict how humans change their behaviour once they know they are subject to algorithmic assessments.

27132,v1.0,,"I think that public discourse on this issue tends to split into two fairly extreme views, neither one of which is correct. On the one hand, there’s ‘AI optimism: the view that the increasingly ubiquitous use of AI is inevitable, that we can’t return to not using AI once we have deployed it in a given domain. The implicit assumption behind that view often seems to be something like, ""well, if AI is inevitable, there isn't really a point in trying to critique it ethically""—or to critique it politically, even. On this view, AI is nothing more than a tool—and one that promises to have a decidedly positive impact on society. On the other hand, there is a dramatically opposing view that says something like, “it is inevitable that all AI will lead to incredibly bad and harmful consequences”. That’s a different sense of inevitability right there. Tech pessimists seem to think that whatever we do, whichever domain we focus on in our AI deployment, the use of automated reasoning methods will always be somehow counterproductive or harmful.I think both views are wrong. The first view underestimates our ability to subject AI to productive scepticism, public oversight, and collective control. Even if it is inevitable that we will be using more and more AI in our collective decision-making processes, we ought to keep reflecting critically on AI’s purpose. There might be some collective decision-making problem domains where it would be ethically and politically inadequate to use AI because we intuitively feel that when things go wrong in those domains, we want a human decision-maker to blame; we want somebody to justify to us why a particular decision outcome was reached. In those domains, we are often quite happy to not be maximally efficient or accurate. What we really want is to think and argue with each other about how best to arrange our political and social life, about what it would mean to have a just society, about how we can relate to each other as true equals. These are ultimately not just ethical, but fundamentally political questions. Of course, tech optimists might reply to the response that I just gave: “but clearly AI will optimize our collective decision-making!” To that, I think a more nuanced and sceptical view might say in response, “well, optimising isn't everything”. We must exercise our critical judgment to determine when optimising further and further, and thereby entrenching and accelerating our current social status quo, is actually what matters most. And in many cases, that might not be what justice requires. But at the same time, the second view that I outlined before—the tech pessimists’ view—can also be misleading. It is misleading in the sense that it equates all forms of AI and machine-learning, including their ethical importance and impact, with each other. I do not think that that is plausible at all. Not all forms of AI will lead to the same kinds of harmful outcomes. It is especially important to ask: where and how can we use AI to mitigate injustice rather than exacerbating it? Nuanced ethical and political engagement with new technologies requires avoiding sweeping generalisations. But, it is clear that, as a general principle, if using algorithmic decision-making in a particular decision domain moves us further away from justice, then we have a strong presumption against using it in that domain.",/post/75832,2020-11-25T11:00:05.434Z,2020-11-25T11:00:05.434Z,75832,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,13438,5059,7313

What we really want is to think and argue with each other about how best to arrange our political and social life, about what it would mean to have a just society, about how we can relate to each other as true equals. These are ultimately not just ethical, but fundamentally political questions. Of course, tech optimists might reply to the response that I just gave: “but clearly AI will optimize our collective decision-making!” To that, I think a more nuanced and sceptical view might say in response, “well, optimising isn't everything”. We must exercise our critical judgment to determine when optimising further and further, and thereby entrenching and accelerating our current social status quo, is actually what matters most. And in many cases, that might not be what justice requires. But at the same time, the second view that I outlined before—the tech pessimists’ view—can also be misleading. It is misleading in the sense that it equates all forms of AI and machine-learning, including their ethical importance and impact, with each other. I do not think that that is plausible at all. Not all forms of AI will lead to the same kinds of harmful outcomes. It is especially important to ask: where and how can we use AI to mitigate injustice rather than exacerbating it? Nuanced ethical and political engagement with new technologies requires avoiding sweeping generalisations. But, it is clear that, as a general principle, if using algorithmic decision-making in a particular decision domain moves us further away from justice, then we have a strong presumption against using it in that domain.",/post/75832,2020-11-25T11:00:05.356Z,2020-11-25T11:00:05.356Z,75832,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,13438,5059,7591

The concern about automated decision with discriminatory effect misses the point that a border system is already a very racialized and very discriminatory system. With regards to social welfare, especially unemployment systems are most likely to impact people with low economic resources, and a good portion of that is likely going to be immigrants. People quickly made the conclusions that border control could be discriminatory or make mistakes. Similar to the Austrian example, there are claims that if you are an immigrant, or a woman with a child, the systems reduces your chances of getting access to resources to re-enter the employment market.Here we see the trouble with the systems, because they are already racialized and discriminatory systems of population control. That they’re discriminatory is not just at the level of the algorithm, but the whole system. The fact that it’s optimizing over that population is already very problematic, because it’s going to optimize with respect to somebody’s understanding of what is optimal. The discriminatory effect is just an additional factor, but it’s not the main factor.

27025,v1.0,,"Burning Question
The push for AI is basically marketing for a financial boost for creating a computational infrastructure based on optimization systems that govern all aspects of life. Do we want this infrastructure? How can we resist it, engage it, and ensure it serves people and their environment, and not the other way around?

It optimizes all of its services, so that the users are happy and if the user base grows, it has more location data from people, which can then be used to build new services and overall, keep investors happy.In services like Waze, the app is the product of layers and layers of managerial and mathematical forms of optimization.

This box was the product of a very specific way to produce software as a product using “waterfall methodologies”. In waterfall methods, you start with the requirements from the clients, once you have those, you go to your developer team and start turning those requirements into a specification and a design of a machine to be developed. This whole process was slow, like one or two years, and after that you would emerge and pass what you developed back to the client. You would test it with the client to see if it worked. And, ideally it all worked and you were done.Or, for example with Microsoft, every two to three years a new release of the operating system would be offered. They would go through a similar cycle for each version, and come back in 2-3 years with a new version of the operating system, or other software like Microsoft Office. Once it was ready, you would release the code and put it on a disk to get sold. Once code was released, changes were difficult, so that release date was a big moment and the end of a production cycle. Today, we do not buy boxes, but open up a browser window to access most software. We access Facebook, Google search or Google Docs, and a host of other “services” instead of installing them on our computers. With services the code is on a server. The user connects to the server to get the functionality.

And, ideally it all worked and you were done.Or, for example with Microsoft, every two to three years a new release of the operating system would be offered. They would go through a similar cycle for each version, and come back in 2-3 years with a new version of the operating system, or other software like Microsoft Office. Once it was ready, you would release the code and put it on a disk to get sold. Once code was released, changes were difficult, so that release date was a big moment and the end of a production cycle. Today, we do not buy boxes, but open up a browser window to access most software. We access Facebook, Google search or Google Docs, and a host of other “services” instead of installing them on our computers. With services the code is on a server. The user connects to the server to get the functionality. This is what happens with a web browser.This subtle shift has completely changed how software is produced and how the software industry functions. As a result, the political economy of these companies has transformed, turning them into very different kinds of investment objects.",/post/64014,2020-11-24T14:12:27.903Z,2020-11-24T14:12:27.903Z,64014,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,11514,5657,7949

""The term “self-learning” is confusing and misleading: an algorithm does not know and understand reality. There are predictive algorithms which are fairly accurate in predicting the outcome of a court case. However, they do not do so on the basis of the substantive merits of the case.

The second request concerns the practice of dismissing drivers automatically for suspicion of fraud.

But there was a glitch: the secretaries would cooperate instead of choosing for themselves. So, Nash simply dismissed them, calling them unfit subjects of the game. It was the same game, the Prisoner’s Dilemma that was later used to rationalize that it would be better if the US would strike first.The story around Prisoner’s Dilemma is good example of how the model makes assumptions about humans being selfish and always after maximum gain, an assumption that percolates through economics, social choice theory etc.",/post/64014,2020-11-09T12:10:14.261Z,2020-11-09T12:10:14.261Z,64014,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,11514,5657,7280

People believe numbers are neutral, or that mathematical concepts or abstractions don’t have political relevance.

The numbers may make it seem as if things expressed in formal languages are neutral, but in fact — we see again and again — that this is not the case.",/post/64014,2020-11-09T12:07:06.814Z,2020-11-09T12:07:06.814Z,64014,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,11514,5657,7894

He bolstered his argument using mathematics, specifically, game theory, in order to rationalize and deem “objective” a very devastating political position.

26557,v1.0,,"I think Wikipedia is a rather interesting example - and not necessarily a purely positive one. But first - those 40 million is the number of total accounts. Actually actively editing users are more around 126.000, so significantly less. (And actually on par with Mastodon or Diaspora).Now, why is Wikipedia an interesting example? For one because of the discrepancy of who edits and who consumes it. There are over 800 million different devices accessing it each month, but only126k editing and maintaining it. Active Editors are actually about 40.000 only.Now, why is it that only a fraction of a percent are actually maintaining it?I suspect several reasons:
* editing is hard and unrewarding
* the existing community makes it hard for new people to join, putting up layers of bureaucracy (this is especially true for the German Wikipedia, but I've talked to a Wikipedian from Hong Kong and they confirmed the same issue)
* Generally there is a discrepancy between consuming and maintainingThe other interesting thing is that Wikipedia has, as you pointed out, effectively killed traditional encyclopedias. And I am not too sure how much of a good thing this is. It does self-govern itself quite effectively in that it is stable. But it is also frighteningly good at resisting any kind of change. Which is good if you see it as ""protecting against outside influence"", but very bad if viewed as ""maintaining the status quo of those in power"".But regardless of that - I do not think that Wikipedia is a fitting example of ""this is large and still working"", because in terms of people actively working on it, it is not particularly large.

26407,v1.0,,"""Consumers routinely supply personal data to technology companies in exchange for services. Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply — “return on data” (ROD) — remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions. Pivoting from the privacy paradigm to ROD will both incentivize data-driven service providers to offer consumers higher ROD, as well as create opportunities for new market entrants.""",/post/55206,2020-10-27T10:25:54.676Z,2020-10-27T10:25:54.676Z,55206,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,9821,4892,7762

26081,v1.0,,"Probably not that related, since it deals with airwaves, but one thing that comes to mind first off for me since I was in the radio business for some years, is how, in large-scale emergency situations such as hurricane Sandy in 2012 when the whole mobile phone grid crashed in the northeast United States and much of the electric grid went down.  Then, one had to turn on a radio to find out what was going on.  It was a fallback because radio transmitters all have backup generators, and you can get a radio signal with a battery operated unit or even one that is hand-cranked.  (This is the main reason why the federal government funds public radio.)

26080,v1.0,,"yes you could see the consequences of not having effectively organised centralised /gov that can respond to this during the 2004 Tsunami crisis] in which Swedes suffered some of the the worst casualties. The Swedish government took a full four days to respond, finally sending planes outfitted with doctors and medical supplies to care for injured citizens. This screw up was a trauma on the citizenry at large because we are a small country - everyone knows/knew someone who had been there. There were Italian emergency personnel on the ground within 72hrs if memory doesn't fail me. @alberto can tell you about the Italian setup but in Stockholm we watched with incredulity as different ministers bounced around the responsibility for making decisions about how to respond. Sweden at the time did not have a central authority with responsibility for coordination of disaster management, or a clear chain of command for making those decisions. I would have thought it would have fallen under defence but  @lakomaa knows more about the institutional architectures than I do.

26077,v1.0,,"What we have here in California are huge fires.  The lack of fallback/resilience measures here are causing people to rethink much of their core lives.Also, tsunamis.  We have a siren warning system on this north coast of California, and it did go off back when the earthquake hit that destroyed Fukushima.  But a tsunami often is not like a movie portrays it.  Rather, it is like a fast and very high tidal surge.  It came into the harbor in a nearby town here and rather quietly lifted a bunch of fishing and cruising boats off of their pier moorings and set them adrift.  Just tore the ropes right off the docks.  And it came later than the sirens suggested, so for a long time it looked like the sirens gave a false alarm. People went back to their activities and then, whoops, this pier is getting lifted.  The only fallback for something like that was to get the hell out of there and stay out for longer than you thought you should.I know this is some digression from the main thrust of Peter's inquiry.  But when I think of a lot of Smart City stuff, I think of cameras all over the place.  When they break down, I will probably hope there isn't a fallback mechanism.  Unless there is some greater public good to all those cameras.  In London, it's security.  But do they really deter?  I'm sure the argument is that they do deter. They didn't stop the subway getting blown up in the previous decade. But now there are exponentially more cameras in London.  Do they prevent crime?

26033,v1.0,,"Probably not that related, since it deals with airwaves, but one thing that comes to mind first off for me since I was in the radio business for some years, is how, in large-scale emergency situations such as hurricane Sandy in 2012 when the whole mobile phone grid crashed in the northeast United States and much of the electric grid went down.  Then, one had to turn on a radio to find out what was going on.  It was a fallback because radio transmitters all have backup generators, and you can get a radio signal with a battery operated unit or even one that is hand-cranked.  (This is the main reason why the federal government funds public radio.)

26032,v1.0,,"Urgh, yeah I have experienced first hand how quickly basic infrastructures e.g food delivery break down when you have war eg. In the end what makes cities resilient is if people are good are organising, you have emergency response mechanisms in place in government institutions that have money and training (e.g defence)   and you have people with deep skills/knowledge to come up with creative solutions using tech that is self-standing i.e not dependent on complex tech and economic infrastructure.

26031,v1.0,,"yes you could see the consequences of not having effectively organised centralised /gov that can respond to this during the 2004 Tsunami crisis] in which Swedes suffered some of the the worst casualties. The Swedish government took a full four days to respond, finally sending planes outfitted with doctors and medical supplies to care for injured citizens. This screw up was a trauma on the citizenry at large because we are a small country - everyone knows/knew someone who had been there. There were Italian emergency personnel on the ground within 72hrs if memory doesn't fail me. @alberto can tell you about the Italian setup but in Stockholm we watched with incredulity as different ministers bounced around the responsibility for making decisions about how to respond. Sweden at the time did not have a central authority with responsibility for coordination of disaster management, or a clear chain of command for making those decisions. I would have thought it would have fallen under defence but  @lakomaa knows more about the institutional architectures than I do.

26017,v1.0,,"yes you could see the consequences of not having effectively organised centralised /gov that can respond to this during the 2004 Tsunami crisis] in which Swedes suffered some of the the worst casualties. The Swedish government took a full four days to respond, finally sending planes outfitted with doctors and medical supplies to care for injured citizens. This screw up was a trauma on the citizenry at large because we are a small country - everyone knows/knew someone who had been there. There were Italian emergency personnel on the ground within 72hrs if memory doesn't fail me. @alberto can tell you about the Italian setup but in Stockholm we watched with incredulity as different ministers bounced around the responsibility for making decisions about how to respond. Sweden at the time did not have a central authority with responsibility for coordination of disaster management, or a clear chain of command for making those decisions. I would have thought it would have fallen under defence but  @lakomaa knows more about the institutional architectures than I do.

26016,v1.0,,"yes you could see the consequences of not having effectively organised centralised /gov that can respond to this during the 2004 Tsunami crisis] in which Swedes suffered some of the the worst casualties. The Swedish government took a full four days to respond, finally sending planes outfitted with doctors and medical supplies to care for injured citizens. This screw up was a trauma on the citizenry at large because we are a small country - everyone knows/knew someone who had been there. There were Italian emergency personnel on the ground within 72hrs if memory doesn't fail me. @alberto can tell you about the Italian setup but in Stockholm we watched with incredulity as different ministers bounced around the responsibility for making decisions about how to respond. Sweden at the time did not have a central authority with responsibility for coordination of disaster management, or a clear chain of command for making those decisions. I would have thought it would have fallen under defence but  @lakomaa knows more about the institutional architectures than I do.

I would have thought it would have fallen under defence but  @lakomaa knows more about the institutional architectures than I do.

26001,v1.0,,"Probably not that related, since it deals with airwaves, but one thing that comes to mind first off for me since I was in the radio business for some years, is how, in large-scale emergency situations such as hurricane Sandy in 2012 when the whole mobile phone grid crashed in the northeast United States and much of the electric grid went down.  Then, one had to turn on a radio to find out what was going on.  It was a fallback because radio transmitters all have backup generators, and you can get a radio signal with a battery operated unit or even one that is hand-cranked.  (This is the main reason why the federal government funds public radio.)

25997,v1.0,,"Probably not that related, since it deals with airwaves, but one thing that comes to mind first off for me since I was in the radio business for some years, is how, in large-scale emergency situations such as hurricane Sandy in 2012 when the whole mobile phone grid crashed in the northeast United States and much of the electric grid went down.  Then, one had to turn on a radio to find out what was going on.  It was a fallback because radio transmitters all have backup generators, and you can get a radio signal with a battery operated unit or even one that is hand-cranked.  (This is the main reason why the federal government funds public radio.)

25984,v1.0,,"Probably not that related, since it deals with airwaves, but one thing that comes to mind first off for me since I was in the radio business for some years, is how, in large-scale emergency situations such as hurricane Sandy in 2012 when the whole mobile phone grid crashed in the northeast United States and much of the electric grid went down.  Then, one had to turn on a radio to find out what was going on.  It was a fallback because radio transmitters all have backup generators, and you can get a radio signal with a battery operated unit or even one that is hand-cranked.  (This is the main reason why the federal government funds public radio.)

25900,v1.0,,"@fjanss, your assumptions about what we are creating are incorrect. We are NOT building a centralized platform. While it is true that we have not built in the DLT aspect of our system yet, we will launch with a DLT in place. (We are 10 months out from the planned launch and plan to remain fluid as to the specific implementation until Q2.) Also, we will have open source aspects to our project. We will not open source aspects of the system that could enable one of the Internet Platforms to put us out of business before we get started.

23881,v1.0,,"""Consumers routinely supply personal data to technology companies in exchange for services. Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply — “return on data” (ROD) — remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions. Pivoting from the privacy paradigm to ROD will both incentivize data-driven service providers to offer consumers higher ROD, as well as create opportunities for new market entrants.""

Can we not come up with something more creative to make money but to shove products into our faces we don't really need?

23427,v1.0,,"""Consumers routinely supply personal data to technology companies in exchange for services. Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply — “return on data” (ROD) — remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions. Pivoting from the privacy paradigm to ROD will both incentivize data-driven service providers to offer consumers higher ROD, as well as create opportunities for new market entrants.""

23426,v1.0,,"Just as a note - I ran a large web site/forum for 18 years and then another mid-sized for five and I never used any visitor data for anything....although I must admit to having shown some adsense ads on the larger site. Truth is, they never paid very well.
I happened to find the ad model worked for me - due to lower overhead (just me, part time) and also due to ""direct to client"" ads. Since there was no such thing as an ad network at the time, I contacted manufacturers of said products (high efficiency wood/pellet stoves, etc.) and had them pay yearly fees from $800 to 10K+ for being featured on the site. I never packed any pages with ads so received zero complaints over two decades. The site was profitable (although I never started or ran it for money!) from the first year until I sold it.",/post/55221,2020-09-03T10:30:10.679Z,2020-09-03T10:30:10.679Z,55221,3323,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,9821,5188,7339
23425,v1.0,,"I am no legal scholar, but this may be because data protection is assimilated to privacy, a human right. Human rights doctrine ringfences away from market logic  some aspects of human life. For example, there is certainly a return on child labor (ROCB) – just ask 19th century mine owners. There is also a return on selling yourself away as a slave (ROSYAAS) – and indeed this move was the last recourse of debt-ridden farmer in many societies, including ancient Babylonia. But modern lawmakers conclude that such practices are degrading and should be outlawed, not monetized. Maybe the regulators mentioned in the paper have a similar mindset about consumer privacy (I prefer to talk of ""individual"" privacy).

23411,v1.0,,"I am no legal scholar, but this may be because data protection is assimilated to privacy, a human right. Human rights doctrine ringfences away from market logic  some aspects of human life. For example, there is certainly a return on child labor (ROCB) – just ask 19th century mine owners. There is also a return on selling yourself away as a slave (ROSYAAS) – and indeed this move was the last recourse of debt-ridden farmer in many societies, including ancient Babylonia. But modern lawmakers conclude that such practices are degrading and should be outlawed, not monetized.

They built this system by themselves, and it's open-sourced.  The cheapest membership is a one-month membership deal. The software helps them to target the right readers: analytics tell them that someone reading it on an iphone is 5 times more likely to buy a 3 month  membership deal than someone on android - so they show a different deal to those than to android users. How it works: their long form reads are behind a paywall, but not fully. Readers can read several paragraphs, more than with others, before they hit the paywall. All members can get a shareable link and share the articles they want on social, giving their friends a one-time free pass to read the full story.

They are a good start and it helped to validate that people are willing to pay for quality content. What makes the subscription model good is that it frees content providers from the necessity of optimising for clicks, but may be able to focus on producing quality content again. 
However they effectively create a 2 tier consumer society where some people just won't have access to this information. In my view it working somewhat against the purpose of journalism: to inform people. 
From a user perspective they are also horrible. Most readers are not reading content from just one provider, so buying a subscription from every of their sources is a decision making overkill and frankly too time consuming. Paid news aggregators only ease that problem, they don't solve it. What about all those little websites that are not big household names like the nytimes?

22489,v1.0,,"ntil the end of the 90s, it was very typical that software came in a box, which included floppy disks or CD ROMs that contained a copy of the software that you could install on your personal computer. This box was the product of a very specific way to produce software as a product using “waterfall methodologies”. In waterfall methods, you start with the requirements from the clients, once you have those, you go to your developer team and start turning those requirements into a specification and a design of a machine to be developed. This whole process was slow, like one or two years, and after that you would emerge and pass what you developed back to the client. You would test it with the client to see if it worked. And, ideally it all worked and you were done.Or, for example with Microsoft, every two to three years a new release of the operating system would be offered. They would go through a similar cycle for each version, and come back in 2-3 years with a new version of the operating system, or other software like Microsoft Office. Once it was ready, you would release the code and put it on a disk to get sold. Once code was released, changes were difficult, so that release date was a big moment and the end of a production cycle.

I am interested in the coliving coworking idea, as we still have more scope for renovation which includes all of the old dormatory rooms and kitchen in the building, and as we are situated at the foot of the Slieve Bloom mountain range and in the centre of Ireland we are at an ideal location for remote workers to work, and travel around the country.",/post/80475,2020-07-27T10:41:29.513Z,2020-07-27T10:41:29.513Z,80475,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,14066,6540,6168

21321,v1.0,,"I work in local government, in previous roles I would have worked with local Enterprise Centres that were specifically developed to support small business entrepreneurship and development. Most recently I am working on a government programme that will see over 300 small community based locations for the public to get access to the internet. Many of these will seek to develop co-working spaces for their local communities to avoid having to commute. I’m helping with up to 12 locations in my municipality. I have also been asked to help look at other community hub developments that do not have the same government backing, but will experience many of the same problems with generating demand, usage as well as the challenges facing the volunteers managing these facilities. My job is to help them to be successful.
How has the Covid19 crisis impacted your work processes?
There has been a step increase in demand/interest in remote working and coworking that can facilitate the balance between working outside the main business premises but can provide the social interaction that humans require.
Where do you see the potential for technologies to improve co-working?
technology is critical- from the tools to enable coworking to take place with people working for a variety of employers or for themselves through to the security, booking, location management of people using the co working spaces. For COVID19 control we need to be able to have accurate records of who is using co-working spaces to enable tracking and tracing of the virus to be carried out.
What do you think will/have to be the key changes/future developments in the co-working sector in future?
There will be increased interest however individual experiences will determine how successful it is both for the individual and for employers. Security for example is still an area that will require further work- challenges such as Data Security, security of the premises and property within it, personal security for those using such facilities (Cyber and personal). Much of my current focus is trying to establish if there is any successful examples of where this community based co-working model has worked and how can that be transcribed to what is happening in my Municipality.",/post/80422,2020-07-27T10:27:07.576Z,2020-07-27T10:27:07.576Z,80422,5479,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,14066,6530,6168

Yes, we are all in such a strange situation and I am concerned that we don't lose sight of the potential impact this can have on our students and teachers. Many have found themselves in places and situations in which they never expected to be at this time in their career (eg having to go back home to live with families, shared resources etc). This affects some more than others and we must not assume that carrying on studying and teaching is possible in all circumstances. Most Higher Education institutions in the UK have responded by introducing exceptional regulations for assessment and the subsequent progression and degree classification results which arise from this.

I have always strongly felt that space shapes the way we can think and feel (it's partially what my dissertation is on) so it's hard to be stuck in the same place. It means we have to find imaginative ways of being elsewhere, changing the scene!

Yes, we are all in such a strange situation and I am concerned that we don't lose sight of the potential impact this can have on our students and teachers. Many have found themselves in places and situations in which they never expected to be at this time in their career (eg having to go back home to live with families, shared resources etc). This affects some more than others and we must not assume that carrying on studying and teaching is possible in all circumstances. Most Higher Education institutions in the UK have responded by introducing exceptional regulations for assessment and the subsequent progression and degree classification results which arise from this.

So much of learning is in the in-between, when formal lectures aren't happening. That stuff is hard to replicate online. And it's interesting that you bring up mental health, @noemi, because I think what we found more than anything in Open Care is that having a strong sense of community massively helps with mental health issues. I just read the book Happy City, and the author finds the same thing --- ambient community feeling keeps us happy -- the people we chat to when we go get our morning coffee and all the people we recognise as we go about our daily lives. These points of contact are really important for the students as well -- it's not the formal learning that they're missing the most, it's all the ambient touchpoints that they no longer have.

Yes, we are all in such a strange situation and I am concerned that we don't lose sight of the potential impact this can have on our students and teachers. Many have found themselves in places and situations in which they never expected to be at this time in their career (eg having to go back home to live with families, shared resources etc).

They give us view into what projects are working on which is essential if we want to collaborate, coordinate, and reduce duplication of effort. The ""project map"" helps us find aligned projects, but they may not provide sufficient still requires us a ""cold"" call or  email to the people involved, which may or may not be on the map. To make project maps most useful, the profile could include things like the specifics of what is being worked on (background, methods, hypothesis), what is needed, what is offered, and how they would like to collaborate with other projects or how to get involved. 
3. Maps that connect concepts (offline) - these are commonly called mind maps. A  mind map  is a diagram used to visually organize information and can be siloed to the individual or worked on in a group. These types of maps are helpful for understanding concepts and ideas.

1. Identify a topic for the event based upon the ethnographic analysis done so far. Ask: what topics are the community most interested in? Which would be most useful/generative to do a deep dive into? 
2. Have at least a month to plan the call, invite a diverse range of participants (including the most active community members on platform on this topic),  and put informed consent procedures in place. 
3. Use the SSNA/codes/ethnography to pull out questions to ask participants during the call. (Research team can be present and ask questions as well as moderators). 
4. Record the call and transcribe the recording.
5. Post the transcription and code the transcription. 
6. Generate an SSNA based upon it (we need to brainstorm ways to have the Social part of the SSNA visualised in this, but at worst it’s a visualisation of the main themes of the conversation. At best, we separate each contribution into a different comment to see what concepts most frequently co-occur together).",/post/74525,2020-04-28T08:18:24.095Z,2020-04-28T08:18:24.095Z,74525,4934,AnnotatorStore::TextAnnotation,,pixel,,,,,,,13248,3323,5132

13329,v1.0,,"Breathing Games (www.breathinggames.net) promotes respiratory health by encouraging each citizen to take care of their health. We create educational and therapeutic games, devices to measure the breathe, and distributed data systems to inform public health practices, and policies.

We create a commons – collectively managed resources that are freely accessible and can be used and enriched by everyone – by spurring collaboration between people affected, caregivers, and passionate professionals to build on the collective intelligence.

The games produced participatorily are meant to improve the quality and life expectancy of people with respiratory problems – by educating, transforming therapy into games, and promoting healthy habits. They can be reused and adapted by everyone to address local problems and needs, as long as the free/libre and open-source licences are maintained. We also develop open-source hardware such as flowmeter for domesic use. This material shall enable everyone, in all countries, to get indicators about his health (lung capacity tests), and shall also provide decentralized, anonimyzed data to advance public health research (blockchain/IPFS).

On top of that we have been building a community of people to further develop and distribute the games. We successfully organized gamejams about cystic fibrosis and asthma in Switzerland and in Canada, and plan other events on breathing health and chronic respiratory diseases in the next months. The audience is huge: 1 out of 5 people in the world suffer from chronic respiratory diseases, and half of them do not follow the therapy as agreed with their caregiver.

Key to the success of this initiative is the socio-economic, non-exclusive model we developed, as well as the platform we use to log contributions and make the collective effort visible. We use agile development methodologies and allow members to self-organise, so that we build on the collective intelligence and transform ideas into sustainable, scalable products and services.

The participatory, inclusive approach enables us to build research-backed games that also are attractive and fun to play with. Interdisciplinarity helps us gain a multifaceted, holistic vision of healthcare and fosters collaboration between different parties, beyond institutions and countries.

It was in fact not the best move as the exercice takes about 30 minutes daily, which would require a lot of resources to have interesting games, plus the fact that the exercice is quite strict, so challenging to make it interesting. We then thought about other, more free gameplays, which we have to develop. We are now working on mini-games for asthma, that are about triggers and how to take the medicine. We want to reuse the work done for CF to build short games for aerosoltherapy.
