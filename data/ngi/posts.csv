I'm involved with a company that is trying to do just that. Dataswift (dataswift.io) Has developed a technology (the core technology was funded by the UK government and is open source) where individuals can hold their personal data on micro servers. These micro servers are linked up in an exchange, to enable ethical exchange of data. 

I'm Involved because of the governance aspects. The founders recognised that fair, transparent and impartial governance would be vital to the long-term success of the project. They set up An auanon3386180186omous not-for-profit company, a foundation, that is responsible for the governance (and holds a golden share in Dataswift). 

What would such governance look like? Who might be involved?  How would you balance all the various interests to ensure the biggest benefit to the widest number of people?

This is such a big question that the board of the foundation (of which I am a member) is thinking of creating a type of open source project to explore it.

Yes, this idea of data wallets (what you call microservers) has been sloshing around for a while – I first heard about it  in 2009. Governance is tricky, because one of the key interests (data holders) is so fragmented. By this I mean not only that there are many data holders, but that our individual contribution to the data economy is small, order of magnitude of, what? ~ 100 EUR per person per year? I would barely sign up for a scheme that returned to me ~20 EUR per year as a fair reward for contributing my data (OK, I would totally sign up, but for political reasons, and I am a data geek). I would definitely want to invest zero time in making it more share so that I can get 21 EUR instead (if internal democracy is super effective). 

To give you an idea, I am a member of the Italian main collecting society for music copyright monies. I have been for 30 years, and never once I voted in the elections for the board. Everybody in the board represents large copyright holders. I make maybe 4-5,000 EUR a year from that direction, so I would vote if I saw a decent alternative, but the big boys have an iron grip on he whole affair, so that's that.

I would like to check if Edgeryders would like to partner to solve some supply chain challenges in the food sector.

The challenge is that there are different 'tech' systems that don't necessarily 'talk' to each other as they use their own vocabularies.  This causes that food is actually locked in physical places where it is not needed letting other places in EU without food.

I am part of a consortium working on the 'Data Integration Challenge' of these systems.  Some partners are OGC (https://www.ogc.org/), ILVO (https://www.ilvo.vlaanderen.be/), F2FMarket (https://www.f2fmarket.tech/), EDDA (https://europeandigital.org/).

Since NGI initiatives have done anon2298377336 some research in the area of mapping semantic systems, and other related topics, it is recommended to have a NGI partner to support initiatives that are already running.

We would like to apply for several grants, having the NGI Atlantic as a first target for some experimentation, and going for bigger grants as the idea is big.

I would like to have a call with someone in the NGI project to talk about this opportunity for partnership.  We will be focusing on covid vocabulary around food.

Concretely I need: 
1. Check if Edgeryders wants to partner on this.
2. If yes, get general description on the methods already used to integrate them in the proposal.
3. Give access to our working document.
4. Agree on budget for the experimentation on NGI Atlantic.  Total is 150k for 6 months.  Doable with 30k?
5. Look for bigger grants.

**What is the Corona-Warn App?**
As Germany’s lockdowns and restriction measures quickly ease amidst the slowing spread of the novel corona virus, the government has been hard pressed to balance a careful reopening with measures to ensure the containment of the virus. On Tuesday, the German government introduced the [Corona Warn App](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/corona-warn-app), designed to identify and quickly “break chains of infection” (Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute). The App, which is being marketed as a voluntary download, alerts users when and for anon1138917760 long they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus. 


In a recent EdgeRyder Community Call, we talked to experts across Europe about the risks that contact tracing Apps pose for data security. Many agreed that these Apps and similar technologies force an unnecessary trade-off in which civil liberties may be sacrificed in the interest of fighting the virus. Experts warned of three major risks: a) we don’t have a clear privacy-friendly solution for the development of these technologies and it is therefore unclear where the data will be sourced from (and by whom) and anon1138917760 it will be regulated, b) there is an unequal distribution of risk as this may lead to the disproportionate targeting of vulnerable communities, and c) there is an absence of the counterfactual, meaning we don’t yet know enough about the effectiveness of allowing ‘normal life’ to resume and it is therefore risky to develop strategies without clear, counterfactual knowledge to work with. More on our discussions [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183), [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ethnography-team-reflection-on-a-surveillance-pandemic/13248/4) and [here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-reflection-of-the-methods-of-the-community-listening-post-9th-april-2020/13207).

 
In light of these discussions, I was curious to learn more about Germany’s App. I am from and currently live in Berlin, where many restrictions have already been lifted and where the summer months have brought more and more people out to public parks, restaurants and bars. 


**How can Germany feasibly guarantee users’ data privacy, hem further surveillance and effectively contain the spread of the virus?** 

 
The App – developed by the German government in collaboration with Apple, Google (using their “privacy-focused” technology) and Deutsche Telekom AG (Germany’s largest telecommunication company) – has received anon2298377336 a lot of praise for its seemingly data-friendly solution (even Chaos Computer Club (CCC) has not issued any critiques thus far):

 

Users have been assured that their data privacy will not be compromised and that contact data will not be saved centrally (though this was the original plan), but will instead be stored on the smartphones themselves. According to its developers, the App also does not log users’ location, but uses Bluetooth to allow users to share information. Users are also guaranteed anonymity while using the app, whereby each device is allocated an identification number, which is then visible to all other app users when in the same vicinity. During a span of two weeks, all user IDs are stored in your app, and, if one of those users tests positive during that two week span, your App alerts you. After two weeks, the data is erased. 

 
It seems that the effectiveness of this App is largely based upon the people using it. According to virologists at the [University of Oxford](https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Article/2020-04-16-digital-contact-tracing-can-slow-or-even-stop-coronavirus-transmission-and-ease-us-out-of-lockdown), such Apps are only effective if around 60% of the population uses them. In the German case, the effectiveness of the App also depends on users uploading their test results to the app: if a person tests positive for the virus, they receive a unique QR code which they then have to scan into their smartphone/the App. Only then can other users, who have been in contact with that person, be notified. Users are notified anonymously, meaning they don’t find out who the infected individual is, but they are informed about their personal risk level of infection and are urged to seek testing.  

 

The App – which cost 20m Euro to develop and will require 3m Euro a month to operate – has an open source program code, meaning it can theoretically be copied and updated by other countries. The German government hopes that other European countries will follow suit and that a system will quickly be built that works across Europe.  

  

Within the first day of its launch, the App was downloaded close to 1m times, anon1138917760ever many remain sceptical about what this means for their data privacy and anon1138917760 these technologies might feed in to further surveillance. According to a recent poll, around 42% of those surveyed, feel comfortable using the App, as opposed to 39% who said they wouldn’t and 19% who either did not own a smart phone or felt they needed more information. 

 

I talked to a handful of family members and friends about their views of the App (most around the age of 30). Their reactions split across two main groups: Most (group 1) felt that they did not have enough information about the App, its aims and functions and its implications for data security, and are sceptical of downloading it. Many said, they will ‘wait and see’ anon1138917760 useful and secure the App is before they consider downloading it. The second, much smaller group was optimistic about the App; several had already downloaded it, others were strongly considering it. Many in this group cited their trust in the government and that, since the data is not stored centrally, they felt comfortable using it. This group also believes the App is the best way to contain the spread of the virus.  

 

This is just a cursory glance at the recent developments in Germany’s contact-tracing App technology, but I am curious to hear from the rest of the EdgeRyders community. What are your thoughts?"

Well, here my (= 65y, STEM education, first contact with IT was when we used TTYs and punch cards) short comment:

(1) I dislike the App because I do not run around with an open Bluetooth connection and location services switched on .
(2) I downloaded the App and noticed that it is easy to switch it on/off.
(3) I plan to use the App in circumstances when I have to trade off 'close distance to many unknown persons' against '(1)'
(4) Condition '(3)' will be met seldom considering my current place of living & style of life.

Hence, the App is like my bicycle helmet. It is to use when meaningful - neither in bed nor at a dinner table; may be in public transport.

Yes, that is also my impression of the more IT-literate folks. Italy has its own version, called Immuni. It uses the same Bluetooth-based Google-Apple approach and protocol as the German one. After some complaints, the developer released [the source code](https://github.com/immuni-app/immuni-app-android). Reputable bloggers like Salvatore Aranzulla have given [a cautious thumbs-up](https://www.aranzulla.it/come-funziona-lapp-immuni-1215043.html). 

So why are people like, er, me, still dragging our feet? In my case, it's because of the Manning-Snowden revelation. Everything looks good on the surface, but we now know there is a depth of backdoors, shadowy deals and gigadatabases watched over by three-letter agencies (and their private sector partners). 

In other words: I cannot fully trust Immuni because I cannot fully trust *anything*. That makes me feel a mild irritation, an itch that I cannot scratch. There is really no way out. No hiding from Sauron's Eye. So, I might as well download the app... but my motivation is low, I would be serving even more data on a silver platter (and willingly, ticking the ""I accept the T&C"" box) to a system I cannot believe in. I will still do it... but I need to see a large and immediate gain. Which is now – as per our conversation – not clear is there."

Technically, the solution adopted is centralized, unlike in Germany and Italy, with [Sciensano](https://sciensano.be), the public health institute, acting as the center. Legally, we appear to be on very shaky grounds. Because: 

* The agency authorized to push the data onto the central repository, the Information Security Committee, is in a legal gray zone: it was instituted by Parliament in 2018, against the advice of the European Commission and the Belgian Council of State. This advice argued that the ISC is not GDPR-compliant. A recent inquiry by the magazine Wilfried also claims that parliament's procedures, and the constitution itself, were violated in instituting it. 
* Frank Robben, a high-achiever computer scientist and civil servant, is accused of standing at the intersection of multiple conflicts of interest around health data. He (by request of the government) is the material author of the bill framing Belgium's COVID app, as well as the creator of of the ISC itself. Additionally, he occupies [a position in the Belgian Data Protection Authority](https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/composition), and this is allegedly illegal, because appointees to the DPA are not supposed to occupy public office.   

Notice anon1138917760 this lack of trust – both the one originating in America and the Five Eyes and the homegrown Belgian one – has nothing to do with COVID. It comes from a generalized loss of trust in the robustness of institutions, a vague but pervasive idea that we are screwed, and will always be screwed, and anything new that comes around will just lead to more ways for us to get screwed. It's sad, really."

Of course we can see the cognitive dissonance between those who do not trust the app but feel comfortable sharing deeply personal information on social media networks. I'm sure there are even those who do not trust this app but have volunteered their genetic information to 23andme.

On one hand, that's frustrating. On the other, I'm not sure anon1138917760 we can expect anything different. There is absolutely no formal education on this subject for children or adults in the United States. Congress has been [passing digital privacy legislation for over a half century](https://schmud.de/posts/2020-06-15-personal-privacy.html) and it seems largely ineffective.

Your informal survey is pretty interesting. On your first group, I've found even when I try and educate friends and family who trust me on this issue, they still don't feel like they have enough information.

Good point. This highlights two important differences.

1. The feeling of *pulling* software based on your choice vs. the feeling of software being *pushed* upon you. The pull/push metaphor doesn't completely align, but I think it captures the salient difference.
2. Governments can legitimize detention and violence. They must always be held to the highest standard. History has sanon1138917760n the countless failures of all forms of governance so skepticism is healthy.

The thread title asks *why more people aren't more skeptical* - but I wonder anon1138917760 this observation squares with our ""post-truth"" society and erosion of institutional trust. Or perhaps I'm overstating the latter?"

Barlow’s Declaration of Independence is a double-edged sword. Governments are not welcome here, but a corporation with over a billion users have a different kind of power - one that even the US Congress seems shy to engage directly. 

I’m curious about the political science research here. Is the lack of action unique in the context of Standard Oil and AT&T?

Governments and tech companies are reaching for tech-based tools to help defeat the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the solutions under discussion imply restrictions to civil liberties and human rights, like the right to privacy (here is [Edward Snowden weighing in](https://youtu.be/k5OAjnveyJo)).

This is creating uneasiness in the communities I am a part of – a disturbance in the Force, if you are a Star Wars fan. People worry, but no one is sure what an appropriate diagnosis and response to the situation would be. Is the situation ""problematic"" or ""dystopian""? Can we do anything about it, besides worrying?

You see, there are two kinds of problem. For the first kind, the more knowledge people gain about the problem, the less they worry. For the second kind, the more knowledge they gain, the more they worry. Nuclear power production belongs to the first kind; climate change belongs to the second one. Is government-corporate use of tech surveillance more like nuclear power, or is it more like climate change?

The puzzle is complex, and no single person seems to have all the pieces. But that does not scare me: I am part of Edgeryders, and In Collective Intelligence We Trust. So we organized a [community listening point to touch base with each other.](/t/13089) It was open to anyone, but we made a few targeted invitations to people who hold important pieces of that puzzle. What follows is a summary of what I learned in that meeting. It is only my personal perspective. I make no claim to speak for anyone else. I offer it in a spirit of openness, and in the hope to contribute to a broad, diverse, honest conversation. Taking part in such conversations is, I find, the main way we humans navigate problems as complex as this one.


## About the listening event, and Edgeryders's role in it

The listening event took place on April 9th, at 17.00 CEST as a Zoom conference call. We made it public through [a post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-a-community-listening-session-on-emergent-post-covid-trends-from-contact-tracking-to-special-powers/13089?u=anon1075425386) on the edgeryders.eu online forum. People learned of it mostly through Twitter. I have taken the initiative to reach out to some people whose opinion I was keen to hear. We discussed for two hours, with 32 to 36 people logged in at any given time. About 18 of them spoke at least once – I counted 11 male-sounding voices and 7 female-sounding ones. Their backgrounds and expertise was in:

* The legal community.

* The medical/public health community.

* Digital tech. This was the largest group. People declared specializations in the fields of: information security; privacy; digital identity; artificial intelligence; big data analysis.

* Privacy and human rights online.

* Public policy and democratic participation therein.

* Media.

My colleagues at Edgeryders and I participated as concerned citizens, like everyone else. But we were also working, because we we are part of a project called [NGI Forward](https://research.ngi.eu). Its role is to advise the European Commission on anon1138917760 to ensure that the future Internet upholds our common values of human rights and rule of law.

We adopted Chatham House rules. So, this post reports what people said, but not their names. The call was not recorded; I saved its chat to help me write this writeup, but then deleted the file. The [information sheet](https://bit.ly/SurveillancePandemic) contains full disclosure about our treatment of information from the event.

I take full responsibility for any incorrect reporting, and welcome any integration, correction or additional point of view. Please respond to this post, and let's improve each other's understanding.


## Result 1: there is cause to worry, but also leverage for defense

There are several good reasons to be on our guard.

* Policy makers tend to overestimate the effectiveness of technology-based surveillance vis-a-vis the pandemic. People spoke of pervasive solutionism (in [the sense of Evgeny Mozorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Morozov#To_Save_Everything,_Click_Here:_The_Folly_of_Technological_Solutionism) – ""a anon2726675500 magic dust can fix any problem"").

* Digital surveillance companies are treating COVID-19 as a business opportunity. Some of these have dubious track records on the respect of human rights online. In the words of one participant:

    > In the last week, it's been reported that around a dozen governments are using Palantir software and that the company is in talks with several more. They include agencies in Austria, Canada, Greece and Spain, the US, and the UK.

* The public is scared, so willing to accept almost anything.

Example: in Italy, drones are being used to check distancing in public spaces. There are talks of equipping them with facial recognition algos. Is this necessary? Why? Is it going to become a permanent feature in our cities?

Another example: car manufacturer Ferrari has a plan called ""back on track"". It involves re-opening the factory with a scheme that includes mandatory blood testing and a contact tracing app. Is this the kind of decision that your employer should make for you? What happens if you test positive?

There are two lines of defense against abuse of surveillance tech:

* Data protection laws, starting with the GDPR. They all state that any data retention should be ""necessary and proportionate"" to the need it tries to solve. This is a weak defense, because all such laws provide exceptions for public safety. Also, governments and corporates have a history of ignoring ""necessary and proportionate"".

* If this fails, civil society can invoke the European Convention on Human Rights. This has its own court, which is not part of the EU, and so it is at arm's length from the EU political space.


## Result 2. Contact tracing apps are ineffective against COVID-19, but may help in the next pandemic

Everyone in the call, without exception, agreed that contact tracing apps won't help against COVID-19. The rationale for building one such app, people explained, is to quickly quarantine everyone who got exposed to the first few cases. Once the virus spreads, confinement, as we have now, is a more appropriate measure. It is difficult to think that even the best app would prevent more contacts than people staying at home.

On top of this, these apps are easy to get wrong. Among failure modes, people cited:

* Data governance issues: possible breaches, difficulty to anonymize the data, and so on. More on this below.

* Lock-in effects: for these app to work, they need 50-60% of the population to take them on. It's a ""winner-take-it-all"" service. There is potential for companies to lock authorities into long term contracts, invoke all kinds of confidentiality to protect their business models, and so on. This situation could prevent better solutions from emerging.

* Loss of confidence: if the authorities roll out an app, and it does not deliver, the public may lose confidence in *any* app. This could happen as new cases rise again after lockdown is loosened, as is happening currently across Asia. This might burn an opportunity to help contain the next pandemic at an early stage.

So, why is everyone (including several people in our call!) building contact tracing apps? Because there is a political demand for it. It is linked to the end of the lockdown. Leaders are seen as doing nothing, while leaving people behind locked doors. They are eager to provide solutions. This, anon1138917760ever, is very tricky to do. Evidence from Singapore sanon1138917760s that contact tracing is not working well to prevent new outbreaks. But what are the alternatives? Political leaders are reluctant to tell people ""the danger is over, go back to your lives"". This is sure to backfire in the political arena if the epidemics enters a second wave.

This is where solutionism kicks in: building an app can be presented as ""doing something about it"". On top of that, building apps is much faster, cheaper and easier, than, say, retooling the health care system. So, it's a political win, though not an epidemiological one.

Several people pointed out that it is not a bad idea to build a contact tracing app. But it is a bad idea to rush it, because 

1. To be effective, tracing needs near-universal availability of testing, which is currently not there. Without this, contact tracing need to rely on self-reporting.
2. To be effective, they also need a large, probably unrealistic, uptake (50-60%, where Singapore managed 12%). 
2. We will not need one until the next pandemic. Rushing development might lead to the deployment of evil, ineffective or broken solutions. One participant had this to offer:

> I am currently involved with a group building a contact tracing app. But I am uneasy, actually thank you for giving voice to my anxieties. I do not see my colleagues discussing the use cases for this tech. I do not see them asking themselves if their solution is going to be effective. I do not see them discussing failure modes of the technologies. Almost everybody is hiding their head in the sand about the consequences of these solutions, intended or not.

So, the consensus in the group seemed to be for channeling tech repos

> To keep it simple, most “obvious” solutions in an emergency turn out to be counter productive. […] You need to do your emergency homework in advance, and trust the experts. So for my contribution, I would argue you send every “develop an emergency app”/“do-something-itis” developer to work on *future pandemic* solutions, rather than give them reign in a crisis.

## Result 3. Immunity passports are an unworkable idea

Another idea that is making the rounds is that of [immunity passports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19). The group agreed that they can turn into a civil rights nightmare, As one participant said:

> They are going to be basically ""passport to civil liberties"". There are going to be a lot of perverse incentives around them.

One perverse incentive that came up:

> Would that not create a huge incentive for people to go out and get infected, so they can get natural immunity? So nobody would want to do distancing, and we do not flatten the curve.

Over and above such concerns, it seems unlikely that immunity certificates would be effective. Issuing certificates means that having capacity to do massive-scale testing. We do not have that. If that capacity was there, we would be much better off in fighting COVID-19 with traditional anti-epidemic protocols, and not need immunity certificates. The medical professionals in the call also reminded us that we do not know anon1138917760 immunity works with SARS-CoV-2. How long does it last? Does it prevent reinfection, or only make it weaker? So, it's not even clear what you would be certifying.


## Result 4. Locational data are impossible to anonymize, and of limited utility. Capacity for data governance is bad

Participants agreed that it is not realistic to promise anonymization of locational data. A [famous 2013 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376) sanon1138917760s that human mobility traces are highly unique. Four datapoints were enough to de-anonymize 95% of individuals in a large cellphone operator dataset. As one person put it:

> I never trust a policy maker when they say ""this data is going to be anonymized"". They do not understand what anonymisation means. And any solution will increase the amount of data in play.

As explained above, people were also sceptical on the usefulness of locational data in fighting the pandemic.

> I do not think that you get any useful information from these apps. They will sanon1138917760 that people get infected in places, like supermarkets or hospital, where people HAVE to come into contact with each other.

One participant offered these apps could help in assessing the efficacy of containment measures. That does not require granular data, but only pre-aggregated statistics. A [recent paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/30/science.abb6936.full) on Science argues that it is possible to do this securely. The EFF has just released a [policy proposal](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/covid-19_instant_tracing/blob/master/Policy%20forum%20-%20COVID-19%20containment%20by%20herd%20protection.pdf) on this solution.

This was the one part of the conversation where I felt I could add my bit. After ten years of open data activism, I am pessimistic on the ability of EU governments and companies to do advanced, ethical governance of large datasets. The daily data on confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths are a mess. No standardization, no metadata, collection criteria that keep changing. Belgium, for example, on some days (but not every day!) reports on the same day the sum of two dishomogenous quantities:

* number of people who died in hospital on that day, confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, plus

* number of people who died in the ""last few days"" in retirement homes, not tested ([example](https://www.anon2818709601f.be/info/societe/detail_coronavirus-en-belgique-suivez-en-direct-la-conference-de-presse-du-centre-inter-federal-de-crise-11h?id=10479728)).

Other example: the former head of Italy's pension administration authority deplored the lack of open data on unemployment benefit claims. Scholars and policy makers themselves are flying blind, with no reliable data. How can we trust people who cannot maintain a Google spreadsheet to steward a massive trove of sensitive locational data?

A silver lining in all this is that contact tracing apps were battle-tested ten years ago. This means we have open datasets which can be used to model the impact of public health measures ([example](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/risk/downloads/crs-sao-paolo-virus-pandemic.pdf)). If the goal is modelling, there is no need for more surveillance.


## Result 5. Where to look for (pieces of) the solution

People offered several suggestions for where we could look for solutions, or at least improvements.

* Medical and public health practitioners insisted on good execution over innovation. The WHO protocols, although devised for flu-type viruses, are well suited to coronaviruses as well. But their deployment was late and sloppy. Even at the time of writing, most EU countries cannot test at scale; they cannot provide adequate equipment. The medical community sees this emphasis on tech as misdirection. Part of any solution is to do public health well, without cutting corners. One participant from Italy remarked:

    > For example, we closed schools and universities, but did not inform students that they should not be hanging out with their friends. We did not tell students from different cities and regions to go back home. The rules are simple: if you are ill, tell your friends, and tell them to get tested. But in Italy it is hard to get tested, so the whole protocol fails. Contact tracing is the last thing we need. It is useless from a public health efficacy point of view, and not proportionate.

* Other participants highlighted the positive of labor-intensive ""boots on the ground"". A participant from the UK remarked:

    > I am worried that people fall off the cracks, because they are not on government databases and we do not see them. Maybe they are disabled, but have a job. They never touch the state, and fund their own care. I am worried about people with learning disabilities, for example. If you are not on social media, you have not seen the messages of your local authority, telling you where to get help.

* Several people remarked that the tech community can have the greatest impact by playing a support role. They identified three areas to do this in. One is supporting what doctors are already doing, for example remote diagnosis or e-mail prescriptions. Another is supporting community organizers – another example of ""boots on the ground"". The third one is the people manning the supply chain.

* The tech community might find an important role to play in protecting the most vulnerable individuals from the worst consequences of the pandemic, and of the measures adopted to fight it. This was not mentioned in the call, but rather proposed in the ensuing online discussion. 

[quote=""anon2879402825, post:23, topic:13183""]
Dare I say that if tech wants to make a contribution, a great way to do it, would be exploring the causal factors behind why minorities communities are being hit harder or perhaps not receiving the help required during this pandemic.
[/quote]

* Several people suggested that studying history (of epidemics, of technologies, of health and technology policies) could be useful. Solutionism has been with us for a long time (at least since the 1950s, according to a participant). Studying its successes (not many) and failure modes (many more) might help us not make the same mistake twice.

The argument in the call seems to be: yes, but the *problems* being tackled had more chances to be useful ones to solve. During WW2 govts were using their powers to order Rolls Royce to make plane engines, not to devise schemes to know where people were when the were supposed to be in bomb shelters. 

The medical people in the call support testing and proximity medicine over contact tracing apps. You could scramble for solutions on those, but someanon1138917760 you don't, and all the oxygen is on apps. Solutionism, à la Mozorov. I guess a strong suspicion here is that leadership has become optimized for posturing and attention-grabbing, which wins elections in quiet times, and so it is out of its depth when faced with an urgent crisis. But this is  only my own guess, no one said it in the call."

I see @anon2879402825 has linked to Ross Anderson's post, which makes several of the points I think are most relevant; not just for the UK.

Without (near) universally available testing, the apps alone will have to rely on self-reporting which - combined with the many unresolved, very real issues around using 'device proximity + time duration' as a proxy for infection (not to mention deliberate misuse) - means the quality of information driving the alerts will likely be too low for the apps to retain credibility, thus compliance. Or, to paraphrase Ross, why would people self-isolate just because a slightly creepy experimental app with 'invisible smarts' tells them they should?

Contact tracing works because it erects a 'barrier' around a known infected person by testing everyone they've been in close contact with, and quarantining not only the original infected person but any who have been infected by them (and then the ones they've infected) - even *before* they are symptomatic. We don't (only) need apps, for the apps to work - we need more human contact tracers and tests! (In the UK, probably around 20,000 of them.)"
20,74448,2020-04-15T23:03:39.280Z,13183,1,25,24,1,0,0,30.0,74446,anon1548077507,anon1548077507,"It is generally acknowledged that, all other issues aside, for the contact tracing app in the UK to 'work' (though it's not entirely clear what the Governement means by that) would require 50-60% of the population to be using it - so, as a system, the apps act like a sort of 'virtual herd immunity'.

Such uptake is clearly HUGELY ambitious - Singapore managed 12% - and, as I've said, the app alone (without testing) neither gets you the information quality you need for compliance, nor erects the specific 'barriers' around the infected that you need for effect. Once this becomes generally known amongst the public (i.e. as new cases rise again after lockdown is loosened, as is happening curently across Asia) then 'the app' is a bust.

So, until we either develop herd immunity naturally (at the cost of an unacceptably large numbers of deaths) or until we develop and distribute a vaccine, we are left with the Hammer and the Dance:
https://medium.com/@anon

Tech developed in this pandemic *may* be able to help extend the gaps between lockdowns (I hope it will!) but we're well past the point at which any contact tracing app could reasonably have helped contain the spread, so it's about cycles of suppression & mitigation, as per, e.g. <image here>

* Tracing apps do not work without testing capacity.
* Even if you do have testing capacity, for tracing apps to work there needs to be a level of uptake that is probably unrealistic:

* Furthermore, if you *do* have testing capacity, there are many other things that could work.

So, it seems to me you two are saying: if there is a sprint response to do here, authorities should focus on the testing itself. Tech, on the other hand, should be redirected to preparedness:

The chaos of the *MERS* outbreak had left the public with a grim conviction: sacrificing some individual privacy was simply the upfront cost of avoiding more debilitating consequences down the line.

Despite its imperfections, South Korea’s policy is striking for the fact that it brings the mechanisms and outcomes of surveillance into the public forum. In doing so, it appeals to a deeper sense of civic trust—the belief that, in a crisis, the citizenry can be relied upon to play its part.

This of course is based on a high level of surveillance, “This is one of the benefits of having a universal health-care system,' Eom told me, gesturing behind us. 'When they enter your personal identification number, they can review your travel history.”"

I'm curious about other people's thoughts on this development. It looks like a 'middle way' that is better than much of what was on the table. The two red flags for me:

1. The solution is corporate controlled and the actual implementation is closed-source. 
2. Many epidemiologists are skeptical of automated contract tracing's effectiveness.

I am impressed that you consider the Apple-Google exposure notification tech CCC-compliant. That is more than I hoped for. Also, I like your list of dangers, and the point about these apps being somewhere between ""potentially helpful, given cheap and rapid testing"" to  ""totally useless"" was brought up by several people, also during the Surveillance Pandemic call. In general, the Magic Covid App reminds me of ""if we had a loaf of bread, we could make a chicken sandwich, if we had some chicken""; where the app is the bread, and testing capacity is the chicken. Your final list of privacy-infringing government actions is also chilling. 

I also have a question for you. If the Apple-Google code is not open source, on what basis is the infosec community evaluating its cryptographic soundness?"

I used some pretty imprecise language when talking about CCC compliance. Your post made me revisit that footnote and include the Nexa Institute's [Open Letter](https://nexa.polito.it/lettera-aperta-app-COVID19).

My original anon3386180186e was favorable because I was a anon2726675500 surprised anon1138917760 many of the boxes Apple/Google managed to check. I didn't expect them to open source the effort. But I also didn't expect them to come up with a decentralized solution. It makes sense in hindsight. Apple has demonstrated that they really *do not want to be caught holding the keys* and answering a government subpoena. 

Obviously infosec cannot vouch for the soundness of this implementation. It only ""seems like"" sound cryptography (using my words in the article). The problems will arise post-facto. An analyst like [Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/) would argue that Apple absolutely must deliver the promises they make in their white paper. For example, they have taken the reputation of iMessage very seriously - it may be their most valuable software asset outside of OSX/iOS. Failing to do so could affect their bottom line and shareholder value.

The only other thing we have to go on is their inspiration, the open source [D3-PT](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents#apple-and-google-proposal).

So yeah, the fact it's not open source is a real shame. I think you and I would both agree that Apple/Google could benefit tremendously by making it open source. I'm not sure why it is closed. Any ideas? They both run plenty of open source projects.

And indeed, testing is the chicken."

NSA requests for backdoors are a anon2726675500 less fashionable after [the CIA spied on the Senate in 2014](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/11/politics/senate-cia/index.html). But this pendulum has swung back and forth with congress and the intelligence committee since the 1970s. I'm sure it will continue.

I was referencing the Apple/FBI fight after the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. If you remember, the FBI used the courts to try to make Apple hand over information - essentially forcing open a back door. Apple changed iMessage encryption after this incident, which offers two advantages.

1. They can't hand over keys if they don't have them.
2. They can't build a backdoor if they don't even have a front door.

I don't have any predictions about anon1138917760 this will play out in the future, but this is the precedent from the last five years. So it makes sense that Apple would adopt a technology where they have no access to user data. It's the safest for them.

They are not directly related to the ""magic COVID app"", but they do resonate with some of the arguments we explored in this event. 

### 1. Restricted freedoms in Asia-Pacific

Earlier this week, the Open Government Partnership held [this meeting](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/events/open-response-open-recovery-inclusive-participation-and-civic-space-in-times-of-crisis/). They found robust evidence that states inclined towards authoritarianism exploited the pandemic to increase surveillance and restricts liberties. Most countries in the region are also restricting the publication of data on the pandemic itself, presumably so that they control the narrative and keep their nations in a perpetual state of fear. Authoritarians love fear, because it makes government overreach more acceptable. 

I am not convinced that this is only an Asian phenomenon. In my own native Italy, 19 regions out of 20 refuse to publish open data on COVID-19 ([thoughtful post by Matteo Brunati]
(http://www.dagoneye.it/blog/2020/06/18/governo-non-aperto-serve-spinta-open-government/), in Italian). 
![image|370x227](upload://j2EfXJhOyl3MiFg2Qy4EkPNEUve.png) 

### 2. Smart city infrastructure re-deployed to counter-demonstration surveillance in the USA

The city of San Diego, in progressive California, has 4,000 smart traffic lights. Which have cameras. Which store their footage on some server farm. Turns out [San Diego police are now accessing that footage](https://distincttoday.net/2020/07/01/san-diego-police-accessed-smart-streetlights-camera-footage-to-spy-on-black-lives-matter-protests/) in search of material to incriminate Black Lives Matter protestors. The whole thing [had been predicted](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/smart-cities-surveillance-and-new-streetlights-san-jose) by the EFF in 2017, and this lends some strength to slippery slope-type arguments whenever someone wants more monitoring and more data on the spaces where humans live. 

We are still very far from a bottom line on the consequences of SARS-COV-2 on the Internet and anon1138917760 humans use it. But the shadows are deepening, and I fear that the opportunists thinking the pandemic is a good excuse for getting more surveillance tech in place... are mostly right."

This concern about using Zoom proved to be a good one, given recent news stories about privacy issues with the platform.

### What worked well/ not so well with the e-learning shift, and working as an educator online?

At the start of this crisis teachers had been on strike in the UK nationwide for two weeks before. The crisis refocused everything, because many Higher Education Institutions have made recent financial announcements to lay people off (‘furlough’ them), if their roles were not considered essential at this time. Some disciplines (eg Arts and Humanities) feel more vulnerable in these circumstances. Furloughed staff are able to claim 80% of their wages from the Government but it is unclear anon1138917760 long this might be for or what the future might hold for all staff in the sector.

### Challenges of eLearning and mental health

The main challenge with eLearning is going to be to enable students to continue to complete assessments. Many staff have experienced the mental impact of having to move to new and unfamiliar ways of working. When we asked about anon1138917760 students are doing, @anon637887749 said:

> I think the mental impact on students is huge and is not always fully appreciated by Higher Education Institutions. In the UK there is a real epidemic of anxiety and mental health issues among youngsters [in general]. Is this similar in other countries?

From my experience, this is very true. We have also moved all of our university classes online. What the students are missing more than anything is the social atmosphere of the university -- I hear them saying they miss their cohort (these are Masters students), working on class projects and papers together (even just being in the same space, not even collaborating), taking breaks from study together. So much of learning is in the in-between, when formal lectures aren't happening. That stuff is hard to replicate online. 

And it's interesting that you bring up mental health, @anon3529867364, because I think what we found more than anything in Open Care is that having a strong sense of community massively helps with mental health issues. I just read the book Happy City, and the author finds the same thing --- *ambient* community feeling keeps us happy -- the people we chat to when we go get our morning coffee and all the people we recognise as we go about our daily lives. These points of contact are really important for the students as well -- it's not the formal learning that they're missing the most, it's all the ambient touchpoints that they no longer have. 

Space makes a huge difference -- being at the university brings a sense of scholarly-ness that makes diving into writing easier. These ambient effects are hard to replicate digitally. But people are trying! With things like digital study groups (we call them ""Shut Up and Write"" sessions, where you leave the webcam on and quietly study with others) and sites that create ambient sounds of coffeeshops and libraries."

I can only imagine - especially for those living alone - anon1138917760 much of a difference it makes to be connected to anything resembling social life.

Exactly -- this is what is sorely missing. There's also no moving somewhere else for a change of pace, a different kind of inspiration, to find another angle.

The Czech government decided for anon2298377336 a strict regime, which funnily enough, has been ruled to be implemented in an illegal manner just today by a court decision (on occasions, the rules were changing multiple times a day): 

https://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/prague-court-cancels-anti-coronavirus-restrictions-on-free-movement-retail-sales

However, changing the scene, as Amelia mentions, is something I sorely miss. I was blessed (in the social dimension of it definitely) with bouncing each week between two workplaces I have at the University, which makes my usual rhythm relatively dynamic. I personally consider the high number of colleagues I meet to be the actual win.

So we just decided this Tuesday to meet up in three people in our study room/lab and make plans for the rest of the semester/quarantine, taking advantage of the relaxed measures. As the room is big enough, we could keep some safe distance, have a coffee and talk in person. And no one seemed eager to be the first to leave, we actually stood by the door for additional 15 mins. 

Generally, we do not know when the Universities will allow students or public back in, but I hope we will keep these weekly mental revival sessions. Nevertheless, it is a privilege to have basically private premises which can serve such a purpose. The other institute I am teaching at holds weekly meetings of 30-60 people online to make up for the lack of verbal contact, but no one has come up with a ""Shut Up and Write"" online sessions yet, though the institute operates a ""silent room"" under normal circumstances. I am just not sure if the simple joy of talking would not override the first principle of the above-mentioned concept:)"

**'mental revival sessions',** well said! There is talking, and there is hanging out. And no virtual room will replace the hanging out unless you probably have years of accommodating. But definitely less so if that's *the only place* you work or meet people. I think it's because you cannot meet others in real life that the virtual sanon1138917760s its limitations. 

Friends of mine are reaching out because they are swamped with too many calls and the medium is much more tiring for them than real life. Others are hosting Bdays virtually (@anon846549441 and other friends!). So lucky you that you can meet your colleagues!

We talked about things like the impermanence of positions, the danger in France and other countries to follow the liberal model and therefore making less and less space for novel, different academic voices. We also asked ourselves what is there for young people today who wish to join the Academia? And finally, there were also mentions of sexual harassment being problematic in the academic environment.

## Join the webinar to get introduces to giant research of Covid19 related data and interpret and discuss it live together.

# How to read and interpret data?


As we at NGI Forward watched SARS-CoV-2 cut into our worlds, we felt the same as everybody else. We feared for loved ones, and for the long-term freedom and prosperity of our societies. We felt powerless, and anxious in the face of uncertainty. We still do.

But, at some point along the way, we realized there was something we could do. We have in our midst a team of data scientists. When the pandemic hit, Kristof and Michal were analysing trends in the evolution of Internet technology. Theirs is a big data method: they do text analysis on large repositories of academic papers, news articles, social media. We realized we could use the same method to investigate the virus and its companion illness. It would be like redirecting our searchlight onto a new target.

**So we did that. In the space of only a few weeks, Kristof and Michal came back with results, neatly arranged in [an interactive website ](https://covid.delabapps.eu/). And that’s where we need your help.**

*Here’s the thing: this type of analysis scales well, but its results are not easy to interpret. We can see, for example, that technologies associated with the pandemic fall into four groups: remote work, medical, social distancing, contact tracing. This makes sense at first sight, but what does it mean? That people are using these technologies a lot? That researchers are working to improve these technologies over others? Or is the result an artifact of the way we look at the data? Is there a way that we can determine if there are obvious gaps in our technological arsenal? If we found any, we could look into investing to plug them.*

This type of analysis becomes much more actionable when you provide context to it. As I pored over early results, I could not help notice a positive sentiment for [PEPP-PT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-European_Privacy-Preserving_Proximity_Tracing). Except that, in the very same days, the PEPP-PT consortium had collapsed due to the withdrawal of several research institutes over privacy concerns. Before the collapse, I might have interpreted the positive sentiment as validation. “Look, the tech community likes this protocol!”. In the light of the collapse, it made more sense to read it as naïve enthusiasm, or even spin. A possible interpretation could be: “it is a good idea to let the community poke holes in any specific solution before we endorse it”. Another one is: “scientists and engineers are still humans. In a crisis, they reach for a solution, and want it to work. Their critical abilities are, for a time, weakened.”

**In sum, we have a large trove of data on COVID-19, which seems to hold important knowledge, if we could just unlock it. So, we propose an experiment. Let’s get together (online), and question the data.** 
Let’s look at them, turn them around in our heads, interrogate each other on their possible meaning. Let’s formulate hypoteses, and see if we can think of ways to test them. Kristof and Michal can transform them into queries and visualization in real time, or close enough. In other words, let’s augment big data analysis with collective intelligence methods. It will be a way for us to learn more about both COVID-19 and this particular big data methodology.

[quote=""anon1075425386, post:1, topic:13183""]
## Result 1: there is cause to worry, but also leverage for defense

There are several good reasons to be on our guard.

* Policy makers tend to overestimate the effectiveness of technology-based surveillance vis-a-vis the pandemic. People spoke of pervasive solutionism (in [the sense of Evgeny Mozorov ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeny_Morozov#To_Save_Everything,_Click_Here:_The_Folly_of_Technological_Solutionism) – “a anon2726675500 magic dust can fix any problem”).
* Digital surveillance companies are treating COVID-19 as a business opportunity. Some of these have dubious track records on the respect of human rights online. In the words of one participant:
> In the last week, it’s been reported that around a dozen governments are using Palantir software and that the company is in talks with several more. They include agencies in Austria, Canada, Greece and Spain, the US, and the UK.

* The public is scared, so willing to accept almost anything.
[/quote]

Look for ""solutionist"" language (solution, effective, efficient, real-time, scalable etc.). See if it trends (but do we have a counterfactual?); see if it co-occurs with epidemics language (COVID, Coronavirus, pandemic) and tech solutions thereto (contact tracing app), especially linked to surveillance companies (Palantir, others?). See if the sentiment is positive. If none of these occur, the hypothesis is not supported.

[quote=""anon1075425386, post:1, topic:13183""]
## Result 2. Contact tracing apps are ineffective against COVID-19, but may help in the next pandemic
[...] Among failure modes, people cited:

* Data governance issues: possible breaches, difficulty to anonymize the data, and so on. More on this below.
* Lock-in effects: for these app to work, they need 50-60% of the population to take them on. It’s a “winner-take-it-all” service. There is potential for companies to lock authorities into long term contracts, invoke all kinds of confidentiality to protect their business models, and so on. This situation could prevent better solutions from emerging.
* Loss of confidence: if the authorities roll out an app, and it does not deliver, the public may lose confidence in *any* app. This could happen as new cases rise again after lockdown is loosened, as is happening currently across Asia. This might burn an opportunity to help contain the next pandemic at an early stage.
[/quote]

Repeat the game: identify a batch of words related to  anonymity (anonymize, breach, locational) and another linked to the possible issues identified by the Surveillance Pandemic focus group (takeup, adoption, lock-in, credibility, confidence), then look at occurrence, co-occurrence and sentiment. 

You get the idea. We can do the same with results 3 on immunity passports and 4  on locational data."

**Host:** 
Welcome everybody to this NGI Forward COVID-19 presentation and discussion. Our guests of honour here from DE Lab in Poland, Kristof Gyodi and Michal Palinski will begin with a presentation of their findings. They will take over the screen for about 20 minutes. Then a robust discussion should get going. I'm John from EdgeRyders and Louis from Nesta. We are the hosts of this meeting. Maria is going to be looking after the chat part. I will facilitate the discussion which probably won't take a lot of work, and we know that the chat is an important component of the discussion. Sometimes important things get entered into the chat when a lot of people are talking so if you have an important point you want to bring up and you can't find a way to work your way into the conversation, you can put it in the chat and we will try to bring it onto the table for everybody. So with that, I think we're ready to go. I want to also remind everybody that we are recording this and that you have agreed to it. Alright, without further ado, let's go now forward to the presentation from DE Lab.

**Michal:**  
Thank you, John, for that introduction. My name is Michal Palinski, and together with Kristof Gyodi will try to present you today's topic that is social challenges brought by COVID-19. We have both analysis from the study economic lab at University of Warsaw and PhD candidates at Faculty of Economic Sciences also at the University of Warsaw, so we work mainly in a project that is called NGI Forward. Maybe you heard about it. It's a project brought by European Commission to identify the main technologies and interrelated social issues in relation to the internet and our role at the D lab is to bring numerous analyses, data science analysis involved in machine learning, web scraping and natural language processing to this topic.  One leg of this project is to provide analysis related to COVID-19 pandemic. And we tried to combine numerous methodologies we use day to day in our NGI Forward project to this challenge, and we would like to sanon1138917760 you some of the results. Okay, I will share my screen now, so that you can see our website. If you didn't see the invitation then the address is https://covid.delabapps.eu/. There you can find our results, our visualizations.

 I will introduce our main idea.  We wanted to analyze four main areas. That is news about recent technologies: Social media. We chose Reddit because of its popularity. When it comes to open source we chose GitHub Repositories. And we also analyzed scientific papers, mainly Social Science Research Network, and data sets that are openly available. When it comes to news about COVID-19, we have analyzed around I think it was finally 11 news outlets in English that covers technology and wanted to see what are the technological angles with this recent pandemic.  

We have identified some growing trends. Here you can see these bubbles that represent keywords we have identified using some basic linear regression analysis, and we have divided these keywords into two main groups. The first one you can see clusters of keywords that are related solid to this pandemic, in the second bubble, you can see some of the keywords related to technologies. So the bigger the bubble is, the more robust the trend is of the selected keyword. So for example, you can see that in the recent months, such issues as social distancing, or short term rental, Air BnB or the issues related to unemployment are getting traction, you can think about some keywords that you can find interesting right now, and we can check them in Python and see whether they are growing or not. And recently, is the same with technologies, we can see what types of technologies are getting traction recently, so you can comment in the chat and we can check whether they are trending or not. So this is the first bit of our analysis, the most high level let's say.  Maybe I will mention that our analysis is semi-automatic, so we use many automated tools. But also some experts analysis was involved as in the case of this of these bubbles because we have used this as a regression to identify trends. And then with Kristof, we have clustered these keywords into these nice bubbles.

**Kristof:**  
Yeah. And following this identification of main words, we were interested in to dive deeper into these news stories. So what we did next was that we analyzed the sentiment of the text. So if sentiment analysis, you can tell if the text is rather positive, negative, or maybe in between in sentiment. So now we'll draw based on the words of the text. So what we did was that we select some of the interesting news stories that are maybe more controversial, such as news stories related to contact tracing or news stories related to Zoom. And we did two things. First, we examine which are the words are frequently mentioned together, for example, with Zoom. So we identified all of the paragraphs that contain the word Zoom and examine, which are the words that are also frequently in these paragraphs. 

The second thing was that we calculated the sentiment of these paragraphs and rank these word combinations based on the sentiment. So this way we were able to see first, which are the frequent combinations, and second, which are the positive and which are the negative relationships. So we had all the stories of some of these controversial views. So as an example, in the case of Zoom, the big dab that's those paragraphs that covered on the technology itself, on this video conferencing aspect on the different use case, it is rather positive. On the other hand, there were recently lots of sketchy stories about uninvited guests. So that's why we have also this password for this meeting. So different pranksters There's sanon1138917760 up and violate meetings. And actually, this is also featured in the news about Zoom. And we calculated the sentiment and it was negative or in this neutral zone. So we prepared similar news stories related to contact tracing as well. So you can see which are the positive sides of this technology. And also, which are the negative issues such as privacy, the use of location data, and similar issues. Also, we identified, which are relevant actors, and so on. So this kind of tool has been very useful for us to quickly map out the main angles of a new story. 

The second thing that we want to highlight is related to the matter of articles. And here we use a different machine learning tool and define that an algorithm called C SME has been very useful in this type of analysis. So our idea was to prepare a map, where articles that cover the same topic are in close vicinity to each other. So neighbouring points should report on the same news story. And here this location of the point is determined by this algorithm for colour, it was used another algorithm called topic modelling. And this is a different methodology. But in theory, we should have points that are on the same colour and should focus on the same topic. And on the other hand, points that are close to each other should be reporting on the same news or something related to each other. And basically, that's what the map is sanon1138917760ing us. So now Michal is sanon1138917760ing, for example, the dots in the northern section. These are the news stories on Zoom. So all the points are reporting here on Zoom, whether it is something positive or negative. We also picked out interesting clusters such as new stories about contact tracing, so now Michal is sanon1138917760ing you this area of the map where you have reporting of the different initiatives, different national projects, also some concerns related to this technology. And we also found some other clusters related to companies. So for example, this is related to Facebook. In the southern section, we identify the news on Amazon. And again, these are the new studies related to COVID-19. So it enabled us to have a quick visual background of all the major topics and news reporting on recent developments.

**Michal:**  
Okay, so another area we have analyzed was social media. Here we wander to each social media to choose whether to Twitter Facebook. Finally, we have chosen Reddit data we have analyzed both comments and also on Reddit because of its popularity among tech enthusiasts. Here using Reddit data, we can also analyze certain keywords have chosen some sub-areas related to the job market mental health your app that is used in remote work and communication. We have analyzed trends of these keywords. Here, for example, you can see trends of comments and posts that cover a topic of face masks. And so major restriction around the word for it now. As you can see, in this graph, there is an exponential growth of comments about this topic. And this will be a case with many of our graphs. So exponential growth is not only related to infections, but it's also visible in social data. Here you can see anon1138917760 this issue of wearing a face mask was growing in popularity on Reddit in the recent month, the peak was at the beginning of April. Of course, you can then do this analysis on a more granular level. So you can see in which countries The discussion was most present. We also tried to map this issue in a timeline. We should update it because most of you know in Poland, we don't need to wear masks in public right now only in the rooms and buildings. Another area we wanted to cover was a threat to mental health. Because of the isolation, it was a very contentious issue. And we hypothesised that there will be a growing activity in subreddits that are related to such issues as anxiety, depression or suicide watch, and it was actually the case at least with the anxiety. As you can see that in the graph the number of comments in subreddit anxiety was skyrocketing at the beginning of March, which is really troublesome and it might be a good tool for policy. For example, interest monitor public attitudes towards Isolation quarantined and restrictions.

**Kristof:**  
And the other aspect of COVID-19 is the economic impact. And so we were also interested in to see if we can track any activity on Reddit related to the change of the economy. And you can see that the discussion around, for example, unemployment really skyrocketed. So there was a huge influx of comments that were covering unemployment from less than 1000 a day to almost 10,000. And so it suggests that there was a growing tension. We also know now from macro data that in fact, there's a really high share of people losing their jobs across the world. So in the case of the labour market graph, it is containing the number of commands that contain unemployed or unemployment. In the case of automation. They also were interested in to see there is a more lively discussion around automation tools, I guess, a risk that it would be also a long term solution to some of the recent problems in supply chains, in problems related to the pandemic. And you can see on the graph that from mid-March, there was increased activity on Reddit relates to automation robots and such words. The other thing that we did was we identified or examined, which are the subreddits that have been more activities related to discussions on unemployment. And on this graph, you can see the name of the subreddits and this gives us some ideas about the discussions. So on the one hand, you have stuff related to the economy, such as the small business subreddit, or legal advice. You have also this personnel aspect that is happening such as subreddits on personal finance, ""off my chest."" Also, the mental health side that is now very important, maybe a bit neglected part of COVID-19, and so on. So this graph summarizes all the side of the challenge that is happening on the labour markets.

**Michal:**  
Another wanted to see the competition among these remote work apps. And here we can see some interesting trends. For example, Skype experienced a surge in comments on Reddit. So probably it was the tool of the first choice. And then you can see this decreasing trend does a different story with such tools as discord, or even zoom, which plateaued after a while but it didn't experience a huge downward trend. Although Kristof mentioned some problems with zoom right, but it didn't affect at least popularity on Reddit. 

What we thought might be interesting from the policymakers' perspective was word comments about lockdown and lockdown easing lockdown protests also. Wanted to see whether communities on Reddit are commenting about this issue. And we thought it might be a nice tool to monitor the public sentiment about lockdown in quarantine. For example, anti-lockdown protests increased. There was a search in the middle of April, probably related to the situation in the US. As you know, there was anon2298377336 a contentious issue there. And is recently it's even more right. You can see that lockdown easing experienced this huge growth from the middle of March. We can see it in the Reddit data. So one thing is this activity in the social media but another thing is this actual sentiment because we can speak about lockdown easing but what is your opinion about it, right? So we have applied sentiment analysis, this increase I have explained to you in the beginning. And this is just the beginning of our analysis. But we can see that after an initial negative sentiment, this is the mean sentiment, let's remember that.  But the sentiment at the beginning about lockdown was pretty negative and in the next month of April and May, it is more and more positive. How you can interpret those values? So the scale is from minus one to plus one, where minus one is really, really negative. And the last one is super excited. We usually say that when sentiment is around point two, it is meant to be anon2298377336 positive. So right now this lockdown party so the comments about lockdown are in the neutral or slightly positive area. What we want to examine in the future is to see what is the distribution of the sentiments? Because right now, it's just a mean. But we will be happy to hear your ideas, anon1138917760 we can make some deep dives into it to examine what are the changes in perception of lockdown. 

**Kristof:**  
The final section. Well, we want to dive a bit deeper. Now if your is related to open source projects, there are projects on GitHub. And the thing that we did first was that we collected the metadata for all the projects that mention COVID-19 in their title or the project description, and we identified the projects and also the location of the developer who prepared the project. And they certainly are able to track the number of projects geographically and also dynamically over time anon1138917760 the number of projects evolved. So if you run the video, then you can see The 15 most important countries on GitHub in this COVID-19 project section, and you can see some interesting things happening. So naturally, in the US and in Europe, we have a great amount of projects, also in India, and in South America. So basically, it's all around the world. But you have these countries where you have anon2298377336 a lot of open-source activity going on. And the other thing that is interesting is China because this was the epicentre of the pandemic, already there were projects early on from China in the first week, the time period that we are tracking.  However, at some point, the rest of the world, really to cap the number of projects and China remain that relatively low number of projects. So this is an interesting question, anon1138917760 come that the number of projects remains relatively low in China? We don't have a specific answer to this because we are more interested in at this point, to map out the data and see what's going on. So we don't really know the answers to the why's. But it can be interesting to observe anon1138917760 the societies work, and what is the role of the state, across the world. So it can be that in China, maybe it is not the best idea to have this kind of individual approaches to have a say in very important social issues. Maybe the state is taking a stronger stance in these kinds of things where location data and technology is involved. On the other hand, we have Europe where we have a less efficient state, taking your fight against Coronavirus. And also there's much greater opportunity for individuals to put together these kinds of projects and just release them to the world. And related to this, we also have some interesting stories. For example, the number of new projects that are released every day.

**Michal:**  
So again, you can see another exponential growth here. But this initial rush is slowing down in recent weeks. And we wonder what is going on? Was it just a phase and after this initial rush, the activity is slowing down. And what we want to examine right now is whether the activity in this repositories is still going on or not. But you can see that there are still, at the beginning of May, there were still around 400 repositories a day created at GitHub, GitHub alone, but you still have Git Lab and other repositories. So in my opinion, it's unprecedented. I haven't done an analysis of GitHub in a large area, but it seems that this is an unprecedented issue. 

We have analyzed what are the keywords in the introductions of these repositories. And what's interesting is that you can see that mostly they are aimed at visualizing this epidemic and creating apps. I thought that there will be more mortals that are aiming at explaining forecasting the number of infections and, and the victims of this pandemic. But it seems that communities mostly focused on creating dashboards and web visualizing tools. You can see also what are the main languages used in this project. This distribution is a bit different than in case of overall GitHub as we have checked, so there is more of Jupiter's. So it seems that people are creating some data science projects that can be easily transferred to other users. 

We have also checked what are the most popular repositories. So here you can see the So table which ranks repositories related to COVID-19 on GitHub, which has the biggest number of forks, and watchers and so on. And it's not surprising that in the first place, there is this repository by Johns Hopkins University, which is one of the main sources around the world, providing a number of infected people and deaths from COVID-19. But you can see some interesting examples here. For example, number seven is 2019, and COVID memory, which is no longer on GitHub. This is the case Kristof told you earlier. So this is the suppository from Wuhan, which covered stories, memories of 100 residents related to COVID-19 and was censored.  And the creator of this repository is in jail right now in China and it's no longer available. It was available when we scraped the data. But right now, you will see just this website with input that it's no longer available. And in the beginning, we were surprised because we didn't know the story, the background story. And then we read all these articles about the censoring, censoring open source projects in China. So it's an interesting case where you first see something in data and then you read the newspapers. But as John mentioned in the beginning, there is such a flood of information about this issue that you've got to streamline it in a bit.

**Kristof:** 
Yeah, so that's maybe these were the most relevant before the research. We have also other graphs or even other data sources because we also need at the answer some graphs about research papers, also geographical analysis is related to research. You can also find some of the codes for our tours, anon1138917760 the research can be replicated and also some tutorials related to using the code. So if you are interested in data science and you have relatively basic programming skills, then using our tutorials, you will be able to read about the different functions, and also fire up the cords yourself and check for different words, topics and so on. So this was the introduction to our research. And now we are very happy to answer the questions. I see that the chat has been anon2298377336 active.

Host:  
Thank you very much. First questions were just simply: did you pick your keywords based on frequency count?

Kristof:  
So at the beginning where we had this visualization with the bubbles than what we did was, we calculated an average value for frequencies. So what is the average time per two years per article and we did an average Across all the sources for different periods of time, and this was the basis for identifying well, which are the words that are gaining traction that is more and more frequently are used. So yes, that was related to frequency.

**Michal:**  
You can see our example. So I just checked or BBP (?). So this standard preserving privacy and conduct tracing. and here we can see the growing frequency of this word.

**Audience comment:**  
*So it's based on the time difference, not on the frequency count, absolute frequency count, per se. I'm trying to understand what the null model is, anon1138917760 can you say one thing is more frequently than another?*

**Michal:**  
So we have different options. We can check for a mean of all weeks, let's say, or we can see what is the biggest difference between the beginning and the end, right?  So we can also do some normalizations. We have experimented with different methods. But first of all, we see which of these words are characterized by growing popularity in the whole period. And then we choose this which had the biggest positive trend overall these weeks.

**Kristof:** 
So the basic idea is that for every more for every source, we have this average frequency, recreate for every month a weighted value based on the source. And then we have this regression, where we can calculate these trends. How did this frequency evolve over time? So, here what was also a tricky thing is to try to make justice for different sources, because we have very big sources such as TechCrunch or Reuters. We also have a bunch of small but relevant in the European discussion, like <unknown>, <unknown>, so we had different approaches. We had one approach where it was a weighted average, so the size of the source, the number of articles published by the source has been the basis of the weight. So that was anon1138917760 we rated the values. But we also had a version where we gave equal weight for every source, or we even give higher priority for the smaller ones, but the ones that can maybe have greater coverage of social issues. So there was also some results, not in this analysis, because here we have anon2298377336 a small time period. So now we are just analyzing news from the beginning of January until the beginning of May. But during the entire activation internet projects, we have been collecting articles for anon2298377336 a lot of time - for around three and a half years. And then we had some greater space on anon1138917760 to solve this issue.

**Audience comment:**  
*And all of the 52 Top Words were all COVID relevant.*

**Kristof:**  
So here at the first visualization, where do we have the bubbles, it has been filtered by us based on the top thousand trending words. So we created this list, which is the top thousand most sounding words. And then we started to filter out the relevant terms. So that's why this tool is semi-automatic. So it enables to relatively quickly identify the trending terms. And the task is especially easy when you can see the different relationships and anon1138917760 the topics come together. So for example, social distancing, and lockdown and so on. So these words appeared at the beginning of the list.

**Audience comment:**  
*I wanted to ask you if it's possible, or it doesn't even make sense to compare these trends that you're presenting to other trends that might have occurred in other major events of 21st century like for example, in 2008, global economic depression, because I guess that anxiety was also one of the trending words. So maybe it's worth looking into it.*

**Michal:**  
This is a very nice idea. The problem is to have comparable sources because I wonder if social media data is available for this period.

**Kristof:**  
It's a very interesting suggestion. And I'm sure that someone has already done something like that because social media data is getting increasingly relevant also in macroeconomics, so anon1138917760 to forecast economic events based around words in use, and so on. So we don't know the answer to this specifically if we can use Reddit for 2008. My intuition is that yes, and I'm sure that that it is it would be very interesting research, and hopefully someone will do that. Maybe we will find time as you say because that's an emerging research area so anon1138917760 to use social data for also in this context.

**Audience comment:**  
*Okay, so let's, let's imagine that we can actually compare this data. You find the time and you find the source and everything is nice and beautiful. What kind of conclusions could you draw from such a comparison? Because those are major events. But they're hardly comparable when it comes to the trigger that started these events, and anon1138917760 people respond to the timelines. So if you were to compare it, I guess my question is, what kind of scientific question you would like to answer with your research and with your data?*

**Michal:**  
First of all, I've just checked and subreddit for anxiety was created in 2008. It might be the case that we could do it.

**Audience comment:**  
*I am from the University of Warsaw. And I'm curious, did you consider sharing this data in some subReddits, maybe some nationalism Subreddits. I'm very curious about anon1138917760 their editors were faced with this data.*

**Michal:**
So when it comes to visualizations, I guess we might try to post it on ""Data is Beautiful"", or a colleague who is doing most of his visualizations is always saying that they are not ready. So maybe in future iterations, they will finally be ready to be posted there. I just wanted to answer also, the question of Kasha.

**Audience comment:**  
*Just a question based on training on sentiment. And second that you employed any kind of benchmark for sentiment analysis algorithms?*

**Michal:**  
Okay, so answering the question about a DA <?>. We have used this algorithm for topic modelling on this news data set. And again on a data set of introductions to all of the repositories on GitHub. In the first case, the articles were longer. And because the introductions are basically two or three sentences, in the case of articles, the texts were much longer. And it was used as a tool for summing up the main topics in the news. We often use topic modelling, because it's a nice tool for identifying Latin, Latin topics in the data sets we analyze. So it's for the first step of the analysis, right? So just to summarize a corpus of texts, all the codes related to LDA are available on our GitHub. So if you are interested in some technical details, anon1138917760 we do it, anon1138917760 we choose the parameters for this algorithm, or anon1138917760 we, anon1138917760 we compare the results, it's all there. We have a working paper on <unknown> Where we...

**Audience comment:**  
*So it's on website.  And then on trends for trends within define privacy, you also fall into LDA or no? <very hard to make out what is being said>*

**Michal:**  
So, there was one attempt in this analysis to do this topic modelling dynamic

**Audience comment:**  
*to put the trends together where you put the right trends - that big picture of trends.*

**Michal:**  
So, what we have done was something pretty different. What we have done in this time dimension was to see anon1138917760 topic evolves. So, we have used a tool which is called dynamic topic modelling, where we identify topics in the corpus and then see anon1138917760 during our analysis period these topics evolved. So you can see it maybe I will start..

**Kristof:**
For for this section of the analysis, we mostly use topic modelling Just to give us context, and then we started to use this dynamic topic modelling, which enables us to see also changes in topics, anon1138917760 the frequency of the probability of different words changed in a given topic. So, for example, here, you can see topic one, this appeared as a big topic, collecting the articles on COVID-19. And here it is, the thing that you can see is that anon1138917760 the difference which are the interesting words that had a big change in their probability over time, so, this is our first experiment with dynamic topic modelling. In this example, what has been interesting for us is to see, for example, this change in in in different geographic names, so, New York appear from the end of March in this topic, but previously it has been not present So it suggests as the news stories about COVID-19 and New York, appeared just at the end of March. And on the other hand, China had this strong presence in January, and they gradually decreased. So you can see these kinds of dynamics within a topic. Coming back to your question. If we use the LDA to identify trends, then at this stage, we focused on the buying. So the stuff that's happening in the bubbles at the beginning of the presentation that's based on these time-frequency analyses and regression analyses, and we didn't use LDA, for an automatic generation of trends, but we often think about it and if you do find a way to do that, I'm sure that we'll report on it. And when it comes to the question, I think we all we have just one question related to sentiment analysis. 

**Audience comment:**  
*Is there any kind of benchmark for sentiment analysis as part of your project?*

**Kristof:**  
So here We use sentiment tool called Vader. And it is based on training on social media and mostly for shorter snippets of text. And this has been the tool that we have been using.

**Michal:**  
is a dictionary-based tool, a lexicon-based tool where all the words are given sentiment, right?

**Host:**  
Because you asked a question, and then we started to go there, but we didn't really go there.

**Michal:**  
It's a good one. This question about the comparison between, let's say, 2008. And today's situation, right? What we could do about it, what's referred to anon2298377336 often is this hype cycle when it comes to technologies, right, this Gartner hype curve, and maybe there is something with such disasters or uncommon races like pandemics or financial crisis, that can be represented in some sort of curve right? So what we could do as we are not field experts. So we are not psychologists, but we are data scientists. So what we could do is to compare these curves. We could do some econometrics and time series analysis to compare trends in, let's say, this anxiety separated. This is something would be interesting for us to check out. I think it would be also interesting to cooperate with some psychologists and think more about this the future.

**Host:**  
Did you map the depression part going back to 2008 too? I thought it was curious that anxiety would go up but in which I would expect but depression went down. That I didn't really get.

**Michal:**  
This is interesting. And what we thought is that maybe it's the case that I guess what we are observing is ability <?>n, not actual symptoms, or patients, but rather narratives or discourse about mental health. So it might be the case that during such events, you are expressing more active problems and you are more agitated. Or let's say you are not expressing symptoms of depression on social media, maybe after being you know, quarantined for a while, you start to start doing it again. But in the beginning, it's more about anxiety, right,d about something unexpected. It's my take on it as a layman in psychology. But what data says is what we present here, and it's a sharp increase in comments and posts about anxiety and an interesting decrease in posts and comments in the subreddit about depression.

**Host:**  
I think that also connects to this question of anon1138917760 then research questions formulated or addressed with this type of research. How would this data set that comes together, then come together with, for example, the psychologist or the researcher who then formulate the research question.

**Audience comment:**  
*Yes, exactly. How do you communicate your research to different fields? That is important.*

**Michal:**  
That's a tricky question for us. We are in this good position that in the lab, we are an interdisciplinary team of researchers. So we work daily basis with lawyers and people from the sociology department, mostly. And we have some discussions where we try to communicate our results to them, and they make use of this data. But we are really open to cooperating with all social scientists and scientists on it. If you have any ideas and or suggestions on anon1138917760 we can do it better please go on.

**Audience comment:**  
*I'm not I don't have any suggested sorry. I was just curious. But thank you for circling back to my question.* 

**Audience comment:**  
*I would like to propose something, Tt may be a bit crazy, but following up on what Kasha said, I like this idea of the hybrid technique in which you would have some kind of domain expert, helping to channel the mass of data. And along those lines, I wonder if we could kind of dream up a methodology that looks like this: you get a bunch of domain experts to produce some kind of statement, think of it as a focus group. And they will say something like, and I'm quoting the one we had on surveillance pandemic, about a month ago, they will say something like, ""policymakers tend to overestimate the effectiveness of technology-based surveillance vis a vis the pandemic."" Now, once you have a statement like this, which is exaggerated with respect to the data, then maybe you can use the data to find echoes of it in the data source. So in this case, you would be looking for something like, ""everybody agrees everybody in the know, expert, the community agrees with x, where x is the statement. And so in this case, the way we work is an example of solutionism, you would find a bunch of solutions words solution effective efficient, real-time scalable algorithmic stuff like that. Then see if this kind of language trends, even though we have a problem of the null, the counterfactual. Does it trend more than average of whatever analysis, then see if it co-occurs with epidemics language. You will build another vector of epidemics word - COVID Coronavirus pandemic whatever. And if it co-occurs with tech solutions to the pandemic, like contact tracing app, link and sees if it co-occurs with things like dodgy surveillance companies that will also mention the same focus group as treating versus abusing opportunity, Palantir, etc. If sentiment is negative if all of this occurs, it means that there is an association between solutionist language and pandemic, there is one. And it is looked upon with scepticism or with these negative sentiment by the community for whatever values of a community. And in that case, you could say, well, we dreamed up this thing in a focus group, but actually looks like it's in line with what is coming out of the data. So there will be a sort of fairly complete method in the sense that at least it triangulates a theme otherwise you're always left with this kind of anomalies, but it's very hard to interpret. Is that possible to do?*

**Kristof:**
Yes, maybe not in its glory was way that you described, but for sure it is necessary. So when it comes to the analysis of word combinations, or sentiments, or even trending terms, it is very important to have a feedback if it actually makes sense on the one hand, and on the other hand to reach areas we should go deeper.  When we are working on these kinds of analyses, then we are always selecting certain areas to prepare some deep dives some case studies similarly as in this presentation and to have these kinds of meetings where we are together with experts from different fields and they are drawing our attention to certain areas. This is very useful for us because then just as you mentioned, we can, for example, look into this kind of word combinations and check back in our data if the general consensus in tech journalism someanon1138917760 corresponds to their opinion.

**Audience comment:**  
*Yeah, so, in that case, you would have an exogenously generated list of words and that is what makes the whole model kind of clench into action because now you're not pulling stuff out of whatever you actually know what you're looking for, because somebody else is externally validating that those are relevant words. And that we could kind of maybe try and do with this particular, call it to focus group, but we could do others. And by the way, practical reasons we couldn't record encode the text of the code, but if we could have, which we will in the future, then we would have precise words and group of words that you could simply just feed to your algorithm and see what comes out of it. Like the exact words that people use this to describe the problem at hand. This will get a fix someanon1138917760 and the problem I feel.*

**Kristof:**  
so we had one in the project before our results were presented at the workshop for an expert group. The workshop was organized by Argus University, so by our team members, and actually the process was that we suggested a bunch of trending topics on the project website. And they sanon1138917760 the presentation to the experts, who then had a great discussion if actually, our suggestion that, for example, different economic aspects of the technology should be devoted greater research into words such as platform competition, or privacy, this kind of stuff. So they vetted our suggested topics are also the most relevant to them. And there was some agreement. There were also some disagreements, and in the end, we prepared a best-off list of trending stuff that are trending according to the data and the title events are also according to the experts. So please do we do such workshops It was very useful.

**Host:**  
I didn't see the word equality or inequality coming up, and at least from where I sit this pandemic and inequality and now, I mean I realize the broad term, but at least it's super relevant for us over here: racism. In other words, are the handling of immigrants or outsiders, these things cannot be separated. You can't solve any one of them without the others. Maybe that would come up now, whereas it didn't so much before.

**Michal:**  
I have just checked and till the end of May, the word inequality was not trending in technological news, either was racism. It's interesting to be the case when we iterate again, or analysis and do the update the results because I agree that, especially when we choose U.S. sources might be the case that these issues will be really interrelated.

**Host:**  
Do you know anon1138917760 Reddit is distributed geographically? Does anybody know that? I mean, is it dominated by American comments now?

**Michal:**  
So it depends on the subreddit. But what we want to do is to choose major subreddits of all EU countries and analyze the data.

**Kristof:**  
So when it comes to like this inequality aspect, then maybe we didn't pick up the word inequality itself. But we find such words that are socially relevant as for example, stockpiling or furlough, this whole area related to unemployment, I remember we also had anon2298377336 a lot of results on the gig economy. So that press is also covering in an increased manner, this relationship between technology and social issues. I think we also need to check vulnerability and justice Alberto is suggesting.

**Host:**  
I was curious as important as what the information that is in the graph, that is also anon1138917760 you introduce and anon1138917760 you present background information, things like The Reddit that we are drawing this from started in this year or at this point a riot started which changed the meaning of that word or if something like GitHub is used less in China due to the different product being used, and therefore things that would influence that data. And there is a myriad also things and I just imagined that it is very hard to figure out the right balance of anon1138917760 to write a legend so it presents all the background information that you need to properly understand and not misunderstand trends that you see in a graph. But also, to have that in a way that people will still read it at all because if you put all of it in a) nobody reads it b) it's just like you have to draw a line somewhere to have something to say.

**Kristof:**
So Reddit to data is is a great challenge in this aspect because, in the case of news articles, you have a relatively clean data, which is worse structure <?> than when the context is relatively straightforward, but in the case of Reddit is a much more complex data source before these different shades and additional context that you mentioned. So to find the right way to analyze the data, definitely, some insights from social scientists are necessary to really dive into the discussion on Reddit in a way that is representative for the communities over there. We had some struggles finding the right ways to analyze this data. And thank you very much for all the suggestions for the things to be checked because it will help us to design the research for next iterations. 

**Michal:**
That is a tough one balancing presenting everything from events but not overflowing our users or our audience. This is something we are struggling with. And recently we focused on our team on creating tutorials to our analysis. So when you have basic knowledge of data science, you can use our GitLab code and seek for growing keywords you can seek for hidden topics in this data sets for yourself and calculate everything we have done so far but using different hypothesis or research questions. I know that there is still this difficulty because you still got to know the basics of Python. But at the moment, we cannot do anything about it.

**Host:**
Are you documenting those weights like anon1138917760 people interpret and use it in different ways?

**Audience Comment**  
*Yes, this was focused on recent works. We hope that is understandable right now. You can check for yourself and check our tutorials. We have put a lot of effort so that they are visible. Maybe in the future, we can do it even you know, for people I don't use Python, I guess we can create some interface for users just to type in some keywords, and there would be the results of our analysis. Maybe in the future.*

**Host:**  
You looked at the news, the press, and you looked at Reddit, I'm curious, did you analyze what the news said and then analyze what Reddit said, to see if they matched up much? In other words, let's say that Reddit is an example of ""the people.""  And then you get the press. Is there alignment as to what they're talking about? Or is there a bit of a mismatch?

**Michal:**  
This is something we want to do, or I guess, two or three years to compare the sources, but we don't still don't have a good methodology for that. What we had done previously was just to compare the discourse about certain things on Reddit and in news, so see what is the vocabulary used around certain topics. And we found that, for example, when you use Reddit, this discourse is really, really different as narratives in media. The vocabulary is ""mediatized"", right? And you can find very interesting keywords when you project our angles on viewing some issues related to technology when you analyze Reddit. But it's very difficult to compare them, let's say on one axis. Alberto already mentioned the problem with this null model or baselines and we had this problem in case of single sources, but when you want to compare across sources, the problem is even bigger. Right now, what we will focus on probably is creating baselines in all sources, in all single sources. So for example, there was this question about anon1138917760 we measured this growth against all the comments in the source. So this is something we will work in the future. If you know any good methodologies where people convert social media with news, we are happy to look at them. But we didn't find any good right now.

**Kristof:**
Nothing similar. 

**Michal:**
We wanted to do with research papers. To see whether there is one source that is ahead of the other. So is it the case that researchers are taking ideas from popular media or is it the other way around or is it different across disciplines? This is something easier to do, I guess. But social media is so dynamic that it's difficult to compare with the news.

**Audience comment:**  
*But is it difficult because of the manpower or lack thereof or is it difficult because of the lack of proper methodology?*

**Audience comment:** 
*The second thing - it is the second problem. We don't have any good idea on anon1138917760 to normalize this data.* 

**Kristof:**
In the case of news, we can always take into account the number of articles or some other things to normalize. In the case of Reddit, it is challenging to find this single value that we can attach a certain topic or certain words. So, definitely, it needs a well-prepared methodology to see these kinds of comparisons.

**Audience comment:**  
*The null model problem is the bane of data science, you know, this kind of keeps coming up in all sorts of problems, maybe because we tend to under theorize and so of course, you have this kind of regularities. But in a case like this, I would probably try to go down the collective intelligence path. So instead of looking too much around, like trying to identify in authoritative, but large enough data source, so imagine you're talking about information, security or say, Okay, I'm gonna just focus on the Chaos Computer Club. So what those guys say goes, because they are the crowd that knows this stuff. And then you would focus on there, whatever their online watering holes are and just ignore everything else. Because also you can be super polluted.  The media, you know, vehicle by hype cycles, you get a lot of garbage in and then you will get some kind of garbage out. So maybe instead of big data, it becomes a more hybrid methodology, which is a quantitative validation of expert opinion that will be already. It means that most experts agree, even if you're trying to do policy I used to work for government myself, if you can tell your minister look, yes, there are a few outliers, outliers but by and large, this is what people are saying that is valuable to them.*

**Michal:**  
Yes, such a hybrid method is something we are aiming at. We see ourselves as a foundation for such a discussion, not with the solution, but just to provide some basic info for further investigation.

**Host:**  
I was also wondering, you also before, described anon1138917760 you're opening this up to people to use your code, anon1138917760 you want to open it up to more people to use it, who can't use Python and such. And I think this also leads to what due diligence .connects back to anon1138917760 do you write the right legends to what thing. And do you need to do at which point if when you share your data with people in your own field, then you have a certain baseline already but you know, what they know about they know to ask for anon1138917760 is this to look for certain background information may be on their own, the more we are opening up those things, the more people then take that differently, maybe? But at the same time, you also need to make this accessible to people. So anon1138917760 do you balance out this opening up data across disciplines in a larger context? And who is responsible when for anon1138917760 stuff is then taken and read, like, when a journalist takes a graph that was there for two researchers to talk about, and it's not now finished 100%. But it's just the start of a conversation. But now, the journalist takes it and puts it into a different forum, that changes the content of that, anon1138917760 do we deal with something like that?

**Kristof:**  
This is a great question because that's like a big problem or big challenge for the entire academia now, like anon1138917760 to communicate results in a way that you have social resonance. And anon1138917760 do you prepare and present your results for different stakeholders and I don't think that we have an ultimate solution for that because ourselves are struggling when it comes to this presentation but also in our different research fields. So Michal is working on privacy research, which is rather complicated and, and but is relevant for the society. I'm doing a different empirical search on Airbnb and sometimes I have this kind of conversation with journalists. Often the problem is that you have very nuanced results with different aspects to it. And then it gets very oversimplified or there's a huge overstatement of the results are taken to the extreme, and that's a big challenge. So what we try to do is to filter down our analysis as much as possible. So even if the presentation that we have sanon1138917760n you contains, like, lots of aspects, very different data sources, we really frame this to the best way we could because we tried to find some narratives that that can be sanon1138917760n and that is not that confusing. But what we also try to do is to prepare some blog posts where we provide greater detail of the methodology than in a short presentation. So we try to make different versions for different communities, different observers of our results.

**Audience comment:**  
*as an X researcher, as an astronomer, and as a teacher now, I would like to tell you that there is a great space for communicating science, but you need people for this. I mean, we have these places that are called science centres, or science museums where you can do your science hands-on, but it mostly boils down to physics, biology, maybe chemistry, but it's very difficult to do Museum of Science for research that you do. So you need some kind of intermediate person who is going to understand your science deeply enough. And then is going to speak, so to speak a common language to communicate that science to the public. So it's very nice that you're trying to model your output. So different groups can understand it. But frankly speaking, I don't think this is your job. Your job as a researcher is to produce science. You need another person to understand that science and then speak up for you. And for your research. That would be great. But if you have any ideas, anon1138917760 to anon1138917760 to put science into the science museums, that would be even better, then everyone can see I think this is great media for that great outlook.*

**Host:**  
Yeah, that's a great point. And I think even if you ask those questions here, it is not that you are then the one responsible here, but as you said, somebody needs to be responsible for anon1138917760 and where is it communicated and presented. So maybe I'm also interested in everybody's opinion here, on where those things critical questions should be addressed. And where responsibilities lie. Some of them lie with researchers. But not all of them can. It's a multi-layered community and society where responsibilities lie on different levels.

**Host:**  
We are now at the end of our appointed timeframe for this discussion. This was really interesting. And I want to thank everybody.

**Kristof:**  
Thank you all. Thank you very much for all the questions and helpful comments. It has been a great pleasure for us to come and see you and talk about the results because I think we have spent a relatively large amount of time on doing research, but less on communicating the results as we would have wished. So we are very grateful for this opportunity. And please do get in touch with us in case of further questions. You can find our contact information on the DE Lab website, D lab UW. We are also on Twitter. And meet also on the Edgeryder Platform to bring the conversation further.

**Michal:**  
Exactly. Thank you very much, guys."

Considering that the much of Internet infrastructure is built on free software and open source technologies, it makes me wonder ""What if we would organize the infrastructure development of the Internet in a similar manner?"". To do this by gathering companies, government, civil society and have open and collaborative processes in order to include a multitude of perspectives of this complex issue and overcome the challenges causing devastating consequences for societies, organizations and humans. 

I do not know of any projects working on the organising of society in relation to the internet, only W3C and IETF working on technical collaboration and standardization. My interest in this is mainly in connection to the recent developments and consequences from the Internet that people can experience in their daily offline life or when surfing the World Wide Web.

Specific events I'm thinking about are examples such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal with Facebook and anon1138917760 similar events have happened. These are having a big effect on societies and democratic processes, at least in the representative democratic processes such as election. In that sense we are experiencing consequences of an Internet that is continuously being developed but we do not know anon1138917760, when it is done, it's simply having an impact on us as human beings, with potential large scale negative consequences.

The consequences can mostly be loosely drawn as humans and scientific research can't really keep up with the silo-based, non-coordinated nature and speed of development, making it harder to connect the dots between source of change and consequences. 

My hopes are that we can gather a group of organizations and individuals from different sectors of society who are willing to collaborate and take a more holistic approach, a systems thinking approach on building a Internet infrastructure which serves humans and society as a whole. 

Perhaps establishing an ongoing collaboration with experimentation and action for the development of Internet with discussions and analysis happening when the group designs and reflects on experiments that are to be tested or have been tested. 

These thoughts and my background leading up to this is mainly based on my experience as a human. In this information society it becomes more evident and feels like a lot of actors are acting independantly and unknowing, or not caring, of the different directions they are pulling toward, and the consequences which come from everybody trying to pull in different directions. It gets easy to create a sensation of chaos. 

I believe that this goes for a majority of challenges we are facing, climate, mental health, economy. It's basically the Wild West whereas I believe that many expressions we can see on the Internet are symptoms of this experience for many people. 

I think that with the current information overload many people have, that can really pacify a lot of us. 

I think we're at an interesting point in this time in which these big challenges are becoming more and more transparent, evident and tangible. We need to take a new approach in order to sanon1138917760 that we can overcome these challenges, prove that a new approach can be done and then overcome all of these in parallel. 

I strongly believe that this is more of a challenge of anon1138917760 we organize the work with these common challenges as a society rather than finding one or many technological solutions to all of it. Technological solutions solve technological challenges.

Possibly we will be looking to create something based on the [Valueflows](https://valueflo.ws) vocabulary / [REA](https://msu.edu/user/mccarth4/McCarthy.pdf) to enable new flows of value within the food system. 

Holochain provides a few key features which, combined with open standards and protocols, could prove to be a really strong setup:

* P2P application platform - no middle men

* Single sign on and verified identities while retaining anonymity and data ownership - facilitates trust between parties 

* Built for component reuse - enabling remixing of functionality between applications and easy integrations

* Fully encrypted if needed

* Distributed hash tables without the performance bottlenecks of cryptocurrencies - no need to maintain a global state

* No need to maintain global state means.. resilience - your subnet gets disconnected from the internet and your application keeps running

* Built for performance - no global state and no middle men means no maximum number of transactions. (same as for any of the old open protocols - what is the maximum number of transactions per minute for `http` or `smtp` world wide?)

* Built for limitless microtransactions without fees

.. and probably some other stuff I forgot just now.."

My entry to [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) came from a long quest of trying to figure out why we (in the corporate mindset I had been trained) spend so much time on things that do not make peoples (and the planets) life better which to me is a lot of what I hear in your critique @anon3840432354x. 

So after having spent years looking into the control schematics of money I was out there campaigning for publicly created non-debt money when I came across the [Metacurrency](http://metacurrency.org/) project that pointed out that money was a very poor signalling system that is extremely lossy of information. 

What the Metacurrency project suggested, of which Holochain is a part, was that we needed a new way to individually creating the expressions that we need to better make visible what has happened (money says very anon2726675500 about what actually happened) and our desires for future things to happen. And we need to be able to weave all these expressions, like I am now weaving the words that I have learnt, to make new meaning.

So, this was a long winded way of motivating why I am very excited by Holochain for creating a human internet. Not because it couldn't be done by other people, other protocols or in another way, but because the driving force behind the project is fully set on transcending the scarce reality of the monetary environment. Turning a world of transactions into a world of interconnected flows and people. 

Sure enough Holochain is not THE framework for EVERYTHING. Lots of applications require different tech but at its core it is, in my view, deeply human and respectful of human integrity in the way it allows for you storing your data until you decide you want to share something with someone, just like you do with your everyday experience as well as enabling as few as two people to start using a new app together with no involvement of things like servers.

Agent-centrism also allows for these applications not only to bridge between each other, but to many other systems where you allow the application to act on your behalf. Integration with things like [SSB](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) which is already creating a much more human experience should be easy enough given that they are both offline first, cryptographically signed information exchanges. 

As for actual use right now, in addition to what me and @anon4233812254 [built](https://github.com/anon4233812254lund/holochain-logistics) I have one more application [prototyped](https://github.com/anon111067376/MailBoox-rust) and a few more designed, but there is still a lot of changes going on in the [core framework](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust) so things are breaking a lot. A few more months until apps see daily use I am guessing. 

Anyway, sorry for ranting, but the efforts for open-source ""_organizing the work with these common challenges as a society_"" are very much front and center in the Holochain/Metacurrency community as far as I can tell."

Oh, money is a very poor system for a multitude of reasons :) For one thing, state currencies try to be both a means of exchange and a store of value, and these two monetary functions are in conflict. And there is the more fundamental reason that money as a ""token of value accepted by a multitude of parties"" is inherently a social construction and needs social governance to be successful, and that often fails, both in states and in grassroots projects.

So what we did to support economic exchange in [PayCoupons](https://pay.coupons) is to switch from money to mutual credit notes. In a way, everyone there issues their own currency and we solve the problem of ""but anon1138917760 does everyone get what they want"" with an algorithm for multi-party bartering that we made.

I remember we looked into Holochain, Bancor, Stanon204016368r etc. but so far, there is just no distributed ledger technology that could run PayCoupons in a privacy-protecting way. The mathematics for running our algorithm in that manner are just not there yet. So we have to stick with a centralized or federated platform architecture for now (and it sanon1138917760s that distributed ledgers have some limitations left, but it will be figured out).

When it comes to actual use of any new value accounting or exchange system, the experience we made is this: it's a challenge to hide away all the tech complexity from the end user, but without that there will be no mainstream adoption."

I'd love to hear what the privacy-protection needs that you have are? 

I agree that especially all of the blockchain stuff I have seen is super unaccessible for anyone non-technical. Hoping that the key management parts of Holochain will help make it much easier to hide that stuff.

Transactions on distributed ledgers are public and pseudonymous, and would sanon1138917760 the ""zero-sum mutual credit exchange transactions"" that we calculate for our users. With that information and a few user accounts taking part in the transactions (de-anonymizing a few trade partners which is still ok) one can then apply network analysis techniques and de-anonymize everyone's identity.

We're building the system for businesses though, and they would not be happy to see that all their trade partners, orders and order volumes are exposed publicly :| The only way to solve this would be to run mathematical optimization in a distributed way over a network, with each node having only limited knowledge about their own orders. But that's _wayyy_ too slow. So we have to wait for functional encryption and the like to become more mature so that we can do the same but on a single machine."

Similar to the underlying capitalistic mentality shaping solutions through their development as brought up by John, I want to mention the general problem of scaling at this point.

It's hard for me to say much about the character of Holochain-based software since it's all still very experimental. There are no production-level apps and I don't know anon1138917760 well it is all going to turn out, but in theory and prototyping it is looking fascinating. 

I think that there is a possibility of not needing to scale as much with self-hosting. Especially if we can bridge all of the different applications through the person using them. If it is as easy to create an application (or at least instance of an application) for three people as it is for 10 000 people then anon1138917760 large a scale would we need? 

One aim with Holochain is to have small packets of composable code that can be used to create the local applications that are needed within a community. While there are probably going to be applications that span actors from all over the world, including knowledge sharing and bridge-building applications between networks, there is a possibility for an approach to network building that promotes smaller, evolvable applications that are run by a bunch of people that want to coordinate activities. Is there really a need for global scale applications? The one network? If not, what is the appropriate scale of a network? 

I am guessing that people will be bridging different networks and applications in the area of their interest and expertise. I don't really have a clear picture of all this yet, but I don't think we'll see these 4 billion people applications like FB. Maybe not even 4 million people applications. More like a multitude of interconnected 400 people (or 40 people) applications. Many people may have similar applications but they could all be running slightly different versions and tweaked interfaces, at least that is the promise of the infrastructure as far as I understand it. We could hope that this would lead to more self-steering, self-directed and self-informed groups, but I guess time will tell if that actually comes to fruition."

I would be very keen to hear more about your view on anon1138917760 SSB and Holochain would be combinable?

I'm also curious to hear more about what holochains relation to monetary structures embedded within the applications. Would currency be a possible integration in the core protocol of Holochain? Would it be in the application layer? 

In general I'm curious as to Holochains relation to monetary-issues :cherry_blossom:"
20,53503,2019-05-14T21:15:46.397Z,9766,1,26,25,2,0,0,110.2,53497,anon111067376,anon215618117,"Well as both SSB and Holochain are frameworks that store information locally, author (and cryptografically sign) and gossip what you as an agent signal (post) into the systems, it seems to me that building bridging applications would be relatively straight forward. You could have an application, lets call it SimplePost, that is able to cross post (through your cryptographic signatures) both into the SSB blob and some Holochain local chain and DHT. 

You could also authorize an SSB application to request data from say your Holochain contact book by simply opening the ""API"" of the Holochain application to allow it (authorizing the keys of the application requesting). I write API in quotations since, in my understanding, good Holochain design is based on separating the UIs and data layer of all the Holochain applications so that we can create UIs that utilize many different DHTs for richer applications. Through that design, all data function calls are effectively APIs and just as accessible from, for instance, an SSB application as from a simple localhost webapp (using things like websockets).

As for currencies and Holochain that is a bit of a rabbit hole. This whole thing grew out of the meta-currency project and there is some pretty deep and heady [material](http://metacurrency.org/portfolio-item/deep-wealth-a-post-monetary-jazz-ensemble/) on what Holochain is trying to enable in this space. 

But as a short reply, yes, one of the reasons why Holochain has focused so much energy on creating peer-validating functions and temper-proofing local chains of entries is that it sets the stage for super simple implementation of currency. 

Currencies on Holochain would not require tokens or mining but are a way of issuing credit to one another which is then a circulating supply. This can be done within applications, but are possibly better thought of as micro-services usable by any application you have installed. Currency is a simple app. And as all other apps, the UI could weave it into another app. 

Say for instance a carsharing application. The application that is keeping track of car usage and maintenance costs can call into the carpool credit application and shift credit from one user to another. Maybe the carpool credit application can also be the tool library credit application, all that requires is using it in both apps.

I don't know if that makes things clearer @anon215618117, if not, please help me clarify where I am confusing, I'm happy to exercise and grow my understanding like that. :smile:"

@anon2516847305 Definitely. Maybe the narratives around these issues such as the planet's ecosystems health and overall system health are erasing the motivation when the narratives need to enable people's will? Regarding the driverelss car-narrative I believe big reason to the belief in this is that it has strong compelling arguments for investors and politicians interested in growth and maintaining current mainstream policies connected to measurements like GDP. This is simply because it requires to build new (electric) superior cars/vehicles (for few individuals), infrastructure, support and maintenance systems as well as auanon3386180186omy systems which is more attractive than the more financially cost-heavy investments of big transit system which are less flexible, more capital intensive and has less revenue per person (one car/person vs one train or hyperloop/many people).

Though not being a lawyer, I can judge this case from my (living in EU) perspective, also thanks to being a MyData Founding Member². There are some differences in EU vs. US copyright laws, also in the law systems (continental vs. case law). But 'FAIR use' is almost similar in both, and it can be defended in court. For (at least) FOUR DIFFERENT 'fair use' cases: 
(1) books in Accessible Formats, for Visually Impaired People VIP 
(2) for PRIVATE USE 
(3) for force-majeur circumstances, like IA did (when pandemia closed public library (PL) services. Some legal opinions here¹) 
(4) as a human right case.

FAIR use cases may look different in national legislatures, e.g. U.S. vs. Italian vs. Finnish; in U.S. there's 'exhaustion' of copyright³ (first-sale doctrine) when a book is legally owned, e.g. by buying it or via donation, ""forgotten"" by Alexander (who inaccurately⁴ referred to Copyright law), quoted By TechRepublic⁵. See very good comments in the IA blog⁶ re. societal effects.

But I play safe (Case I), even though I'd like to defend these cases in court: I'll start my service **for Visually Impaired People** (VIP) ONLY, by leveraging The Marrakesh Treaty for VIP (U.S. is also a party, that signed the Treaty): it provides for right to copy (incl. right to order & to receive copy) - of copyrighted books without asking permission from a copyright owner.

In EU nation countries we have a paragraph in Copyright laws: right to make copIES for PRIVATE USE (⁷Art. 12). Up to four copies⁸, by Finnish law, for family members AND closest FRIENDS (Case II).

My plan: to start service #MyData #IndiviDUALbooks (Bœks) 
- with 'fair use case I', for VIP only; 
- then to implement 'fair use case II', for PRIVATE uses, in Finland - to EU - to U.S. (maybe). I discussed it with libraries/lawyers in Finland: THOUGH IT'S A LEGAL RIGHT, NO-ONE WISHES TO RISK A LEGAL BATTLE. So, I may use 'a trick': data cooperatives¹² instead of PL.
- 'fair use case III', for data cooperatives, see below¹²,  in Finland - to EU - to U.S. (maybe)
-  'fair use case IV', as-a-human-right, for force-majeur (pandemia), where applicable. 

Cases III/IV - IF SUPPORTED by strong communities (like Edgeryders/ MyData).

I like what IA did, but with all my due respect, I don't (yet) have resources to fight in court  against publisher monsters. I can only try to explain them that they lose more than gain, if opposing Bœks (like in above Dutch-like* use cases).
Also like against Amazon's business model killing local businesses: my idea is here⁹.

The Accessible Formats of books, provided by Bœks innovation - is even an OBLIGATION for public services, by Accessibility laws. Though not enforceable yet, similar to GDPR's Article 20 (data portability). Nevertheless, I promote the Accessibility AND cost-efficiency of the Bœks.

The U.S. Copyright Office¹º stated that ""[t]he tangible nature of a copy is a defining element of the first sale doctrine and critical to its rationale.""¹¹ Therefore, when DATA is not rival, a right to enjoy the PERSONAL DATA assets don't need to be protected in courts (like the threat to IA). It is a HUMAN RIGHT, like the right-to-internet in Finnish law, or the First Amendment in U.S. law. This is a long topic, but there's a good paper, that I plan to leverage for my next level ('fair use case III') in implementation my Bœks, as-'The Bœks for The Web': ‘property-owning democracy’ through personal data platform cooperatives'¹².
I consider Bœks a TRANSFORMATIVE use case, it's a ground for asserting Bœks as FAIR use case: as we apply access to PERSONAL DATA assets into a PL book form-factor: MyData Label-Butanon3386180186 approach / MyData Operators best practices access in1click at The Butanon3386180186,
- for PERSONAL benefits, non-accessible without TRANSFORMATION into Bœks. 

Re. 'the exclusive right of reproduction' vs. 'right to copy' (⁷""exclusive right to control
a work by reproducing it **AND** by making it available to the public"", Section 2).

Quote from EFF: ""That (CDL program) means that if the Archive and its partner libraries have only one copy of a book, then only one patron can borrow it at a time, just like any other library."" 
My Bœk solution has three sub-solutions:
(1) is similar to CDL, but in a PHYSICAL / PAPER form. It is (to be) supported by the novelty of Finnish law: royalty is paid to copyright owners when a book is loaned by a PL, also for e-books. A Bœk, when (a scan file is) sent to be printed, signals 'a loan event' to the relevant Finnish authority (state fund Sanasto), that provides royalty payments, for VIP
- or even if a book is 'loaned' (a forthcoming, anon1896561845-to-anon1896561845, loan of a Bœk, received from a PL) by a natural person, i.e. not by a PL, but leveraging the PL's data / resources. Thus protecting copyright holders' economical interests / leaving them off the argument ""IA's NEL is vile""¹³.
(2) When a physical book owner uses his/her right to produce & share a (legally obtained) Bœk copy in a paper form (or CDL-like e-book, INSIDE a Bœk's DUAL form-factor; it's like CDL from IA) FOR PRIVATE USE (a fair use case, for e.g. family member). 
This case differs from (1), as a PL patron / a data cooperative member utilizes FOR FREE the Bœk printers, owned by PL / or by the data cooperative (like MyData Coop). 
2 € eco-deposit applies though, like a deposit in a sale price for a plastic bottle; 
(3) 10+2=12 € deposit applies, if a PL patron 'purchases' / prints himself/herself a Bœk, non-available commercially/from PL, via a PL database resources. This includes author royalty.
Case (3) differs 
- from case (1), by SEAMLESSNESS of non-availability of a book in case 1, for non-VIPeople, i.e. a patron must fulfill the request to share a Bœk (by postal service) - if such happens; 
- from case (2), by economical constraints: if a patron prints for ownership (i.e. not shares) more than one Bœk per year.

Hello people,

I was drawn to this conversation by way on Open Calls on the NGI.eu platform where I saw a link to https://edgeryders.eu/t/is-the-communitarian-internet-back-in-the-wake-of-covid-19-a-conversation-with-anon1138917760ard-rheingold/12971. I was curious, as I know @anon1138917760ard_rheingold in person, and was happily surprised to see this is a Discourse site running! 

[quote=""anon
What is a burning question that drives your work?
[/quote]

I don't reason in terms of a single question to drive my work, let alone it be a _burning_ question. If I would, I guess it would go something like: **given the current trends in energy consumption, what must we do to prevent the extinction of complex life on Earth and shift -- if at all possible -- to a way of life that makes us humans part of the global organism we call our planet?**

[quote=""anon
How did you get started and what hurdles have you met along the way?
[/quote]

I was born, which is anon1138917760 we all get started. Then someday I hit a keyboard, sent an email, got response. It changed my life as I realized the Internet could be a life-changing phenomenon. In the last five years though, I tend to consider high-tech as more of a burden than a liberating mean, as too many critical people are not (going to be) using it, especially peasants, who are about the only people who can save us from the greed of obsolete economic and political theories. But I digress -- or not: maybe this the biggest hurdle I've met along the way, maybe it is really ; that _people in charge_ try to follow a normative model that does no-one any good, including themselves. I was lucky enough to spend some quality time -- although not enough -- with @anon1138917760ard_rheingold and what I learned from him is that brilliance requires a lot of compassion and love for life -- but not _Life_ in an abstract sense, but _incarnate life_, with strong presence to oneself and the others around you ; and this is not something that can find any technological solution. I bet if people were happier about their life on Earth, we'd be living with much less, in much better conditions. But... 

[quote=""anon
Which doubts do you have about the work you are doing and the path forward?
[/quote]

Like everyone else I guess, I must compose with forces going in other directions. My biggest doubt, especially with the COVID-19 crisis, is that people may not be capable of getting rid of their over-costly habits -- when I hear that we should be ""catching up with what we 'missed' from being confined"" and that would be more energy consumption, more competition, more production, I have serious doubts we can make it.

[quote=""anon
What kind of support would you like to offer others traveling a similar path?
[/quote]

Never give up. If it seems impossible, it's probably because you're looking at it from, or ""through _unearthly_ angles"". Reality is entangled, and there _is_ ""spooky action at a distance"". What you see, is not what you get. And in @anon1138917760ard_rheingold's words: 

[quote=""anon1138917760ard_rheingold, post:4, topic:12971""]
what it is —> is —>up to us
[/quote]

### So, why this topic's name: ""Towards a Public Digital Infrastructure""? 

Well, I was eating from the trash, living in a squat, hacking away. And I met many other people in the same case, hacking on free software, privacy-enhancing software, software that was being critical to many other people organizing around the world. And every time the same topic was coming back: we lack funds. We're broke. We can't compete against giants... In 2012, a number of people gathered during the Berlin Art Biennial to discuss peer-to-peer Internet systems. Everyone had the same problem. So I started working on it. I met people. I looked around, asked around. In 2017 I founded the Public Universal Base: Libre Infrastructure Community (PUBLIC). We gather like-minded people, we go after funding. One call at a time. And from the dozen projects who were part of the 2012 P2P meeting in Berlin, I'm happy to say that most of them are now funded. Thanks to this cooperative effort of a bunch of people who, behind the scenes, build capacity for the free software community. And NGI has been helpful so far in this direction, but we're light-years away still to shift the paradigm from competition to cooperation, where all our efforts should be going since we do not have much time left to keep our civilization from crashing. The NGI effort is a tiny piece of the huge European construct. As it slowly grows towards acceptance of free software and the Commons, we humans have a chance to shift away from self-destruction.

Thank you for your attention."

I think that economic and racial justice are fully bound to the Covid virus now and can't be separated out.  So added to pre and post covid NGI related questions about identity, surveillance, privacy, climate, working and functioning remotely, IoT and all the so-called smart tech must now be justice in ways that were perhaps given lower priority not too many months ago."

Both the above points were discussed in length in the referenced permaculture book; and this is a clarification/closeout post to an item that was discussed in the session; but not recorded in the minutes.

One of the discussions that was had during the permaculture talk at re:web was the discussion on hedging for climate change; financially. This means having a cover for the impacts, and investing suitably against this by allocating investment decisions accordingly.

*I wasn’t sure about a solution at the time, and was a bit challenged that I hadn't considered this :smile:*

With recent discussions on AMZN and other single stocks on ssb; I was inspired to see if this was already a discussed problem, in keeping with the benefits of diversity afforded by index investing in reducing some of the risks obtained by placing money into public markets.

*note: entertainment use only, do not drive after reading, not investment advice, etc…*

So a quick google I came up to this [swedish 2015 paper](https://www.ap4.se/globalassets/dokument/rapportarkiv/ovriga-rapporterdok/hedging-climate-risk.pdf) on hedging climate risks by excluding the more CO2 intensive companies. By accepting a small tracking error from the parent index, you can achieve significant CO2 reduction on the portfolios economic activities. From the graph below it suggests that it might be possible to reduce the intensity while keeping track of the index, in a similar way that “perfect is the enemy of good“ where you may not get to 100%; but a small change can get you to 50% anon2298377336 easily with not a lot of drama.

](https://schmud.de/posts/2020-06-06-internet-governance.html)

I have mixed feelings on the UN internet governance initiatives, but I do think they can be important for intra-State conflicts. The UN is looking at three different models for coordination among stakeholders:

1. Internet Governance Forum+ (IGF+): this model reflects the current structure of internet governance and the United Nations, with some enhancements.
2. Digital Commons Architecture (DCA): a simplified structure of three bodies, a *tech panel*, a *digital commons platform*, and an *architecture secretariat*, that coordinate through the existing infrastructure at the United Nations.
3. Distributed Co-Governance (CoGov): two bodies, *network support platforms* and *digital cooperation networks* , that coordinate through a network of networks.

I found the DCA a compelling, internet-native model that sacrifices some of the speed of more centralized UN control. I somewhat doubt they will implement the model, but it is one I lobbied for:

Conversely, I'd be curious to know if IGF has done any work on digital currencies outside of state control. I'd also be curious about their efforts in open source in the context of empowering the underprivileged (or from the UN perspective, ""developing nations"").

I have a perhaps helpful reflection that I know I am not the first to have made:

Digitalization and computer systems lend themselves to centralized decisions, and this was the most aggressive charge leveraged against computerization in the 1960s and 1970s. The Skolverket might, for instance, decide to create an application service for high school for 14 year olds to facilitate the administration of applications under the fria skolval. However, what ends up happening is that parents and kids turn to teachers with questions about the interface and application process, in spite of teachers being far away both from the process of designing the interface and not being responsible for the application process either. 

So while for Skolverket the centralized system for applications under the fria skolval is indeed a time-saver that enables efficiency, for the individual teachers it becomes a time-hog since they have to spend time explaining to individual students/parents systems that they are not well-placed to understand or explain. It sub-optimizes by creating an easily measurable ""central"" advantage that translates into a more difficult to measure ""decentral"" disadvantage (see also @anon2674660368 's 4th principle here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/5-new-principles-for-justice-in-the-age-of-ai-and-other-networked-technologies/12117/3 )

This is profound, @anon3099529057 – and thanks to @anon3294784966 for bringing it up (welcome Linnea, sorry for noticing your post so late!). And it seems fundamental, not related to the Internet at all. In [Seeing like a state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State), James Scott has this very interesting observation that administrative ordering tends to overextend. And when it does, someone else gets dumped with the price to pay. The context of this observation is urban planning, and in particular the city of Brasilia, built from the ground up as a high modernist project. What happened there is that the ""rational"" city designed by Niemeyer could not function as a city, because it had no cheap accommodation, no street food, no hangouts etc. And so, promptly, favelas arose, to host the workers that were building the official Brasilia, and to perform the essential services that a city must provide, but that become incredibly difficult to produce under too strict and administrative grid. He puts it this way: the informal city *underwrites* the formal one, just like the teachers underwrite Skolverket's new system for applications."

I have been online since 1992 – hell, I practically *lived* online most of these 30 years. What drew me to the Internet was not the presence of shiny, easy-to-use, free services – they were not there in the early days. On the contrary, you had to put in time and money if you wanted to, as we said then, ""connect to the Internet"". 

But the reward was high. *Whatever your tribe, you would find it*. Whether you cared about particle physics, detective stories or board games, countless like-minded people were waiting for you ""out there"". And yes, you would occasionally encounter conflict and rants, but they would be overwhelmed by the sense of being welcome, of belonging. For me – a bookish, weird kid from an Italian small town, who was into weird music, it was a lifeline. 

But, of course, it was not about me. The sense of community was pervasive, generalized. 

> My direct observations of online behaviour around the world over the past ten years have led me to conclude that whenever computer-mediated communications technology becomes available to people anywhere, they inevitably build virtual communities with it, just as microorganisms inevitably create colonies.

These words were written by @anon1138917760ard_rheingold in 1994, in a seminal book called *[The Virtual Community](https://books.google.be/books?id=fr8bdUDisqAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rheingold+virtual+community&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0_MaQsa7oAhXHMewKHffIBlAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=rheingold%20virtual%20community&f=false)*. In the intervening years, anon1138917760ever, some of that sense of community has been lost. Some American computer networks had been offering commercial services since the late 1980s; in 1992, US Congress pass a law that allowed the academic NSFNET, to connect to those commercial networks, and the latter to use NSFNET as their infrastructural backbone. Seven years later, the dotcom boom sanon1138917760ed everyone the money-making potential of the Internet. The original ""digital settlers"" described by Howard's book were still out there, but increasingly drowned out by corporate types. The idea itself of virtual community gave way to that of social networking service (Facebook and similar), and the communitarian early Internet of the 1990s to the surveillance capitalist one of today. 

Then COVID-19 hit. 

Suddenly, everyone's social media feed is full of bottom-up, self-organized initiatives for mutual aid. Everyone is releasing previously paywalled content, offering help, creating resources and directories. Is the communitarian Internet back? The question is important, because Edgeryders considers itself a virtual community, one of the last of the original, early wave virtual communities. We were born as a response to the previous crisis, the 2008 financial collapse. In the wake of COVID-19, we are mobilizing, just like everybody else ([example](/t/12962), [other example](/t/12886)). But: are we doing enough? Are we making the right moves? 

The right person to ask is obviously Howard himself. He and @anon2516847305 are old friends, so I asked John to ask Howard if he would agree to a video call between the three of us. He did, and just like that we were conversing across an ocean and eight time zones. 

### On coordinating and integrating the community's response

 > Have you guys thought of taking on the work of coordinating between large organizations and this patchwork of initiatives that are popping up in response to COVID-19?
 
@anon1075425386 
 
 > Yes, but we struggle. Everyone is shouting for attention. And what you call greenspaces (nice name, by the way!) seem mostly hyperlocal, ephemeral – they are out there, but I do not see them connecting. No one is keeping track of the big picture.
 
@anon1138917760ard_rheingold:
 
 > Right now, people are super focused on just doing the job. I would suggest to compile a list of things that are happening, putting it online, and then inviting everyone to meet others. Point to something, and tell people ""Look, we can get together and help each other!""

 > I know it sounds difficult. It is. But look: with COVID-19, this is the first time that everyone on Earth is thinking about the same thing. Additionally, everyone is closer to each other because everyone is online. We now see people organizing Zoom calls with their friends.

 > And note this: this is all happening two years into a backlash against ""big tech"", when people – at least here in America – are starting to regard Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook with suspicion and even fear. There is again some space for doing good online. We can take back the Internet! The start of a network, of an online community is very much like what we are doing here, the three of us having a Zoom call. We look at our computer screen, and see people. Hey, it's people! I see their faces!  We are all doing it anyway because of the pandemic, let's maintain this greenspace online, these convivial spaces. Note that some of it is not even on the web, but on the indieweb – spaces like [Scuttlebutt](/t/9802), that run their own protocols.


### On helping folks to bringing work online

Howard thinks the COVID-19 fallout offers an opportunity to rethink the way we collaborate in our daily work. 

> I have been working for a few years on the idea of remote working. I see the COVID epidemics as a force that could accelerate a societal shift that we should do anyway, for the sake of climate change. 

An *idée fixe* of Howard's is [move conferences online](https://www.patreon.com/posts/anon1138917760-to-plan-and-34594233). Just [like ourselves](/t/11263), he got interested in it mostly because large international conferences have a large climate impact. Of course, this is not at all easy, and requires effort; but suddenly, from lockdown, we are discovering that it might be possible after all. A similar advance is happening in the world of online learning (again, Howard was one the pioneers of this), as schools and universities bend over backwards to reach out to locked-down students.

> You could be bringing orgs to remote work. In my experience, most people doing it have an approach oriented to deploying tools, typically chosen by some IT department. They miss completely the human and social dimension of working online. Community managers have existed for almost 40 years – actually John, here, was the person who first used the expression ""community manager""! They are key to getting humans to work together well online, but they are typically excluded from the corporate world. 

Helping people to work online is super powerful, because it increases manifold the efficiency of their organizations. @anon1138917760ard_rheingold:  

> This is a historical transition. I predict that, at the end, medical/scientific work will be enormously accelerated by this connectivity. 

@anon2516847305: 

> Howard, do you think that Slack is a complete solution to online collaboration?

@anon1138917760ard_rheingold:

> No, I do not. Slack is good at coordination, but not at accumulating/organizing knowledge. For that you need a forum. Also, in general, different people are comfortable with different media. So, a mix of media is needed. Like now we are talking on videoconference, then I suppose someone will do a writeup of it, and so on. That is a good thing.  

@anon1075425386:

> ... though then curation becomes even more important, both human curation (community management) and content curation (wikis, documentation etc.). Very easy to lose the overview of a workstream that happens in many different spaces. In Edgeryders we have found nothing better than a combination of recaps (written, as posts in the forum) and periodic (virtual) team meetings.

Speaking of this, I found out about this interesting project that's working to create an **open-source COVID-19 test kit**, work carried out online on this platform [Just One Giant Lab (JOGL)](https://app.jogl.io/project/118). I didn't know it, but it seems legit to me...

I am no biologist, nor a project manager, but I meant to share this opportunity with Edgeryders in case there is someone here that could help and is interested in sparing some time.

Great to see you here @anon1138917760ard_rheingold ! @anon2516847305 mentioned an uptick in interaction at The Well. Is Brainstorms still around Howard? Do you see an uptick there too (I haven't been in Brainstorms in ages).

Two observations I made in the past few weeks that touch upon this conversation. 

1) Yes there is a long list of unconnected initiatives out there currently. Looking at a range of them here in the Netherlands, while some seem to have some substance, many others seem more a coping strategy that keeps one busy but has no impact or meaning on the originator's scope of action or anyone else's agency. Kind of like the way I keep a spreadsheet with case numbers in NL, providing a sense of control or something, but then announcing it to the world as yet another Covid dashboard for coders and designers to contribute to.
At the same time initiatives that might have a real impact are invisible and never mentioned online unless they become visible once creating such impact.  (e.g. my brother in law's 3d printer company has approached all businesses and factories that use their printers to donate printing capacity, creating a global networked printing facility, and now discussing with manufacturers (like Phillips) and health ministries anon1138917760 to deploy that network to print respirator parts and masks where needed. It won't be publicly announced as a bottom-up initiative, and it may not be publicly mentioned at all ever.) How do we filter wheat and chaff on a list of initiatives, or do we have a role in guiding others to potentially more meaningful activities and away from the coping projects like my spreadsheet/ other's shiny dashboards?

2) On working from home en masse. Most of my work is with government entities. A common tactic for people is to wait with doing something and ignore emails etc until the requester sanon1138917760s up at your desk asking about it . That escalation path is no longer available, sanon1138917760ing up at one's desk. As a result I see some civil servants withdraw on an island of clearly defined tasks, simply not responding to mails,calls etc about any other topic.  A withdrawal. This means that all kinds of activities that depend on weaving together different acts by different parts of an organisation have more trouble building the connections and getting things done. This impacts precisely the type projects (around digital transformation, deploying new remote working tools, running experiments etc.) that would be of more interest now than before the current situation. Something to find a way of dealing with."

Great point. Anecdotally, I too am seeing people reaching out through personal networks. A lot is going on behind the curtains. In my case, it's mostly systemic reflections in view of what comes next, but more practical people like your brother-in-law seems to be be will be taking action. Another example of action, which I would like to document next week, is @anon3614937280's initiative of spawning a disposable identity scheme to keep track of your susceptible-infected-recovered state.

They put into words what I have been struggling to articulate as the reason behind having organised the workshop on [AI and Justice](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-anon1138917760-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326/60) in Brussels on 19/11. This workshop was part of an ongoing conversation on our community platform [( overview here)](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ai-inequalities-and-justice-an-overview-of-all-documented-discussions-before-during-and-after-the-workshop/12014/3).

Its purpose is to make sense of what we can do to take agency over the development of our futures in the age of what is often framed as inevitable developments towards one of two outcomes: The undoing of humanity vs a path to save us from ourselves. 

What have I understood so far? It all boils down to the following:

##  We need new general principles of justice as a foundation for all policymaking in an age of networked technologies.


1) The ethics of substantial freedom. This includes citizens’ inalienable rights of ownership, control, access and possession of information about themselves and their communities.

2) The Capability Approach as defined by Amartya Sen. 

3) Data is not a commodity. In the digital society it is the equivalent of the air we breathe.

4) Optimisation is not neutral. The choice to optimise at all has to be assessed based on its potential impact on the substantial freedoms of the individual.

5) “The individual”, “the citizen” and the “Human” are understood to mean individual members of the species Homo Sapiens.

## If we wish to ensure rule of law in Europe, we need a principle of balance of investment when it comes to AI and other networked digital technologies. 

This means that for every investment of public resources into promotion, education, research, development, or monetisation of these new technologies - we need to ensure equal injection of  resources towards providing the means for the individual citizen to gain ownership, control, access and possession of information about themselves and their communities. 

These resources have to be directly accessible and accountable to the individual citizen and their community.

## A moonshot mission: 

 If we want to ensure that AI/New Internet Technologies serves european citizens and businesses Europe must invest in building, maintaining and developing public cloud infrastructure.

I'd emphatically agree, except that I'd scrap ""cloud infrastructure"" and put in ""open source IT infrastructure"".

The cloud is really just somebody else's computer. There may be efficiencies of scale, obtained in exchange for a massive lack of control. Network speeds inside Europe (25 - 100 Mbit/s via ADSL and VDSL in most places now) is already sufficient for self-hosting, for taking back full control. Of course that needs a massive investment both into open source software (to make it nice and simple to use) and into skills. For the latter, I'd create an obligatory subject in school, called ""server and data management"". I mean, why not. Controlling and safeguarding ones own data is a skill that will be useful even in 100 years if (!) Europe decides to go that way rather than continue on the current road of letting everyone else but not the citizen take control of citizen data …

To flesh this out a bit, the type of public and open source IT infrastructure I'd like to see for an efficient and enjoyable data-driven society would include the following. I don't focus on AI technology, as that's just another (and slightly more powerful) type of algorithm, not fundamentally changing what computers can be applied for.

* **Company starter kit.** Basically all the tools we are building or still missing to run a small company like Edgeryders, as an integrated open source toolkit. Including an open source version of FreeAgent, which again must include cashflow projection etc. …

* **Federated messaging and calling.** Instant messaging is a nightmare by now, as we lack any recognized interoperable standard (like HTML, e-mail etc.). So we have a lot of competing systems, and everyone needs up to 10 software packages for instant messaging and phone calls these days. They do the same, more or less, and it's a nightmare to use, worse than the public phone system that is being replaced with these tools. A Europe-wide standard for mandatory interoperability between these systems would be a great start. And of course an open source, security audited reference implementation. Like e-mail servers or Riot / Matrix, this system should run decentralized on multiple servers, and people would then have that server running in their own home typically, as part of their Internet router hardware.

* **OpenStreetMap as the official map.** OpenStreetMap is great because, with map software like [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/), it became anon2298377336 simple to contribute to a ""wiki map"" of the world. I do that sometimes in combination with cycling trips in the forest. It's not perfect yet: the user experience must become better, and governments should be mandated to contribute all their own geospatial data there.

* **Consent-based advertising.** Currently, advertising is very similar to the worst case of anon1138917760 women experience online dating: lots of attention seeking and often disgusting messages, and other uninvited and unwelcome advances. Instead, just like more modern (OkCupid style) online dating, advertising should be based on audience consent. Practically: I may accept and even welcome a product advertisement message from a company *which I like*, and for that I want to browse through company profiles at times and select those I like. Another case where a Europe-wide digital infrastructure would be a big win for citizens."

Is there a theoretical framework for this? I connect it with Philip Agre and perhaps some of the philosophical frameworks developed in the EU FIDIS program around 2005. But I also recognise some huge public-administrative challenges in e.g. Sweden with changing the ownership structure for personal data/information in this way (i.e. information about private persons has been used to ""optimize"" public services, and must, in order to fill this role, belong to the government).

Yes!

> 3. Data is not a commodity. In the digital society it is the equivalent of the air we breathe.

I wonder about the difference with copyright (and trademark) law here:

In copyright law, the holder of the right can unilaterally dictate to users of the work the terms of usage. Under data protection law, anon1138917760ever, it is the user of the data that unilaterally dictates the terms of usage to the holder of the right. Is either of these models envisaged or something different? For the air, surely it is the user of the air (a polluting industry, for instance) that dictates to the holder of the right to air (the population, perhaps?) the terms of usage. Someanon1138917760. 

> 4. Optimisation is not neutral. The choice to optimise at all has to be assessed based on its potential impact on the substantial freedoms of the individual.

!!! Yes. There was a very good ""understreckare"" in Svenska dagbladet about this one and a half decade ago, or so, that questioned the concept of ""effectivization"". What does it mean to make something ""more efficient"" (one of the primary goals of digitalization, in both EU and Swedish mainstream politics)?

Indeed, we have. My point is rather that cloud infrastructure is not very useful in general – or should not be, as with proper decentralization and local control of data, there are only a few use cases for high-performance data centers. In political organization, we have federation (5 levels here in Germany). In data management, we only have centralization (""data centers""). It does not have to be that way …

Substantial, right?

What kind of industrial policy, tech policy and data policy would prevent the emergence of quasi-monopolies like ATOS in the first place?"

It's a good question. Industrial policy ties into tech, innovation, data and security policy because it's ultimately about preserving the material welfare of (at least parts of) the local population. In the EU it's a huge challenge that all the local populations are not the same - e.g., benefitting ATOS will almost certainly provide a material benefit to someone in France, but it's not clear that this benefit will disseminate to other parts of Europe in equal measure.

We can interpret ""benefit"" or ""material welfare"" as in the Capabilities Approach by Sen (as proposed by @anon2674660368  above) if that's convenient. 

This opinion piece by Piotr Arak starts out a bit shaky, but I think the latter half explains pretty well the problem of a green economy from a Polish perspective: https://euobserver.com/opinion/146932 I think we could add the ""ATOS-problem"" to the complexity, e.g., Arak raises the issue of the ""materials industry problems"" (implying, I think correctly, that subsidizing the industry for eco-materials is unlikely to increase the capabilities of Polish rural communities) - and the ATOS problem is the same. 

If the goal is simply to avoid quasi-monopolies like ATOS (and I'm not sure in which industry segment they'd be particularly dominant?), then perhaps ortholiberalism coupled with some Tim Wuean concept of lowered market entry barriers would be sufficient. If the goal is, on the other hand, to spread capabilities around Europe, we'd have a more difficult task at hand."

### Background and motivation to the workshop

Internet, computers and programming is introduced from birth in our children's lives. The current generation is the first, that never will have experienced a world without internet.

As coming generations enter the educational system, they are now introduced to tools, thoughts and concepts derived from the digital world. Today, most of them are proprietary - opposite to free and open source.

What happens to knowledge in our future digital world if proprietary world views on computers, internet and programming are left unchallenged?

Free and open source values, such as transparency, collaboration, freedom and empowerment - are already cornersanon3386180186es in our educational systems. So why don't we apply them when it comes to teaching computers?

The hypothesis is that teachers simply don't know enough of anon1138917760 free and open source really is central to knowledge itself. I believe we need to educate teachers and leaders in schools/academia in this area. That is anon1138917760 we change the game for the benefit of future generations of internet citizens.

This workshop aims to help to bring together actors in the educational systems with those from the core free and open source landscape. YOU are invited! Together we'll try to find ways to influence the educational system towards open source values. We stage the workshop to learn from joint experiences and develop concrete ways to reach the education system.

### What will you experience?

Learn about the cornersanon3386180186es of Free &amp; Open Source and anon1138917760 those are fundamental to learning anything in a digital world.

Collaborate on anon1138917760 to reach out to teachers with this message as one important group to win.

Have a great time shaping the next generation internet citizens.

I see a two step process here:

1. Come together some experts, discuss and produce some material on: ""How do we explain and educate in the four freedoms of FOSS to teachers and students""?

2. Then, a plan on anon1138917760 we run this education through our community in a good and way such as they too can teach others?

The rationale for this strategy is:
Since computers and programming gets introduced very early in children's lives today - planting FOSS values is of critical importance in anon1138917760 the next generation of internet citizens reflect on software and its use/implementation. Today, they get pumped even in school, with the message from a proprietary world view: ""copyright"", ""limited use"", ""eula:s"", ""trademark"", ""Intellectual property"", ""patents"", ""digtal right managements"", ""activation codes"", ""geo blocking"", etc. etc. etc. These are the things taught in schools today.

We, as in IOH, need to work out a means to foster a generation that desire something else and it needs to start with a narrative that can be understood by teachers, students and people not experts in computer science.

In my role as Open Source officer at Scanai and board member of Open Source Sweden I can provide contact with higher academics should this develop that way, but its likely best to allow this to grow and develop inside a community that already share these values.
I can also provide access to a ""test platform"" in form of a school (Gymnasium, 17-19 years) to test the education. I know a teacher that would love to participate in such a setup. I might even pull strings on the ""Gymnasiechefen"" in Stockholm, who happens to be a relative.

These above items are all ""possible"" paths later, but lets start small and create the education for ourselves first?"

I can also provide access to a “test platform” in form of a school (Gymnasium, 17-19 years) to test the education. I know a teacher that would love to participate in such a setup. I might even pull strings on the “Gymnasiechefen” in Stockholm, who happens to be a relative.

[/quote]

I assume with ""programs"" you mean smaller open source software projects.

It is not difficult to find such situations, but the answer to the kind of ""inverse"" question **is true as well**: ""Doesnt it happen that open source projects can be continued by other person(s) after the original creator(s) do not support them anymore?"".

And in contrast to the also often happening event that a **proprietary software product gets the plug pulled out**, at least there is the technical and legal possibility to continue using (or migrating) that specific technology.

So, I do not really understand where your question points at. I see a couple of points (maintainer burnout, blind dependency on projects with unclear (future) stories, and all the reasons that lead to failing or abandoned projects).

Besides, it is not the programs that run into the trouble, but those users relying on it and not being able to create a situation (or society :) ), where safety nets or a responsibility chain (you are holding one end yourself) are in place for the stuff one relies on.

[/quote]

Open Source (for humans) - in my opinion - is not about saving anyones money. Its about maintaining a culture of **transparency, collaboration, empowerment and freedom.** 

Running computer systems, in any form, comes with a cost - be it your time or your money - its equally true.

Its true also, that if you don't care - you are still free (under the four freedoms of foss) to USE the software as you please. However, if you think that running/modifying the software comes **without cost**, you need to rethink. Free and Open Source Software has nothing to do with cost. Its about what principles the software operates under. In FOSS software, those principles are ""hacked"" into western copyright law by utilizing a license scheme that guarantee the [four freedoms](https://openedreader.org/chapter/stallmans-four-freedom/) for anyone and mandates that this freedom is passed forward. Its popularly called ""copyleft"", but its really just a hack of the existing anglosaxian copyright. As curiosa on this is that it was not until this year that the chines law recognized open source licenses as valid at all under Chinese law which tells a story about the current copyright legislation and its reach."

However, I it's important to stress that when looking at this there are multiple other capitals that are changing which can be game changers, such as the social capital, as in FOSS with the idea of empowering the user (such as school kids) to read the source code of school systems and learn which opens up for building new intellectual capital and other capitals.

The festival site is updated by picking up content from our discourse platform (where we are right now) that is tagged a certain way. So to begin with what you do is creae a new post and copy past the content of the google doc into it. More info here:


https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-festival-website-is-now-online-here-is-anon1138917760-you-can-add-content-to-it/10825

The way we will be promoting events, pushing out calls for participation and support is to point people either to the festival site or the individual post on edgeryders.eu that contains the information about the event in it.   

When we do communication outreach we try to think of people who are well connected in the networks where we will find many people we are looking for. And we have to think about the constraints under which people are working. 

As I understand it, teachers in Sweden are underpaid and overwhelmed with an ever growing burden of tasks. So rather than try to engage them directly, perhaps it makes sense to start with people who have a direct interest in children drawing the benefits of open source?

My first hunch would be technologists/ graduates of technical university programs who have  children in school that we might want to reach out to. People who work in tech companies in Sweden and have school age children might be a good starting point. What do you think? Are they also likely to be members of some of specific labour unions? Where else might we find them... @anon280016435 might know about anon1138917760 KTHs Alumni association works?  

Another could be networks of people living in Sweden who went to schools like Hyper Island or the Chaos Pilots (@anon215618117 might know if there is an alumni association/ some way of reaching them).

Then we know that a lot of people likely to be on linkedin, facebook and instagram. There @anon3306141428 will have a better idea of anon1138917760 to reach out to and engage people via those channels."

## Bakgrund till workshopen

Internet, datorer och programmering blir idag omedelbart en del i våra barns liv. Kommande generationer, kommer aldrig upplevt en värld utan internet och datorer.

I utbildningssystemet, introduceras de för verktyg, tankar och begrepp härledda från den digitala världen. Det är i skolan vi formar mycket av vår världsbild och idag är det mesta av den stängd, trots att den borde vara öppen.

Vad händer egentligen med kunskap en digital framtid om en stängd vy på mjukvara och internet får lämnas outmanad i skolan?

Fri och öppen mjukvara präglas av transparens, samarbete, frihet och bemyndigande. Etablerade hörnstenar i vårt utbildningssystem. Så varför lever vi inte som vi lär när det gäller det här området som kommer forma våra barn i grunden?

Hypotesen är att skolvärlden saknar djup och kunskap hur fri och öppen källkod spelar en central roll i hur kunskapen om den digitala världen fungerar. Att utbilda lärare och ledare på detta område är så vi hjälper kommande generationer att forma nästa generation av internetmedborgare.

Agerar du redan i skolvärlden, är ditt deltagande välkommet och kommer du från ett open source engagemang och från mjukvaruvärlden, är din kunskap och erfarenhet central för att forma innehållet.

### Vad kommer du att uppleva?

Du kommer få chans att lära om hörnstenar inom fri &amp; öppen mjukvara och hur de är grundläggande för kunskap i en digital värld.

Du får möjlighet att dela med dig av din kunskap inom skola, mjukvara eller både och - samt - ta del av andras.

Du kommer få samarbeta med experter och entusiaster om hur vi når ut till skolväsendet.

Du kommer träffa människor med samma brinnande intresse för att forma kommande generationers internet i en spännande miljö.

Jag sträcker ut en hand nu till mina svenska nätverk eftersom jag tror att deltagande på den här workshopen i första hand kommer vara från sverige.

Jag skulle behöva hjälp att nå ut till en massa nätverk av lärare och open source entusiaster. All hjälp jag kan få är välkommet och jag hoppas även du vill komma och hjälpa till forma nästa generation av internetmedborgare.

Exempel på nätverk som jag vill nå ut till de kommande veckorna är:

* Meetups ni känner till.
* Arbetsplatser som präglas av IT
* Skolor och skolledare
* Studentnätverk - KTH, stockholms universitet, lärarhögskolan etc.
* Kommunpolitiker.
* Andra personer i dina nätverk
* Ledare och beslutsfattare med ""digital profil""
* Ledare och beslutsfattare med ""skolprofil""
* Lärare - alla.

Jag som arrangerar eventet har en länk till min ""bio"" här: https://eriklonroth.com

Jag finns inte på Facebook, så där skulle jag också behöva hjälp med att skicka ut information till de grupper som finns där. Om **du** vill hjälpa mig vara en Facebook ambassadör så tveka inte en sekund att höra av dig =)

Slutligen vänder jag mig nu till dig som har ett brinnande intresse i det här communityt kring frågor om internet, lärande, skola och open source. Du behövs för att göra den här workshoppen verklig. Vill du vara med och göra en insats?"

My first hunch would be technologists/ graduates of technical university programs who have children in school that we might want to reach out to. People who work in tech companies in Sweden and have school age children might be a good starting point. What do you think? Are they also likely to be members of some of specific labour unions? Where else might we find them… @anon280016435 might know about anon1138917760 KTHs Alumni association works?

Another could be networks of people living in Sweden who went to schools like Hyper Island or the Chaos Pilots (@anon215618117 might know if there is an alumni association/ some way of reaching them).

Then we know that a lot of people likely to be on linkedin, facebook and instagram. There @anon

No sorry I will not be attending any event and also cannot produce anything streamlined. I thought if you have some slides to share, I'd be very interested. If you have anon1138917760ever some 75%-done slides or posters, I can look at them and give somewhat qualified feedback (if you share it on a nextcloud with Collabora Office I can add comments without interfering with your workflow. I guess OnlineOffice has the same feature)."

Thanx for your feedback. I don't have any slides yet as I will prepare the material during the week.

Interesting that you mention Nextcloud + Collabora. I have built a Juju bundle that anyone can deploy and use to get their private/open source cloud running. 

More about Juju and the Nextcloud bundle here: https://jaas.ai/u/anon

I think @anon280016435 @anon3840432354x @anon1075425386 might be interested in this. Juju simplifies the process of getting complex systems deployed - such as - Nextcloud. Juju is open source and so are all the other components used within the projects. This is my personal exploration also of removing myself as much as possible from the AD-driven economy discussed here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-is-to-be-done-about-the-ad-based-internet-economy/9821/112) Its a great feeling and I also reap huge benefits from the flexibility I have. 

Even though all this is a bit off topic, you really highlight the principal boundaries between humans being ""subscribers"" to someone else's code - vs - empowered community members. This is something we can cover also during the workshop. Exciting times!"

*Workshop 28:th november 2019 in Stockholm*

Participants ranged from:  Academia, Software industry, Media, Entrepreneurship

* A full day of learning, sharing experiences and discussions.

* Teaching open source values in schools and general academia is much needed but faces significant resistance. We concluded that the drivers for adopting technology – any – in schools are generally driven by proprietary interests with anon2726675500 or no philosophical or ethical value ground. Proprietary software providers have the resources for marketing and lobby, plus, access to decision makers and policymakers. Winning over that force requires mobilizing our collective networks to create awareness and gain influence over these very important decisions of our time.

* Continued efforts in educating our networks on why open source is important and anon1138917760 we can gain momentum is needed. Its also fun and appreciated.

* New workshop planned in 2020 to bring more networks together and increase the education on the topic.

* Stay connected on the Edgeryders platform: https://edgeryders.eu/t/teaching-teachers-open-source/9881

* The food during the workshop was fantastic!


**The Research Questions**
*Method & Disclaimer:* 

We did a survey during the workshop addressing these questions.
To protect the integrity of the participants, I have excluded the raw material from this document. The scientific value will be low off-course, but the reader may want to participate in future workshop to assess the relevancy. Take it for what it is.

**==== Research Question: #1 Summary ====**

>  *“Gain better understanding of the current view on ethics related to computer science and anon1138917760 that view affects all  education in the age of internet.”*

I found from the survey that most people don’t know about the foundational values that govern free and open source. Most are self taught on computer science and consult relatives and friends on topics related to the digital world we live in. Almost nobody get their new knowledge from institutions. This raises many questions.

‘Not even software developers’ seems aware about the fundamentals of open source and the four freedoms. Since those are the baseline for all legal frameworks within open source licenses, copyright law, patent etc. this raises also more questions on anon1138917760 practice and policies are made in real life.

**==== Research Question: #2 Summary ====**

> *”Articulate a few core principles or concepts that would help teachers navigate when educating in the age of internet and computers.”*

I found that its difficult to form consistent or shared thoughts on ethics without a common ground on which to base these ethics on. Despite the enlightened crowd participating in the workshop, opinions on “what”, “anon1138917760” and “why” in software is not well grounded.

Most people learned about “computers and internet” late in their lives and the age of the participants was relatively high (about 30), which also reveals the immaturity of these issues at present day. It raises more questions about future generations, which was also the motivator for the workshop itself.

It was a shared opinion that questions on ethics and morals in relation to software in general were much needed in education.


**Exctraction from participants:**
 *Translated and minor edits to English from Swedish.*

Name a few things important to learn in schools:

> ”Participatory culture, the complexity of the works and noone should be just a consumer nor just producer.”

Name a few positive outcome from teaching open source in schools:

> ”Stronger democracy, co-creative citizens, increased empathy, more active, more self reliant and responsible.”

Have you ever reflected over ethics in relation to computers and internet?

> ”Yes, anon1138917760 it affects Exposure and Exclusion”

Who are the most influential sources to what is taught on computers and internet in schools today

> ”Politicians and Skolverket (Department of Education) but there is a responsibility with the parents.”

Have you ever reflected over ethics in relation to computers and internet?

> “A society divided between owners/capable, vs, unpropertied/incapable will have a bleak future.”"

I have not looked at the material but if it is, as you sa, it is sad. 

Open Source as code has no differentiator from proprietary code. It adds absolutely nothing from a practical perspective. 

Open source adds the value to the whole society primarily on the ethical level.

* Sharing of knowledge. 
* Collaboration before division. 
* Freedom through empowering. 

The functional aspects are secondary."

Here I agree :slight_smile:

Honestly, I find it hugely beneficial to be able to look up what happens at - lets say nextclouds database -  and not been dependent on a support team (which might even not exist anymore because the company went belly-up)! Or to verify that installing a sinatra web-app does not phone home. I consider the study,share,improve-freedoms very elemental ""practical"" benefits from using Open Source. And given the context (""learning"") they enable whole other dimensions of empowerment, collaboration, learning, research, etc."

A piece of code will be the same piece of code regardless of the license attached.

In that sense they differ nothing. 

The practical implications anon1138917760ever of attaching a good license which enforces access to the code (osi licenses) brings good things which are of values not inherited by the code itself. E.g. the code will not be 'better' in any way just because it's open source or not. 

anon3348677880 Stallman hacked intentionally the anglosaxian copyright law to codify ethics into licenses attached by open source programmers. The consequences are that these values (freedom, collaboration, empowerment, knowledge) are enforced even if you don't think they serve your business model."

However, ""practical implications"" are there for the empowered user, who uses the code (and/or other parts of the system, translation files etc) itself, whereas other users might just use the result of the code, which calculates the same independent of its license."

## We want to invite you to the ViConnect Play&Culture Prototype Event 
*This is the next step in the development of a webinar series using analogue drawing and VR technology to give you and your children a creative outlet and way to connect during the lockdown as well as a forum for a meaningful and creative borderless conversation.* 
The initiative and design of this workshop is by @anon1785662177 

[You can see the start of the idea and conversation here in this post about the VR Drawing.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-can-we-do-together-drawing-on-some-virtual-reality-dreams/13178)

### When:  
3rd of May, 16:00 - 17:30 CEST
[date=2020-05-03 timezone=""Europe/Brussels""]

### How to Join:
Comment to this post that you are interested and we will add you to the rsvp list and share the time and link to the call with you. 

We are going to use our new Edgryders call tool with a secure rsvp list to make sure you and whatever you share is safe.

After stating your interest in this thread, just join via this link: 
# now.edgeryders.eu/call/13306

### What:
We invite 4-5 families with children between 5 and 13 to join us for the first prototype run.

### We will teach you anon1138917760 to get from a simple analogue sketch your children can do at home.

### To a VR room of their own design which they can share with others:

<iframe width=""100%"" height=""640"" style=""width: 100%; height: 640px; border: none; max-width: 100%;"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allow=""vr,gyroscope,accelerometer,fullscreen"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://kuula.co/share/7FwQ2?fs=1&vr=0&sd=1&thumbs=1&chromeless=0&logo=0""></iframe>

In the Webinar you will learn anon1138917760 to do this and go on a VR journey with a Koala visiting Europe for the first time, asking the children for help to see their worlds during the lockdown :). 

It's going to be a great experience for you, your children and us and also the prototype for a larger course series we are currently developing (see bellow)

### The future ViConnect course series coming after the prototype:

ViConnect is an inherently European project. A course series and online teach/connection method is developed in collaboration with Edgeryders, its diverse international community and the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education [OMEP](https://www.omepitalia.org/). It uses technology to empower creativity and transfer skills and knowledge for online teaching, the articulation and communication of culture and distributed collaboration. The course series consists of three one-week courses:*

*Each course will teach the participants anon1138917760 to draw analogue sketches and paintings which can be transformed into VR environments in connection to a topical conversation and co-creative learning. We address 3 interconnected key-groups and topics which are especially relevant during the current crisis directly:*

*1. ViConnect Learning (first week, 10 - 20 participants )*: Addresses educators and parents. We discuss the challenge of making virtual classrooms effective and using creativity and virtual reality to make digital teaching more engaging and ask the participants to use the experiences to design their “dream virtual classroom” to discuss further.

*2. ViConnect Culture & Play (second week, 5-10 Families)*: Addresses children and parents to make virtual reality accessible to children and give them a creative outlet in times of quarantine and curfew and method of sharing their ideas and culture and to create awareness of the diversity of culture in Europe. Via a playful story we discuss and share culture and current situations: Children are asked to create VR-drawings to explain their home to a fictional character visiting Europe for the first time and are not allowed to travel due to lockdown.

*3. ViConnect Work (third week, 10 - 20 participants)*: Addresses distributed/home office workers. We will discuss challenges and solutions for distributed work informed by the large distributed collaboration manual already developed by Edgeryders. The participants will be asked to use the VR-drawing technique to sketch their “dream home office”; the conversation will inform the ongoing development of another distributed collaboration MOOC by Edgeryders.

We want to invite you to the ViConnect Play & Culture Prototype Event.

Hers is a nuanced reflection, to which I cannot fully do justice here. Nevertheless, I would like to comment on one of her points: that the pandemic, as it ravaged so many human lives and endeavors, has strengthened large tech companies.

> The obvious big winner of the COVID-19 crisis so far has been Big Tech. Where most sectors of the economy have seen demand collapse, many large tech companies are reporting [record profits](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/30/first-real-recession-big-tech-era-double-edged-sword-silicon/), and have been able to use this momentum to further consolidate market share. With more of us reliant on technology for our daily lives than ever before, we have become more willing to turn a blind eye to the excesses and ethical shortcomings of these companies and their business models. The so-called “end of the techlash” would no doubt be seen as a welcome break after years of negative headlines and mounting public pressure. But will it turn out to be a temporary respite for the internet giants, or are we witnessing a more permanent concentration of power over yet more aspects of our society and economy?

Katja formulates it as a question, but her article seems to have an answer: the Internet giants appear more unshakeable than ever. One piece of evidence stayed with me: 

> Jeff Bezos has so far added 25 billion to [his net-worth](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-twice-as-wealthy-as-mark-zuckerberg-2020-4?r=US&IR=T) this year, while[ 60 percent](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/15/coronavirus-has-left-small-publishers-desperately-fighting-for-survival) of UK independent bookstores expect they might not survive this crisis.

Her argument so far is very persuasive, almost inevitable. But I do not completely agree with what comes next:

> It is not just their sizable battle chests that leaves Big Tech so well positioned in this current crisis. Because credit where credit is due: the privileged new class of remote workers can only be sustained because we have access to solid, well-functioning digital tools courtesy of the data barons of the new Gilded Age. 

This is just not true. Remote office work could be done (and *was* done, by a lot of people) in the 1990s. With Mediawiki to replace version control with an edit history (developed 2002) + any chat (which hark back to IRC, developed 1988) you could do 95% of what people do today with MS Teams and the like, give or take bells and whistles. You could even argue that many bells and whistles *reduce* productivity: the rise of Zoom and the like make meetings easier to have online, and meetings tend to be a drag on the productivity of many people. Don't take my word for it, [ask Scott Adams](https://dilbert.com/strip/1996-07-05).

The lionization of tech companies strikes me as deeply unfair. The most unfair is probably Netflix's. In 1999, Shawn Fanning built Napster as a robust, scalable file sharing service. At that point we could exchange and share multimedia files. Industry sent in copyright lawyers and lobbyists and took it down, and then built it again, sold it to us, and are now using the proceedings to crush independent cultural and media enterprises. In her book *The Entrepreneurial State*. Mariana Mazzucato makes the point that most groundbreaking tech innovation has been made by public sector researcher and funded by taxpayers, with Big tech (and its financial sector-alter ego, venture capital) stepping in when the high-risk work was done, to privatize the reward. That's rent seeking. 

A world with great digital tools that are not owned and wielded by Big Tech is absolutely within reach. In fact, Katja herself mentions city halls in Europe  deploying Jitsi servers so that schools can host online lessons. Further on, she discusses resilience: and this would be a major piece of resilience – the equivalent of 19th century municipalist socialism, when cities built their own utility companies (from transport to energy) to escape the yoke of private monopolies. I am looking forward to seeing whether any polity embraces it."

There are and have been many different forms of remote work. Different reasons for doing it, different tools used. I think the trend rightnow to calls all of that into one class and oppose it with (essential) worker's who can not work from home even if they and their company wanted it is presenting a wrong picture and conflict. Yes, right now there is a big different in the live of people who's work can be done remotely and that of those whose can not, but there are many more different factors within those groups. And yes, currently many of those rely on tools provided by big companies, but those are not the only way to sustain this type of work as Alberto pointed out. And if the need for a tool exists and the flexibility to start using it, initiatives come u to develop it. Many of those end up being bought up and incorporated or simply copied in the current set up, which is where those sizeable cests come back in. Maybe the stewardship models could be interesting there.

I think the bit about me now praising Big Tech is perhaps a bit of a accidental ""selective editing"" from the text- as it was meant more as a sarcastic bit about anon1138917760 they've now so entrenched their power that they are better able to uphold the kinds of infrastructures that we now rely on- not that we necessarily need to use Big Tech always, or that no alternatives exist. The problem is that alternatives like Jitsi can now not (yet) meaningfully compete because of the underlying conditions that have made the Big Tech so powerful. This is no way me praising Big Tech for providing us with services- it is challenging the laziness of the ""end of the techlash"" narrative! Later on I also say that I hope this might just give us the impetus to more permanently transition to open source alternatives etc. - it's just that the conditions *currently* aren't there, and that many have been too complacent to switch. 

Regarding working from home: Of course working from home was possible before- the point was more that it is a privilege to work in a jobs that can be done remotely- most particularly lower-paid jobs don't allow for this (i.e. manual work, many segments of the service economy, etc.). Jobs that can be made meaningfully made to done remotely disproportionately require university degrees, etc. 

It is not the only facet of discussions about class of course, and there are also those in lower-paid jobs who can work from home and vice versa, but the current crisis has revealed and accelerated a growing divide (discussed in far more detail further down in the blog) that we need to be wary off. This is not against remote work, it is against remote work becoming a driver of growing inequality. The solution here is probably in bringing more resilience, and enabling more people to find that flexibility in their work."

Don't worry, this is perfectly clear. On the other hand, the facts that you report – FAANG stock soaring as the economy nosedives, Bezos's transcendent wealth – are true. And they point to that direction. In other words, even if you don't buy the argument that ""the data barons are giving us robust tools we need"", most people and governments do. I am making my point not to contradict you, but to contradict that narrative. Which, is guess what? once again this toxic, misleading idea of ""innovation"" as something done by ""risk-taking"" private entrepreneurs, who ""create value"" by their ""creativity"". I am so tired of this.

Meanwhile, I just read this Guardian piece by Naomi Klein, [""How Big Tech Plans to Profit from the Pandemic.""](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-anon1138917760-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic)

Her focus is largely on the efforts by former Google boss Eric Schmidt in advocating for his former company and their peers like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and Facebook, to essentially take over the information infrastructure for pretty much everything in life in the future.  It starts describing him pitching the need for China-level surveillance in order to compete with China.  I thought at first that Ms Klein was overhyping her point until i scrolled down to the slides Schmidt used to pitch his vision.  Based on what is in it, I don't doubt that Trump likes this guy and his vision.  It brushes privacy and the public's rights aside if it wants to be like China.  He calls mass surveillance a ""killer app for deep learning"" and touts the virtues of a city ""carpeted with cameras.""

And of course these Smart Services will be brought to us via outfits like Sidewalk Labs which almost wired up the Toronto waterfront as a Smart City area, but the city dropped it over privacy questions from the public along with not enough apparent public benefit.  But Sidewalk and all have moved on and are now working up something bigger with New York and Governor Cuomo.

And we know that some services that require high info tech can be deployed in ways that protect privacy. And of course we know about Rob's disposable identity project.  And I could imagine a guy like Schmidt paying attention and value into ensuring the rights of people. But surveillance made him a billionaire and he has no track record that I know of in placing high value on the privacy and rights of individuals.

Into this comes the pandemic. Whereas that vision for the urgent need to adopt mass surveillance tech was pitched as a national security issue, suddenly there is this pivot toward using these same tech companies and their technologies as benevolent branon2855557573rs of our survival needs.  And Schmidt is pitching the tech for education, home health, etc etc..  It reminds me of the ""atoms for peace"" program that got shoved down our throats in the 50s when it was really always about nuclear weapons.  But bomb shelters were scaring people and by the way not selling, so then it was decided to embark on all these huge projects to sanon1138917760 us what a friend the uranium atom really is.  I remember it all anon2298377336 well.

Scary essay.  I know Naomi Klein, author of ""The Shock Doctrine"" can serve up a large dose of shock herself, and in this she delivers.  I hope she is wrong, but I think she is correct.

To me a lot of the tie-in to big Net companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. is they are led by people who, to me, also see themselves as thought leaders of aspects outside their expertise.  Schmidt assuming he knows anon1138917760 education is supposed to work, or Elon Musk talking about almost anything.

You know, I completely agree on a human level. But is there a lot we can do about it? Probably not. It will come, because there is a lot of money to be made from pushing more bits through the air. So then it becomes a race to the top/bottom (depending on your perspective) as with all technologies, and the answer becomes - because if we don’t have it, but China/Russia/Nigeria/Brazil do, Europe will lag behind economically. Is it a satisfying answer? Not really. But at least in this case, this particular technological race doesn't seem like it will have hugely detrimental environmental effects."

So it is possible and to say otherwise or suggest otherwise is, in my view, irresponsible.

Exactly. Even from a purely technological perspective, it's not needed. What we'd need is data efficiency when we use the existing infrastructure. In the last 20 years, nobody cared about data efficiency in networks. It's always about more data throughput, without asking if the data we send still _means_ anything much? My guesstimate is that >95% of the data transferred does not mean anything. The exact same content and behavior could be transported with the remaining 5%. For example, we could remove all the bloated JavaScript of advertising trackers. Or (but that's a recent innovation) we could transition from JPG images to [BPG](https://banon204016368rd.org/bpg/) (asanon3386180186ishing side-by-side comparison [here](https://banon204016368rd.org/bpg/lena.html) and [here](http://xooyoozoo.github.io/yolo-octo-bugfixes/)) or to the (even better and completely free of patent nonsense) [AVIF format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1#AV1_Image_File_Format_(AVIF)).

I totally agree with the developer issues and it's simply compounded by the marketing for the new and shiny products too - you can watch 4k streamed video on your phone and take 50 Mega pixel photos to be stored on the cloud - This is what the consumer wants.  The consumer doesn't realise they can't see the difference between 740 and 1080 res on their phone let alone 4K and that their 50 mega pixel photo could be printed out at high res to be the size of a football pitch.

Over the past year I'm starting to believe that this would be a good thing - some days I look into a crystal ball and see that a crash is inevitable - and if it's sooner rather than later maybe we can scrape through.  

I don't want poverty but I do want alternatives and the economy is currently driven by capitalist wealth, debt and illnesses.  If we completely crash then maybe we would be more resourceful and people would turn their attentions to the real problems looming... (it's a view I'm nurturing out of frustration and currently being in the UK one, with anon3386180186gue in cheek, hope will happen if Brexit does finally go through - starting to address real issues being the only good thing I can think that will happen from that).

I'm really hoping that this Internet of Humans work I've stumbled upon will look into the ""alternatives"" to the perceived need for the likes of 5G so that there is either 1) the opportunity to do something before it's too late or 2) have some airbags ready for when it is too late.  Maybe we can invent/discover/create something that is an antidote and contribute towards the changes we need to see.

We run the risk of trying to integrate with the innovations generated from capitalist machinery and becoming lost in it or part of the problem, I'm not suggesting we ignore these innovations but I feel we need to assess their worth for humanity and adopt accordingly, challenging where necessary and looking for the integration hot spots to convert and transform others."

I just wrote a anon2726675500 thing about it:

It’s striking anon1138917760 fast Lenihan’s article took flight in right-wing media, and the news of Twitter’s action, in turn, was immediately picked up by many of the same news sources. RT [ran](https://www.rt.com/news/460596-twitter-antifa-journalist-lenihan-ban/) with the headline “Twitter bans researcher who exposed journalist ties to Antifa.”

But according to Yochai Benkler, a law professor at Harvard and a co-director of the university’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, this turns out is actually not surprising at all. In his book, co-authored with Harvard researchers Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts, “Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics,” they set out anon1138917760 we shouldn’t blame Facebook for the spread of falsehoods, but right-wing media instead.

“ *Most American news outlets try to adhere to facts. When something proves erroneous, they run corrections, or, as Benkler and his co-authors write, “they check each other.” Far-left Web sites post as many bogus stories as far-right ones do, but mainstream and liberal news organizations tend to ignore suspiciously extreme material. Conservative media outlets, anon1138917760ever, focus more intently on confirming their audience’s biases, and are much more susceptible to disinformation, propaganda, and outright falsehoods (as judged by neutral fact-checking organizations such as PolitiFact).* ” ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house))

Do we have a separate topic here? 

FWIW, I agree with you, @anon2205132963. I am fascinated by the value theory implications. If we make a claim that advertising is not an economic good, but rather an economic bad; and that much our bandwidth goes to carrying it, it follows that we could reduce our bandwidth _and_ increase our well-being at the same time. Increased well-being comes from two sources: a less bloated Internet, plus the additional stuff we could produce with the resources saved from not producing 5G. Libraries, hospitals, bicycle lanes, whatever. 

Value theory, value theory... :nerd_face:"

Efficiency is always defined in relationship to some goal: effort per unit of goal achieved. If your goal is revenue, collecting data (even data that you do not necessarily need to provide your core service) may be efficient *if you can resell them*. It goes back to value theory, since the concept of value encodes societal goals.

The GDPR principles state that you should not collect personal data, unless you need them to provide the service that you are out to provide."

They might, and surely do,  contend that they need all that data so they can serve the best ads for the best rate, and that this is a service they provide to you. But in fact they do not need to combine all that data since it really doesn't do much of anything for you.

As for 5G, what I don't want is what we have now: tech companies with a stake in the outcome telling us everything is fine and safe (I lived through the 50s where that was what the nuclear industries did), a government that will not step up to its role in protecting the public by making an objective determination (usually because the lobbies are too strong and donate too much money) and a bunch of noise from the troll factories spreading FUD all over."

She has conducted extensive research on multilingual communities in Belize, as well as the role of English within the shifting sociolinguistic economy of gentrifying Berlin. Most recently, she has turned her attention to human-machine interaction. At its core, Britta’s research uncovers the conceptual underpinnings of socio-cultural interaction, the interrelationship of language and belonging and forms of socio-spatial mobility. 

 

Britta is a member of the [European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)](https://www.cost.eu) and is part of a network of researchers working within its newly approved action [Language in the Human-Machine Era](https://www.cost.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oc-2019-1_Actions_Booklet-v1.pdf), where she will be in the management committee for Germany and vice-chair of the working group on language attitudes and ideologies.

 

Britta and I met for a virtual interview over Skype from our respective apartments in Berlin to discuss her latest research project, “The Construction of Language in Digital Society”, which examines post-human understandings of ‘correct’ and ‘normal’ language use. The project places its central focus on the impact of voice-controlled human-machine interaction on the conceptualization of computers as interaction partners as well as notions of language appropriateness in digital communication. Here is a link to her latest [piece](https://www.hiig.de/en/what-is-correct-language-in-digital-society-from-gutenberg-to-alexa-galaxy/), which appeared in the Digital Society Blog run by the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Digital Society. 

During our fascinating conversation, Britta and I discussed the ways in which concepts and norms of western, standardised language as well as notions of correctness and incorrectness are produced and reproduced through programming and machine learning, human-machine interaction, and the emerging emotional relationships between people and their voice-controlled digital assistants.

Below, you will find a shortened version of our interview, with some exciting examples from her ongoing study! (LS: anon1700913054 Schulte, BS: Britta Schneider)


**LS:** You are a member of a group of researchers involved in the new European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST), and you will be conducting research as part of the recently approved action, Language in the Human-Machine Era. Can you tell me more about this project and your involvement in it?

**BS:** The network is funded by the European Council. Dave Sayers, a sociolinguist from the UK, brought the project into being and it has just been approved in March 2020. It hasn’t officially started yet, but the idea is to bring together researchers with an interest in language, but with very different disciplinary backgrounds who are, in one way or another, involved with the topic of language and digital communication. This means there are computational linguists, language professionals such as IT programmers, people who study language in education, some who work on language variation, researchers interested in questions of language and law, language endangerment and language rights, and some who study language ideologies, and all in relation to the changes we face with regards to the human-machine era. So, the network is huge and there are several working groups that will realize conferences, meetings or summer schools within the next four years.

**LS:** Alongside your research as part of the COST action, you also launched your own study, “The Construction of Language in Digital Society”. Could you give me an overview of your project and research aims? 

**BS:** For several years now, I have been working on anon1138917760 languages – as entities – such as English, or German, or Spanish come into being. So, anon1138917760 the idea of a bounded, separable and static language is constructed by speakers. 
 
I have done research in multilingual environments, and what came out in my last research project in the Caribbean was that the kind of media that is associated with particular languages has significant impact on whether or not people think this language should be regular or standardised. So, if a language has a written tradition, people are much more likely to believe the language has to be fixed and regular: this highlights the crucial impact of the printing press and of writing technologies on our conception of language. I thought it would be very interesting to look at what happens to all of this in digital environments, where we no longer have the printing press as our main technology of producing mediated communication: anon1138917760 does the internet shape our concepts of language and our concepts of linguistic appropriateness, correctness, and standardness?

I thought it would be interesting to start by interviewing people who use Alexa or Siri and other voice-controlled digital assistants to understand anon1138917760 people interact with machines via their voices, and whether they believe they have to standardise their own speech in these interactions; whether they conceptualise these devices as authorities, or whether they experience that these devices learn to handle accents, dialect speech and other ‘irregularities’.

**LS:** You mentioned language ideologies. When sociolinguists and linguistic anthropologists talk about language ideologies, we describe normative sets of beliefs about the place and function of certain ways of speaking in society. And, of course, there is a long tradition of studying language ideologies within human-to-human interaction, and the ways in which ideologies of language can serve a policing function, dictating notions of correctness and incorrectness, prestige and authority. What do you think are aspects that might be different about the study of language ideologies in machine-human interaction?

**BS:** I think a relevant difference is that the frequency of occurrence of linguistic features in digital contexts plays a much more important role. This contrasts with traditional standards in Western cultures where a small elite of people decide what is correct and what is not correct. These traditional standards were unconceivable without technologies of writing and are still reified and controlled by grammarians, and other elite groups. This concept of written standard language now interacts with frequency: as soon as you have a certain language phenomenon occurring frequently online, then it might, sooner or later, be considered as correct by programmes and devices like Siri and Alexa. Whereas before, correctness might have been based on what appeared in lexicons, or if it appeared in a novel or grammar book – many written by male, educated, white speakers – now if certain words and phrases that appear very often, or rather, appear often in forms that machines can read, then they may  *become*  correct even if it would not have been labeled as ‘correct’ by a lexicon.

**LS:** You touched on this point at the beginning, but just to return to it in a bit more detail, there is a lot of research on anon1138917760 existing social biases and forms of inequality – for example forms of racial and gender injustice – are reproduced through algorithmic decision-making. And this is often due in part to the fact that the majority of people programming these algorithms are not representative of the wider population. Do you see any similar patterns with respect to anon1138917760 language ideologies and attitudes might be reproduced in the context of digital assistants? 

**BS:** Definitely. Users report to  *adapting*  their speech when they communicate with Alexa, even on a very fine-grained level, so that Alexa will understand them. This implies that Alexa is working with a conception of ‘correct’ speech that is based on the traditional norms and rules that we find in standardised written languages, and which insufficiently captures the breadth of different forms of speaking: accents, slang, etc. It also has been reported that – this doesn't appear in my data, but I have read in other studies – Alexa reacts better to male voices and that the frequencies with which it is programmed expect a male voice. 

One might assume that the more these devices are used, the more capable they are of learning and adapting to some degree. Therefore, the longer people use a device, the more it will be able to understand different speech patterns.

On the other hand, I also have German speakers in my dataset who report that they use it in English as there is a much larger database on which it draws and can therefore handle variation better in English, making it easier to use rather than in German.

**LS:** So, it’s not only about programmer's explicit or implicit attitudes towards the ‘correctness’ of a certain language variety, but it also seems to reify the hegemony of English – and probably Standard British of American English – as a medium of interaction, thereby making these digital assistants even less accessible to a range of users.

**BS:** Yes, and I think this is an important difference to previous language ideologies from the age of printing, in that we have to factor in both the size of the dataset as well as frequency of occurrence, which may conflict with traditional norms of language correctness.

I can give you an example from a German-English database called [Linguee](https://www.linguee.de), which is an online translation tool. It is based on websites that appear in English and in German. It simply uses a web crawler that looks for English and German websites, and when I used it, it occurred to me that some of the phrases that appear on it sounded pretty German. My hypothesis is if a German translator translates certain texts from German into English, then certain Germanisms will appear that are not necessarily wrong in English, but are unusual. However, if German speakers start to search for particular phrases, for example, ""die Barrieren senken"" or ""to lower the barriers"", which is a common phrase in German, but not so common in English, it still appears as a ‘normal’ phrase in Linguee because it appears on some websites. And then you have a looping effect of people using it because it appears on Linguee and is therefore considered to be correct, which, in turn, might drive native German speakers to continue using this phrase when they speak English. 

 In this way, our whole idea of correctness and whose authority this correctness is based on, is further complicated – which I really like about it.

**LS:** We have been speaking a lot about correctness. Can we unpack this notion a anon2726675500 more before we move on? Where do ideas of correctness come from?

**BS:** I think that the vast majority of people believe there is a form of language that is correct, and that everything else is not correct. And you devote years of teaching and training to learning this one correct way of speaking and writing. From a sociolinguistic or linguistic anthropological view, these notions of correctness are historical artefacts that we can deconstruct and critique: they are simply the language of the powerful, the language of those who were able to label a particular language variety as correct. So, there is nothing intrinsically correct in using a particular kind of relative pronoun or a particular kind of pronunciation. There is also nothing intrinsically incorrect about using a double-negative. It is simply our traditions and conventions that have been regularised in lexicons and grammar books and that have also come to influence the way all digital devices that deal with human language have been programmed.

**LS:** It sounds like you are also identifying a potential in these devices for disrupting these notions of correctness.

**BS:** I think it’s both. At the moment, I would think you have a double- development, where you have a reification of these norms and a destabilisation at the same time.

There are also cases of programmers explicitly trying to accommodate more variation. I spoke with a programmer who programs Cortana – the Microsoft voice-controlled digital assistant – and who worked on a project developing templates for the device in the Saxon German dialect. So, in some cases, as soon as you have an interest – if you have enough people who use a particular variety – there will be a capitalist interest in making such devices conform so that more people can use them.

But again, all of these efforts depend on certain existing power dynamics and inequalities in society. Some speakers may not have that kind of decision-making power and it is very difficult to adapt their speech. Using the standard language variety when interacting with technology can also be a form of symbolic subordination. And in other cases, there will never be a commercial interest in adapting linguistic templates, simply because there are not enough speakers of a particular variety or this variety is in itself more variable because it has no writing tradition or because the speakers themselves are socially marginalized (as for example [*Kiezdeutsch*](http://www.kiezdeutsch.de/aufeinenblick.html) or other multi-ethnic urban forms of speech). In my current study on Alexa users, these are so far only Germans who have been institutionally trained to use standard German and more or less identify with it. It would be important to do more research on more marginalised speakers, also in parts of the world where the idea of homogenous standards is not as dominant as it is in Germany and most other European countries.

Certainly, there is potential to have more language variety in digital assistants, but I don't think it will stay flexible forever. These systems will always be more responsive to the demographically more dominant variety, which is of course, typically a variety that already has had status and prestige for a very long time.

**LS:** What have you been observing with your informants? How are they viewing linguistic authority within these dynamics (if at all)?

**BS:** The speakers I worked with are all speakers of German as a first language and most spoke rather standard varieties of German. None of them really questioned the authority of Alexa and believe that it must know better because it had been programmed, so they adapt their speech. And, of course, also because they want to make the thing work. So, they don't really care. 

 
There was one case where someone reported that she used a local-dialect word for a particular kind of light but Alexa didn't understand and she was frustrated, but in the end, she simply used another word.

 

So, this was not such a core issue for my informants so far, but I did notice that they usually do not believe that Alexa has it wrong. Rather, they believe that they themselves are making mistakes and that they have to adapt their speech. 

 

Another interesting aspect is that these devices are given personal names so that users refer to them as though they were people. They also refer to them with personal pronouns that we usually use to refer to humans – and female humans, in particular. So, it’s always ""she"". Some speakers also use ""it"", but mostly ""she"". The most interesting point, I find, is that some speakers really develop an emotional relationship to their devices.

This suggests that using sound and voice – in a very literal sense – seems to do something to us as humans in contrast to communicating via the keyboard, for example: it facilitates the development of emotional relationships.

**LS:** I am reminded of a very early example from your project that you told me about during one of our meetings last year, of one of your informants who owns many of these devices in her home, and who has, over time, developed emotional relationships with all of them. 
         
If I remember correctly, she had different relationships to each of them, and she interacted with them in different ways. Can you tell me a bit more about her relationship to and interaction with her devices?

**BS:** So, in every room in her flat, she had two or three devices – in each room. And in this case, ""Alexa"" was conceptualised as one person, or let's say, interaction partner. But she had developed different relationships to each of the actual boxes – the tangible, material boxes – even though they all use the same voice.
 
She had one, for example, where she had put some stickers on it to look like a cat's face. She liked each box and she reported very openly to the fact that she had developed very emotional relationships to each of them. She had a closer relationship to the boxes with which she spoke more frequently: So, there was this one device in the living room that was the main speaker and the others were also speakers, but less important.

She also had two devices in her bedroom; one that would tell her stories at night to fall asleep, and another box that would play the sound of a fire – a fireplace. As far as I understood her, she had less of an emotional relationship to the device that would only play the sound of a fireplace than she did to the one that told her stories. 

She also told me about one device in her bathroom that is actually a bit broken, but she still uses it. I thought what she said about that was really interesting. She said, ""this box here has been recovered. She makes a lot more mistakes than the white one in my bedroom, but I let her get away with it. I don't want to give her away even if she has small flaws"". So, of course, she cannot really interact very easily with this one, but she says, ""yeah, I only ask her for the time or the weather"".
  
Most of my informants are actually male, middle-aged, work as consultants or something similar, and they often use it in the car during their commutes to and from work. In this way, Alexa is a kind of secretary. And they write emails and do everything they would do from their desk, but in the car – so it’s more of a practical relationship. In this sense, this one woman was a bit particular in her strong emotional relationship to her devices, but I am sure there are many more people who use it like this, and I think there is a lot of potential –  I don't want to glorify the development of these devices, and I am actually very critical of their development – but I am very sure there is a lot of potential for elderly people in this, and for people who are alone. Of course, it would be much nicer if everyone had a happy family life and many friends around them, but if someone doesn’t have that, I think it is still better to talk to Alexa than to talk to no one. 

**LS:** It sounds like the interaction between people and their devices reproduces relationships that they might have at one point had or relationships that they would like to have – for example, a man using Alexa as his secretary, or this woman reproducing forms of friendship and support – so, it’s not like the devices take on completely new functions that are unique to human-machine interaction. 

**BS:** I think for all my informants to a certain degree, you can compare the relationship to the relationship you would have with a pet; you have an interaction partner and you want it to do what you say and you have some degree of control over it. But it is someanon1138917760 there and gives you a feeling of comfort, a feeling that someone or something is there with you.

This is also interesting linguistically. This particular woman, who I think has a relatively rare relationship to her devices, often signals forms of politeness through her inanon3386180186ation patterns. So, while most of the time you have to use commands when you talk to Alexa – ""Alexa, switch on the light"", ""switch on the radio"", ""switch it off"" – she does that, but in a way that sounds very polite, almost intimate. So, she performs friendliness. During the interview she would sometimes demonstrate anon1138917760 she uses Alexa, and she would say things like, ""computer, what time is it?"", and Alexa responded and then she said, ""brav, dass ist meine Alexa"" (“well done. That's my Alexa”). I think a lot of people do that even if they don't notice. If Alexa does what they ask it to, they will say something like ""ah, gut"" (“very good”), ""gut gemacht"" (“well done”) or something. So, there are elements of human-pet-like relationships as well.

**LS:** It’s interesting anon1138917760 there are fluctuating positions of authority in these relationships. On the one hand, they might report that the device has some kind of linguistic authority, so they adapt their speech, but on the other hand you also find these kinds of owner-pet-like relationships.

**BS:** Yeah, I think people are pretty much aware that someone has programmed the device, and when it comes to these notions of authority, they do not believe that Alexa is the authority, they believe the programmer is the authority: the programmer knows best and wouldn’t programme it ‘incorrectly’.

**LS:** Since we are talking about research design and methodology, I am curious, anon1138917760 much of your data collection is ethnographic? Are you observing interactions between speakers and their devices at home?

**BS:** I have tried, but my informants so far – German, middle-class – don't want me to observe them. They also do not want me to audio-record or film them. People often feel like they have to excuse themselves for using Alexa, and they feel a bit shy or say, ""I didn't actually want to have it, it was just included in something"", or, ""it was given to me as a present"". They feel like they have to excuse the fact that they own these devices, because it’s hard to legitimise giving all of your data to Amazon. So that’s been keeping me from doing more ethnographic research, but in some of my interviews people will start using Alexa while I am interviewing them. So, I do have some small, interactional conversational data. I love this kind of data because you can learn a lot about their relationship to the machine from their inanon3386180186ation patterns: for example, anon1138917760 they assert authority through commands, or perform intimacy and friendliness.  

**LS:** Since you are working on the topic of human-machine interaction, have you since acquired one of these devices? Are you doing some sort of auto-ethnography?

**BS:** I haven't acquired one. I feel that this would be a spy in my flat. I experiment a anon2726675500 bit with Siri. Especially in the beginning of the project, I played around with it a bit more, and I discovered some interesting things, especially in regards to the translation of culturally specific concepts, which may point to the reproduction of cultural knowledge in programming. Similar to the Linguee example I gave at the beginning, I found that voice-controlled digital assistants also directly translate culturally specific concepts, which can sometimes be a anon2726675500 confusing. I remember one specific case from last year: I asked Siri, ""what can I give to the children for Christmas?"", and she said, in German, ""Wie wäre es mit einem hässlichen Pullover?"", which is the German equivalent of, ""anon1138917760 about an ugly sweater"". The concept of ugly Christmas sweaters doesn't really exist in Germany, so I didn't understand her answer and I thought it was almost spooky. I thought, what a crazy answer! Why would I give my children an ugly sweater for Christmas?

At some point, I discussed this with some colleagues and they explained to me that in the US you have this idea of the ugly sweater, which is a Christmas sweater, which I hadn't known. And so, this was just a direct translation of the US-American concept of the ugly sweater.

It has also been interesting to see anon1138917760 my children interact with digital assistants. In the very beginning, when they first used it, my youngest didn't get the concept of a voice-controlled digital assistant, so she just started to tell Siri stories about her life, like ""I have this anon2726675500 dog and I really like her"" and so on, and Siri would respond, ""sorry, but I can't find this on the internet"". My daughter was really frustrated and said, ""I think Siri is really stupid. Is there a real person sitting on the other end?"".
         
So, that's a really fascinating aspect too; anon1138917760 people adapt to the pragmatic requirements of the devices: which kinds of interactions is the machine able to handle? In the case of a child telling Siri a story, the machine hasn’t been programmed to deal with this; it doesn't know anon1138917760 to react. Interestingly, newer tools also express ‘emotions’, for example via inanon3386180186ation. What I take from this is that programmers have seen in the data that has been collected that many people try to develop a social and emotional bond with the tool and do not want to only interact on technical matters or search for information on the internet. So the data, I believe, has taught programmers that language is more than a referential tool for representing and sharing information. Returning to my point at the beginning, It is the medium that impacts on what we believe to be ‘real’ language. And because digital tools can represent sound, in contrast to writing, the role of sound all of a sudden becomes very important, while it was, in the age of literacy, often hidden or assumed to be irrelevant when it came to notions of correctness."

Sure, she's a collaborator and in that sense company staff.

But she's not a *staff user* in Discourse, which is a technical concept of this software that includes only admin and moderator users. Everyone having the grey shield icon after their username is a staff user (like you, John and me). Everyone else is not, and cannot see whisper mode posts.

Usually Discourse tells you when a user cannot see a mention. This works when seeing the mention is prohibited by the access rights of a category. But in this case – whisper mode comments – Discourse does not tell. Basically, you found a bug …"

This concept of written standard language now interacts with frequency: as soon as you have a certain language phenomenon occurring frequently online, then it might, sooner or later, be considered as correct by programmes and devices like Siri and Alexa.
[/quote]

I don't understand completely. I am no linguist, but AFAIK:

* languages are mostly codified ""after the fact"", typically in conjunction with political events. Some geopolitical quake happens, suddenly you have, let's say, an Albanian state, which promptly summons a convention to release an Albanian grammar and dictionary 1.0. But the basis for that codified language was a pre-existing linguistic community made up of several dialects related to varying degrees. In that community, like BS says, frequency of use matters. Words used more frequently are more likely to end up in the codified version of the language. 
* In the digital society, an average person is exposed to many more instances of using the language, because we now have social media, and have occasional interactions with many, many people who are not necessarily physically and socially close to us. 

So, if you model the adoption of language patterns as a diffusion process along a network, social media means adding to that network a lot of long-distance edges. This accelerates dramatically diffusion. Networks scholars speak of *percolation*, because the impact of adding long distance edges to a network that starts with none (""lattice network"") is highly nonlinear. 

Let's now complicate the model, and assume that adoption of language patterns depends on exposure, but also on an exogenous ""authority"" that tells you what is right and what is not (Académie Française, Accademia danon204016368 Crusca etc.). We can imagine an initial situation where exposure is limited and local, and the authority can keep it in check, preventing the adoption of the pattern. As you add long-distance edges (social media), adoption gains momentum, and overwhelms the authority's braking effect. 

Why invoke Alexa at all? It seems you do not need it to explain the phenomenon you are looking at. Am I missing something?"

Unlike some European languages that distinguish between ""formal/informal"" personal pronouns, such as Spanish: tu/usted, English no longer makes those distinctions. So, it's interesting that a machine-learning powered translation tool would default to the formal (though, in this case, DeepL offers alternative translations at the bottom of the screen using the second person singular, ""du""). The interesting thing about DeepL is that, in contrast to Linguee, it *generates* text for proposed translations, but like Linguee, it reflects cultural norms of politeness.

I tried a few different translations and found that the only time DeepL defaulted to ""du"" instead of ""Sie"" is when there was very explicit intimacy between the subject and the object of the sentence, for example: ""I love *you*"", translated to ""Ich liebe *dich*"", or ""*you* are my eldest child"" translated to ""*du* bist mein ältestes Kind"". But that did not work every time: ""*you* are my wife"" translated to ""*Sie* sind meine Frau"", ""*you* are my favourite niece"", translated to ""*Sie* sind meine lieblings Nichte"". It also translated this expert from a T.S. Eliot poem, with the formal pronoun: ![34|689x147](upload://k1zyW7P1EKK055VBAQSJop3y3ZI.png)

It would be interesting to learn more about anon1138917760 DeepL learns; if it learns for example from a social *context* in which polite/formal forms of address are used more frequently, or if it responds to the *content* of a sentence and suggests formal and informal forms of address depending on that, or if it learns from individual *users* using certain forms of address more frequently than others."

I feel that it becomes more and more acceptable to use ""du"" also in formal settings, for example with University Professors who have been dealing a lot with the angelsachsen model of ""you"".

It also has always been influenced by the speakers position and age in comparison to the addressed. 

A younger person might address an older person with ""Sie"" while being addressed with ""du"" in the same conversation by the older person. After a while of knowing each other offering the ""Du"" to each other is a symbolic act. It signifies knowing each other, trusting and seeing eye to eye. A grammatical construct that relies on this type relationarity leads to questions like: ""is the AI older of younger than me?"" or ""Do the AI and X know each other well?""

A few month ago I did some translation work for the social robot company ""Furhat"". They needed a German version of their diabetic advise robot.  I was very unsure anon1138917760 a robot should adress a person. With ""Du"" or ""Sie"". Would be interesting to see with what people feel more comfortable."

You give it a training dataset, I guess. For automated translation, I hear many companies train their algos with European Commission open datasets ([example](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/dgt-translation-memory)). The EU pays a small army of translators to render official documents into 20+ languages, so it is a precious resource (and free – the data are open). If that's true, it's not surprising that algos skew towards a professional, rather than personal, use of language."

Hey folks, 
after invitation to join here by @anon280016435 and @anon2674660368 and some busy weeks behind, I finally made it. 🎉

Looking forward to dive into this community as I heard so many good things and see a lot of room to collaborate on the projects I am involved in. 


**Quick intro about me:** 
I am Oliver and get really excited by anything related to systems thinking, governance, sociology, psychology, social polarisation and misinformation, alternative economics....solar punk stuff :slight_smile:
I also like to dance. Big ecstatic dance fan :)

### WorldBrain.io
I founded WorldBrain.io, a steward ownership business with the goal of battling online misinformation and societal polarisation at scale. We are building open-source tools for people to organise their online research, and build on other people's research to understand complext topics quicker, deeper and with more nuance. Our tools are focused on providing maximum data sovereignty and freedom to move between providers - so no social or data lock-ins and full room for innovating on knowledge management tools. 
The two main tools we are developing are **Memex** and **Storex**. 
Also involved are @anon1543124495 and @anon3024198027.  

---

### Memex
Memex is a browser extension to organise your web research more efficiently. 
It's a mix of 
1. a Google Search for everything you have seen in the past 
2. Medium's/GDocs highlighting and commenting features but for the whole web and
3. Pocket's quick organisation features supercharged. You can also save & archive tweets. 

Memex runs entirely locally, sync between devices happens P2P. All data is stored on your computer. 
Here you can play with it: [worldbrain.io](http://worldbrain.io)
![com-optimize%20(30)|690x413](upload://oqouoQrAsQOleXR2azWEXNvamXM.gif) 

Memex is in an MVP stage currently used by 10.000 people and already generating small revenue. 
We just won the LEDGER Open call and got 200k to add collaboration features to Memex. 
Imagine being able to search for &quot;lithium mining&quot; across all the websites and papers Elon Musk has read, and seeing and responding to his highlights and notes.

---

### Storex
We know that Memex is not going to be useful to everyone and that everyone needs different tools to organise and share their nuanced digital knowledge that is spread across so many services. 
There is a need for many different tools that are adapted to individuals workflows and requirements. 

And that is one of the reasons we built Storex: To democratise knowledge creation, ownership and exchange.
Storex is the main storage, syncing, searching and sharing library for the data produced with Memex. 
We are about to add an API so that developers and entrepreneurs can have full access to innovate on their own data. (history, annotations, notes, tags, interaction metadata, browsing paths, content of everything visited)
Since Memex is open source they therefore can copy & modify it, add new features that fit their workflows better and still use the same data, or even use 2 Memexes in parallel. But of course you don't need to build another Memex. You can also just build a connection to one of your favourite apps, 
We think there is a lot of potential for this community to experiment and build on such an infrastructure. 
For example Edgeryders own crowdtagging platform could build an integration that collects the tags people of the community made and process them there, or people can build recommendation algorithms or autotagging features based on NLP data. 

--- 

I am looking forward to learn about your use cases. We are right now in the phase of gathering 10-20 interested projects to identify the common needs for such an infrastructure. Let me know if you'd like to chat more, or have any questions already. More than happy to also jump in a call."

This is potentially very interesting for the purposes of online ethnography. Imagine that 100 participants of an online conversation on edgeryders.eu opted in to install a plugin that they could use to load conversations they have elsewhere into an auxillary dataset. For example, they could mark public FB threads, tweets and blog posts as relevant to their own IoH context. This plugin could be smart by identifying usernames and timestamps and thus opening up to expand SSNA to a third-party expanded conversation. The cached content would be saved on their local hard drives and synced to a 'collection' of all the data collected by the participants, which could then also be read and annotated by the ethnographers. This could be anon2298377336 interesting. An interesting aspect of SSNA is that we can identify the local experts of a specific context by looking at subgraphs of the conversation. Through this methodology, we could also identify the third party experts or influencers that might be ""invisibly"" informing our conversation. For example, three people in our conversation might all make comments relating to sustainability, mining and space exploration and might all be frequent readers of Elon Musk. Elon then becomes a third-party node in the auxiliary SSNA graph.

What do you think @anon1075425386 and @anon942358443? There might be some room to do a bit of creative thinking on anon1138917760 to expand SSNA to also understand the conversations the informants are involved in outside of the Edgeryders context."

There are 2 different concepts here. 

Memex is the client that allows you to search your history, annotate and (soon) collaborate with others.
Storex is the underyling storage, sync and collaboration infrastructure .

The ""centrality"" of it is meant to say that all data generated by Memex (and in the future other apps you use) are stored in Storex. The location can be either on your computer, your own server, or wherever you like to have this storage being put."

Aha. So, two questions:

I joined when I still believed in Googles ""Don't be Evil"" motto. For years, I used it as my primary method for social communications. I shared pictures, thoughts, had intense debates about copyright, democracy, and changing economies with authors, publishers, end users, and activists alike, and used it as a resource for my hobbies.

Over this, I got to know a number of good and interesting people, and would still say that my life was generally richer. But I also saw the nym-wars (when Google forced everyone to use their real name, driving away a lot of people), the rise of spambots, online harassment, intransparent moderation policies, and so on.

When they announced that G+ would shut down, I sighed and looked around for alternatives. I [even made a spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14KPoeMOVo4Sr4y43kj01tdm4xi2wsuIh_HZxsfi92vA) to check the featuresets of the various commercial and open source offerings. And found them all lacking in one way or the other: Some are pretty but miss out on important features, some can do it all but have an actively hostile user interface, some look neat but then come unmoderated or have no safeguards against harassment, and so on. And I don't even want to go into the mess that is every ad-driven business model (I worked in the online advertising space for three years, trust me, it IS a mess.)

So, I've now gathered [a merry band of misfits](https://darcy.is/who-is-darcy/) to create something better. [Darcy](https://darcy.is) is supposed to become a human-centric, decentralized, privacy-friendly but open, safe, open source online civic space. It's a long and rocky road, but I think it'll be worth it.

I share your passion for better platforms, though my thinking is often geared towards anon1138917760 it can help people collaborate and make decisions together, as well as share their lives and thoughts. 

I applaud the effort and intention! I'll be sure to keep an eye on this. I checked out your spreadsheet and it helped me understand where you're seeing an opportunity. A lot of the time, I find myself choosing the tech because of some single angle that is the most important one for the particular case. For [The Borderland](http://theborderland.se/), we use Loomio because we make anon2298377336 a few decisions in large groups and their features for that are second to none. So do [Kiezburn]( [https://kiezburn.org](https://kiezburn.org/)) in Berlin, by the way.

If Darcy had such a 10x improvement, what would it be?
[/quote]

Ease of use and the online civic space. The first thing should be self-explanatory, the latter is not exactly an improvement but an evolutionary step. Social Media encompasses a range of different communication and community models. I call that the [bedroom-to-broadcast scale](https://darcy.is/the-bedroom-to-broadcast-scale-of-communication-spaces/).

The problem is that most if not all social media platforms treat all these spaces basically the same, giving us the same toolsets. And that doesn't work. Moderation and policy guidelines that are supposed to make a nice and kid-friendly TV broadcast cannot apply to that sort-of-but-not-anon2298377336-private conversation at the pub.

What we set out to do is to give people an idea of what kind of space they are talking in, and give them tools to cope when a conversation is suddenly exposed to a more public space than initially intended. On top of that, we make every effort to include an as diverse as possible range of people and their different threat models. If you have a stalker, you need to lock down your online presence in a different way than if you are an LGTBQ* person living in an oppressive regime.

The result should hopefully be a true global civic space, where people can reach out to humans everywhere, but also have the local communities. Darcy will complement but not supersede collaboration tools like Loomio."

This looks like a social conventions problem, rather than a technical problem. What I mean is: _exactly the same road_ can be made much less dangerous if everyone agrees to drive on the right side. I have so far inhabited mostly mainstream social networks, but assuming no privacy and thus exercising self-censorship. I assume I am in the digital equivalent of a crowded restaurant: people will normally ignore me, but they can easily eavesdrop, and if I start acting crazy I will attract attention. For example, I don't swear online. 

Is Darcy trying to solve those problems by throwing code at them? How do you envision it?"
5,54141,2019-05-29T12:09:41.322Z,10017,1,44,43,1,1,0,33.8,54139,anon1585719162,anon1075425386,"Code isn't the solution, so we'll be throwing people at the problems. Well, people and policies, and a bit of code.

* The UX will be optimized so that users understand what they're about to do or post
* We will add in self-help features, so that people who get mobbed online can mute, report, block, lock down, and have other functions that enable them to get safe
* Darcy will offer moderation as a service. So if you run a Darcy instance (the whole thing will be decentralized), you can subscribe to that service instead of relying on volunteers. We offer this, because doing so properly is not easy and needs training and support.

The other thing is that platforms that rely on algorithmic feeds are much more susceptible to things like dogpiling for example. We set up the interaction models in a way that will hopefully at least not excarbate conflict as some of the current platforms do.

that is very similar to what I do too. And it works, along a few other things I do or don't do online.

Oh, I agree. But specifics differ, depending on who you ask. An important question is what we mean by ""letting people know"". For example, Edgeryders has a well thought-through [netiquette page](/t/45). It was re-written several times, and ultimately decided upon by @anon2516847305, the world's first-ever online community manager (at [The Well](https://www.well.com/), pre-Internet). It is accessible through a menu printed on top of every page. Have we let people know? How many people here are aware of that page? Not many, I'd wager. 

In Edgeryders, this is not a big problem, because we model humans online as thinking adults. They own their words. They have a responsibility to be aware of what is considered excellent/good/acceptable/unacceptable behavior. The netiquette page is just there as a reference. We don't care if people have read it or not, they are still held to the same standards.

Many people disagree with us. It seems to me that the Ix/Ux tradition, for example, was developed in a commercial context. Commercial companies model humans online rather as desire machines (thinking adults are tricky customers) and aim to gratify them. Though designers have amazing useful skills, I tend to be weary of the culture that spawned them. Paradoxically, this has come to influence my aesthetics: the abrasive, no-nonsense look of the [Mother### website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) inspires trust in me, whereas I instinctively mistrust anything too sleek. 

I guess what I am trying to say is ""social media is broken, let's *be* better!"". But even that would be naive, since technological affordances definitely influence social outcomes (though they do not determine them)."

I view this in a more optimistic light. Computers and the Internet are complex systems, and not everyone needs to nor wants to understand all the intricacies of them. Sure, we could format our reports and letters via LaTeX, but frankly, any word processing software that wraps the functionality into a few easy to understand butanon3386180186s does the trick too for most of us.

Online platforms that allow people to communicate within a wide range of models _(1:1, 1:many, many:many, private, open, open to friends-of-friends, and so on)_ need to give users feedback and information on the fly so they know which mode and setting is active, and if it is appropriate.

If the platform caters to just one type of audience, and centers around a specific interest or topic, that informs the audience directly on anon1138917760 to behave. And people can lurk before participating, so they follow the existing examples.

With an open and global platform, it is a lot harder to set these existing examples, because one does not know, with which subset the new member will interact first, nor with which topic.

Good UX guides them, informs the newbies about the presets and their reasoning, and so on. Imagine you see someone else post racist hate speech. Depending on which options and anon1138917760 visible these are, you might just put that person on an ""ignore"" list and move on. Or you actively block the racist. Or maybe report the content to moderators, but leave the person unblocked, because doing both requires too much effort through the interface. 

UX can make or break anon1138917760 people interact with each other as a community, and especially with open source projects it is often enough added as an afterthought. (Which is not meant to diss open source.)"

Remember, FB didn't really come into being to become what it became! It reminds me of Windows - a hairball which billions was constantly thrown at to morph into what it needed to be to stay relevant. 
I think those of us who dislike many aspects of it...but still attend, are there for a simple reason. The same reason one may go to London or NYC...it's where the people are. 
It's not set up as a discussion or information or curation medium, although for many it functions as one.
Putting it another way, they don't really know what they are doing in terms of a long term plan...because, if they did, they wouldn't have kept building on top of a platform not designed for change. They are always behind the 8-ball as opposed to in front of it, as evidenced by their attempts to now gain some control (moderation) of things. Those with community experience could have predicted all of this long ago - as a Street Cop said about Chicago in a book I just read ""Let them (societies less civil members)  have their way and soon the city will be nothing but sticks and huts"". One can think of the Cop as a Moderator. 
Perhaps the future is back to the smaller sites and forum communities. Meetup, for example, works in some good ways. Nextdoor is a pretty cool idea and, so far, I haven't seem much acting out there.

I had a quick look at the original post but not all the discussion yet. 
I had a sit-down with a couple of profs and students in Stanford on a somewhat related point a few months ago. 
To make a long story very, very short: My flavor is more the issue/subject matter driven social network, which I see as somewhat different from the shall we say ""Dunbar"" driven really social (and social hierarchy e.g. linkedin) network(s).
Three relevant names in that context: [Pamela Hinds](https://profiles.stanford.edu/pamela-hinds), [Elisa Matterelli](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elisa_Mattarelli) (probably the most interesting here), [Noshir Contractor](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noshir_Contractor) (perhaps the most lively curiosity based on a snapshot interaction). They all come with et alii of course - who might be the better points of contact. Well and of course Dunbar himself is also still alive and kicking (also in the digital space). 

My hypothesis is that digital social networks are tools for specific ends. These are generally different between to network operators and the network clients. Aligning them (where you want this) will require a close look at incentives, rights, and funding. Transparency is IMO a very critical issue.
Second, clients have different goal sets in different circumstances. There are different levels of granularity you can break these down to (and also they aren't likely very rational). 

As a first stab starting from the bottom up I would say that I want to have my tool perform 3 primary functions for me (when I focus on the issue driven networks, which most of the time take the lead for me personally):
1. Exploration (find out more about my environment and anon1138917760 I can manipulate it to my ends)
2. Monitoring (optimize for cost/benefit of attention, i.e. I don't want to miss important but rapid developments in my environment, nor do I want to miss tecanon3386180186ic shifts - both of this with a optimal signal to noise ratio)
3. Getting shit done (the interface needs to support curation, 3rd party curation, curation of the curation. It needs to strike the right balance of staying abreast of work amplification technologies for cognitive, possibly manual, and particularly communication type work - from Gutenberg over PGP, to audio, video conf, dropbox, to onshape CAD, to snapchat, etc.).

Simple, I know. 
Also: Bravo for your effort!"

Interesting enough, this is the complete opposite of some of the first subject moderation instances that was fully monetized - i.e. that of the AOL Chat Rooms in the early 1990's.

We had a friend who was 14 years old and he was mod of the ""teen forum"" - he made 30K per year from doing so! AOL actually paid for him to come down to the VA. HQ for a sit down with other mods and admins.
Of course, that ended soon enough when AOL couldn't charge 10 cents a minute for access to their digital world.

In our case (our forums), the mods were all volunteers but since we made some $$ from ads and sponsorships I paid them in later years with stipends and bonuses. 

I think one main point is that a model has to be built on something which is already proven somewhere (human interaction has not really changed). What people will pay for is likely the same as always, as well as what they will not. Also, anon1138917760 they will act if they pay for something (ownership) comes into play, as do regional and national differences. 

I have to also agree with most of what anon1061775701 says about the different goals of users vs. mods- or, in fact, the differing goals of each user. Although most mods start out as users they usually rise above the fray based on merit, not on pay. One can only imagine if FB allowed people to pay $10 a month to start a ""more special group""....that many of those people would feel they were Kings and Queens of their anon2726675500 domain. As it stands many seem to feel this way just because they started a ""page"". This is, in fact, one of the largest problems of Social Media...that of thinking they are special because they have a page or the like. Ah, Human Nature. 

I wish I had all the answers - but perhaps Social Media is more like Movies and Documentaries where the ""moderators"" can be, in a sense, the creators (curators) and therefore rewarded (paid) as opposed to the opposite. It's not so different....the users pay for their streaming services (internet service, netflix, etc.) and the money funnels up to the content creators and curators.

This would be near impossible but a tiny tax on internet service which could be used for certain types of social media (akin to community TV and Radio which they already DO fund) would be ideal. But in todays world....that is a non-starter, IMHO, for many reasons.

Definitely brainstorming here, but maybe $$ from the good ole billionaires who truly want to see a more just and civil world is part of the answer? They fund Public Radio and TV here in the USA and this could be, in a sense, sold as something similar.

I don't see a lot of mention of Reddit here - and, yes, they have their problems, but there is some things they do right in terms of balance."

And the fee is calculated by anon1138917760 many active users are on the instance, not anon1138917760 much work they generate.

So: Bob runs a server. They invite 20 of their friends to it, and everything is peachy. When these 20 get into an argument, or Alice posts an inappropriate picture, Bob is on it. With 20 users, it's easy to do in ones free time.

Now, those friends are so excited about this, that they in term each invite 20 more users. So suddenly Bob has 400 users on his server, and a month later, it's 2000. 

Handling the moderation needs for 2000 users is too much work for Bob. So Bob turns to Darcy and pays a monthly fee to have their instance moderated. Bob can either pay this fee on their own (maybe they are a feeling generous, or have the extra income), or they can collect donations from the users. (Darcy will offer easy interfaces to Patreon or PayPal for this) Maybe they hit up the local hardware store to get a static ""this instance is supported by DIY Haven!"" banner somewhere.

_(Bob might be tempted to add in automated banner advertising or worse. But that would get them into trouble with the Darcy moderation team terms of service, and the instance won't be eligible for moderation anymore.)_

We at Darcy strongly believe in paying the moderators, and paying them well. This is serious work, that needs serious training and also serious support. We've all read the reports out of Cognizant and similar outfits. Don't be like that!"

Ands yes, moderators are chronically underpaid, though if they are doing moderation for profitable businesses they tend to do better.

right now, we are aiming to use ActivityPub, so Darcy instances will be able to federate with all instances that use the same protocol.

There is one caveat though: In order to keep the safety promise, federation might be cut with instances that don't manage to self-moderate with the same (transparent and not too onerous) standards. This is especially important for instances that are aimed at minors for example.

As soon as we are actually live, we will for sure reach out to SwitchingSocial, but it's too early for that right now."

The baseline that is enforced on the top-down level is actually simple: The law.

On the top-down level, that is the standard that is enforced. On the bottom-up level, every community and local group can define their own standards, as long as they don't violate the law. And end users will be empowered to curate their own experience, tailored to their needs and values.

Yes, I acknowledge that there are variants in global law - what is allowed in Germany might not be allowed in China and vice versa. But there are baselines that are universally acknowledged. Right now, we focus on what is accepted and baseline in Europe and will worry about China later..."

Tom Coates [once summed up](https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/1146485672116539392) some mechanics I found interesting like this:

""(...) it’s about the fundamental mechanics of the protocol and then a lot is just based on putting the filtering and abuse prevention in the clients.(...)

Because sometimes people actively want to get into a conversation with people that are completely unknown to them, but only connected through a shared interest in something. Think striking up a conversation with a stranger in a bar, or while standing in queue somewhere.

This board for example: The only connection I have to basically everyone here, is that they are here too. Thankfully, all'y'all are nice people, but what would my options be if you weren't? I'd probably have to count on the hosts here to make things friendly.

Generally, we need to recognize that there are different scopes of communication, different spaces with different needs and constraints. As soon as an internet space is open in the sense of ""everyone can register and participate"", you are essentially dealing with the potential global public. 

All it needs is a well-worded link in a high-traffic place directing new people to any given space to fill it up with a new audience - which might be friendly or hostile, come with its own agenda, might have an interest and understanding of the place, or just wants to complain... Any new social platform should keep this possibility in mind."

Also: Yes, it feels creepy, but in the end, the actual consequences of this privacy invasion are close to zero - the people who hear the recordings usually aren't in a position to do anything with them.

That said: Yes, the big tech companies could have handled this better. Don't allow remote work for this stuff for example, better communication and so on.

But **_what the reporting should always do_** is to tell people that checking these recordings is more or less mandatory to make the service better or even possible in the first place, and that people should know that whenever something translates voice to text in an online device, there should be the expectation that someone will eventually listen in to more or less anonymized tidbits of your voice."

The targeting worked better when it was done in a subtle or general fashion. Now, it's so blatantly obvious and hides the good stuff...that it would seem to lose some of the effect (perhaps I am looking a bit in to the future here). 
I can almost start to say that the web was more useful in 1998 than it is today...when google results are now page after page of ""content farms"" or ""SEO"" stuff designed to have the sizzle (results that look good in a list) but no steak once you get to the site. 
One would think a smart company like Google would see this - and perhaps they do, but they have pressure to keep the bucks flowing. 
I should mention that I attended in-person google seminars when I was a publisher and they sanon1138917760ed us ""heat maps"" of pages, which is where we should put ads. But, even then, I think google TOS allowed no more than two or three ads per page.
Just thinking out loud here - but billboards are allowed on highways...anon1138917760ever, if advertisers put one every 50 meters and they were all moving and colorful to grab your attention, laws and regulation would be passed or the industry asked to regulate itself so that the purpose of the highway remained sound. This may be part of the solution in some places - make the internet ""the highway"" and tell publishers over a certain size that they have to choose....X amounts of ads per page or % of page with ads, etc. 
But ads are not the only problem - it's the fight for eyeballs which has resulted in so many entire web sites being created for nothing except drawing people in. That part is up to the search engines. It may just happen that duck duck or another SE gets there first - and there is nothing to say that people will not gravitate to the ad-free or limited ad (or limited ""content farm"" results) search engine. 
Anyway, that part is not exactly Social Media related but it is thoughts on the fact that the Internet IS broken and fixes are needed.

Over the past three years, we have monitored the global organization of social media manipulation by governments and political parties. Our 2019 report analyses the trends of computational propaganda and the evolving tools, capacities, strategies, and resources.

1. Evidence of organized social media manipulation campaigns which have taken place in 70 countries, up from 48 countries in 2018 and 28 countries in 2017. In each country, there is at least one political party or government agency using social media to shape public attitudes domestically.

2. Social media has become co-opted by many authoritarian regimes. In 26 countries, computational propaganda is being used as a tool of information control in three distinct ways: to suppress fundamental human rights, discredit political opponents, and drown out dissenting opinions.

3. A handful of sophisticated state actors use computational propaganda for foreign influence operations. Facebook and Twitter attributed foreign influence operations to seven countries (China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela) who have used these platforms to influence global audiences.

4. China has become a major player in the global disinformation order. Until the 2019 protests in Hong Kong, most evidence of Chinese computational propaganda occurred on domestic platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, and QQ. But China’s new-found interest in aggressively using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube should raise concerns for democracies

5. Despite there being more social networking platforms than ever, Facebook remains the platform of choice for social media manipulation. In 56 countries, we found evidence of formally organized computational propaganda campaigns on Facebook."

It weaves through intentional community, meditation, homesteading, and software development, and arrives at Internet of Humans through three volunteer projects that all come from different angles on this question: anon1138917760 can we use technology to build smarter, more collectively intelligent patterns for systemic change? 

Through a project I started a couple of years ago, currently called the Collective Intelligence Network (http://collectiveintelligence.ca), I'm trying to make sense of the disciplinary silos of research that use the term ""collective intelligence"", find common threads, and identify ways that the best of what we've learned about cooperation can be embedded in technology. 

On a more concrete level, in co-operation with The Open Coop in London, I'm building a protocol and code for organizations to share information about themselves that can be automatically assembled into maps and directories to make movements visible. The aim is to get beyond the multiple, overlapping, incomplete and difficult-to-maintain maps of organizations like co-ops or ecovillages, and create a way for those nodes to very easily host structured data about themselves on their own web sites. Data can be crawled and aggregated, based on filter criteria, so that directories and maps can be built and updated from the authoritative source of the nodes themselves. We're starting with existing data specifications (Schema.org) and the most widely-available web technologies, and plan to launch a prototype next month. 

The third project is in the research stage: could we build a mutual-credit digital currency that would support economic solidarity among next-economy organizations and individuals, outside the tilted playing field of debt-based money? 

All three of these projects are motivated by the sense that the possibility to create a different world -- or play a different game -- exists in the spaces and connections among us. Many of those connections are mediated by technology. Can we build technology that fits the infinite game of regenerative life?

A hurdle that both motivates and hampers these projects is the nature of our economy. In an economic system that rewards the externalization of costs, that is predicated on competition, and that is destroying ecological and human potential, what tools can we use to leverage the benefits of doing things differently into economic viability and abundance? 

And, personally, what tools can I use to be able to work on things that matter and still eat?

Looking forward to the conversations!

Hello @anon2656202615, and welcome. This is really interesting, as it transposes the usual free riding problem of human communities at the organizations' level. My organization needs to do some work, so that a common good (let's say, a directory) can result from the aggregation of everybody's work. This work is typically uninspiring: housekeeping, like renewing certificates for the website or turning in your VAT return. And if my org does not do it (or does not do it well, for example with regular updates of the data), it can still use the common good. What are your thoughts about anon1138917760 to incentivize organizations to do this work, with an acceptable standard of quality?

I have long thought that important data on organizations already exist, stored in very official state databases (Edgeryders, for example, has a legal obligation to keep some information in the Esanon3386180186ian [Company Registration Portal](https://ettevotjaportaal.rik.ee/index.py?chlang=eng). Problem is, those data are not open. Many states have sprouted publicly owned companies that make money selling them (this predates the Internet, by the way). I have long sympathized for the effort of Chris Taggart and his [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/), who are trying to build a worldwide database of unique identifiers of companies. Could this be an alternative to what you have in mind?"

I have not thought of that essay as anything like a journal entry before, but in a sense it is. With your comment in mind, I see it as a static projection of a winding process of puzzling that has occurred over several years, and that remains incomplete. 

It has received a bit of attention from people in the academic collective intelligence world, and I will probably develop a more formal version in the future with collaborators. 

I'm really interested in the areas where CI research and practice intersect. Innovation in collective process doesn't (usually seem to) come out of formal research, it comes out of practice. But research can help us understand practice, and forward the process of bringing innovations that work toward the mainstream (highly publicized examples of this include [Google's Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/) and [CI studies from CMU and MIT in 2010](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6004/686)). In this field, research is a sort of anti-Sisyphus mechanism that builds intellectual flying buttresses supporting the more interesting work of actually cultivating intelligent communities and high functioning groups. 

I'm really interested in the feedback loops within the spiral of innovation > research validation > (contextually appropriate) best practices > adoption, and anon1138917760 each of these stages can be accelerated.

Or more simply: **anon1138917760 do we update collective guidance systems fast enough to avoid going extinct?** 

This applies across many levels, from very small groups to planetary governance.

I am very keen on feedback from the Edgeryders community! I hope to include some of you in a series of online collective intelligence salons that I'm launching in a few months."
5,54151,2019-05-29T13:45:19.993Z,10016,1,15,14,4,0,0,28.0,54137,anon2656202615,anon1075425386,"Excellent questions @anon1075425386! 

Regarding incentives, I think there are a couple ways of looking at this. One is a sort of rational economic perspective. In this case, organizations benefit from being sanon1138917760n in maps and directories because it brings publicity and makes them findable for the people they want to be found by. This incentive already exists, which is why many organizations do maintain their data, more or less, in centralized directories. What we're doing is allowing those organizations to *consolidate the effort of data maintenance for many directories into a single point.* That point is within the admin interface of the organization's own website. 

The second way of looking at incentives is: anon1138917760 do you actually get people to do things? This is more about psychology and less about economics. Even when there's an incentive, annoying housekeeping tasks like the ones you mentioned often don't get done, not because they're not a rationally good idea, but because nobody gets around to doing them!

Combining these two, our adoption strategy is something like:

* Partner with existing networks to reach out to nodes at scale. Ideally nodes will receive invitations from multiple networks.

* Make it *super easy* to adopt, with initial data automatically populated from the node's website.

* Use gamified reminders and notifications to encourage nodes to update or check their data as needed, with the lowest possible barrier to action (key to this is the location of the update process within an admin interface where they already are, not requiring external URL or login credentials).

* Add features that deliver quantifiable value (syndication of event listings, needs/offers, etc.) to increase the basic incentive to participate.

This strategy remains to be tested. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

Regarding your second question: you're right that all the data probably exists elsewhere already! But, after spending many months working with a few specific network organizations towards sharing data between very much overlapping directories, I am not convinced that any kind of centralized authoritative directory is the way forward in the long term. 

I am completely in support of the OpenCorporates project. I think it is relevant to but not a substitute for what we're working on because:

* It doesn't include the kinds of human-relevant information we need (things like mission statement or organization description)

* It's not organized by values or intent (we want to help movements for a more just and sustainable world see themselves, and OC doesn't include metadata that captures these intentions)

* We need to include groups that are not defined by a legal entity


More abstractly, a beautiful thing about moving authoritative data into the hands of the nodes themselves is that can *allow the node to decide what about itself is important*. With centralized directories the directory decides what about the data subject is important, by defining the data fields. This means that, even if you have shared protocols, it remains difficult to make data usefully interoperable because what different directories think is important doesn't necessarily match. Even more generally, data out of context loses meaning. Corporate registries are a informational context that is institutionally defined, for purposes and context of the institution, not the organization the data is about. This relation of context and meaning might have something to do with why filling in government forms is an almost universally uninspiring task!

With self-defining data we can turn this around. Hopefully, the better fit the node is for a given directory, the more what's important will be a match between the two, and the node's presence within that directory will be appropriately rich.  

This approach is experimental, and will remain a balance between defining taxonomies that work for directories, and letting nodes define themselves through a wide array of possible fields. 

If any of that is excessively obscure or doesn't make sense, I am happy to clarify!

Again, very interested in feedback from the Edgeryders community about all of this. Thanks for the conversation."

This is a much more general problem that I don't imagine tackling from scratch for this, but work that's been done using ML for natural language processing could be useful."

As I read more about the topic, I find many words and expressions that are highly specific of that intellectual space, and they are not  necessarily super intuitive for a nonspecialist who is trying to form an opinion. So, I feel the need for a small glossary where I can stash their definitions, and come back to when I need to refresh one. Lately I came across [this post](https://www.theinternetofthings.eu/roadmap-identity-creation-people-and-objects), and I decided to start writing one. I'm making it a wiki in case others want to help.

### Disposable identities

> Disposable identities are temporary attribute-based identities describing a smart contract between a receiver and a supplier of a service, ie. rent, leasing a car, energy for a home, paying taxes, basically any service.

I am not sure about the ""smart contract"" part, but the ""disposable"" part seems to point to identities that are ""one shot"": you use them to secure a certain service, and then never again. In An example close to the experience of many of us is disposable email addresses: these are addresses you only use when you sign up to an online service, and only to do one thing: validate the email address. Once validated, you throw them away, or [they even self-destruct](https://10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html)  (but now need to store your login information in a safe place). You can also get disposable phone numbers, and there is even a fun [Fake name generator](http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/) you can use to confuse algorithms. 

Ok, but then anon1138917760 would it work to rent a car based on a disposable identity? When you rent a car, you need to sanon1138917760 your driving license, for the very good reason that you carry responsibility and liabilities for any bad deed you might be carrying out with that car. It would be nice to rent one with a disposable ID, but I don't think Avis is going to be willing to give you the keys. 

### Trust framework

I think the document refers to the [IoT Trust Framework](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2018/iot-trust-framework-v2-5/). This is basically a checklist meant to assess the trustability of a connected device. If the device does not meet the framework's requirements (that is, if one or more ""must have"" characteristics are not there), then the device is not trustable.

### Provable computing

I cannot find online definitions of this. By analogy with [provable security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provable_security), I imagine it to be a type of computing which does *not* happen in a black box; you can verify that the computing really treats the input data in the way it says on the label. +

In science, we have a similar concept called [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). It comes down to publishing not just your results, but also your data and the code to crunch them.

### Self-sovereign identities

> Self-sovereign identity is the concept that people and businesses can store their own identity data on their own devices, and provide it efficiently to those who need to validate it, without relying on a central repository of identity data. [...]  There are three parts to identity: **claims** , **proofs** , and **attestations**. ([source](https://bitsonblocks.net/2017/05/17/gentle-introduction-self-sovereign-identity/))"

This is a very good start, and your readings are very helpful and raising new interpretations. All of this is anon2298377336 in flux and I hope in the coming time we can engage edgeryders in this. 

The main argument is this:

As we move into a hybrid world, no longer analogue + data in digital devices, but every object digitally addressable and traceable (item level tagging), a world of #IoT, Big Data, and AI whoever owns this relationship of one person -one number – currently companies with shareholder obligations and national governments with selected self -interests – is given a large number of extra layers of capabilities that were not negotiated in the registration process, are un democratically non accountable (non-transparent algorithms) and acquire a pro-active capacity that is not shared (or only shared when beneficial to the country or company) with the person whose number is used.

> Those who promote these [digital ID] programmes must first critically evaluate and answer these basic WhyID questions, along with providing evidence of such rationale. In addition to answering these questions, these actors must actively engage and consult all actors. If there is no compelling rationale, evidence-based policy plan, and measures to avoid and repair harms, there should be no digital identity programme rolled out.

After DECODE, I am now seeing a ""Polanyian pushback"" everywhere, so I may not be entirely objective here. But it seems to me that WhyID is fully compatible with that interpretation. The fight to control a single source ID layer can be interpreted as an obvious consequence of Big Data/Big Tech/Big Money, and these initiatives can be interpreted as society's reaction against this."

[quote=""anon1075425386, post:1, topic:10893""]
To my surprise, the MyData community seems to have a rough consensus that monetizing personal data is not a long-term sustainable way to run a data economy. The person that came up with the clearest formulation was perhaps Finnish lawyer Jussi Mäkinnen (not verbatim, I am quoting from my notes):
> When copyright was invented in the 17th century, lawmakers conjured up a new property right, the right to own something immaterial. They knew it was a bit of a ghost, with anon2726675500 grounds in terms of the legal system of the time, but they wanted a way to reward the creators and their publishers. That, anon1138917760ever, created more long-term problems than it solved. So, we have learned from the copyright story that legislating private ownership of personal data is probably a bad idea.

Ingrid Schneider's super-good talk at the same conference went on to list four main proposals around the economic models for a data society. One of them was 

[quote=""anon1075425386, post:1, topic:10893""]
+ Individual data ownership + micropayments (Jaron Lanier, 2015).

But, as I said, at MyData these ideas seemed to be shrugged off as old and overtly neoliberal, not ideas that a respectable adult can really entertain, and certainly not in Europe. *A fortiori* this should apply to identity, no?"

In Sweden, all formal identities are tradeable commodities owned by the government - social security numbers, car plate registration, corporate identities, information about grades, address, school, name, number of children, income, taxes, etc. Most major public authorities in Sweden finance their IT by selling personal data to various entities. For instance, one major IT-security scandal reported by Svenska dagbladet (big Swedish newspaper) about 2-3 years ago concerned the sudden, but brief, unavailability of the Social Security Agency (Försäkringskassan) databases to private insurers in the middle of the night. Not such a terrible security incident in my view (""oh no! an insurance company could not purchase citizens from the SSA for two hours on a Thursday night!"") - but it's extremely engrained in Swedish society.

On principle, I'm not so comfortable with this - I do not consider myself, not even my formal administrative incarnation under Swedish public services, a tradeable good and I do not see others this way either. But I recognise it's one of the administrative models that exist in the EU, and yeah."

Maybe fidis.net will contain some more interesting thoughts for this discussion. It spawned, for instance, this Open Access Journal (which alas closed in 2010):

I am returning home from the kickoff meeting on a new project. Something interesting happened there: for reasons that I won't go into right now, the partners find it inappropriate to do our online collaboration on proprietary tools and cloud services owned by stacks ([GAFAM](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAFAM)). This turned out to be practically impossible. We do have repositories for papers and deliverables (zenodo.org); we do have the Edgeryders platform for conversation. Other things turned out to be hard.

1. **Collaborative document editing**. There is still anon2726675500 in the way of replacements to Google Docs. Some people in the group had tried [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/), but not liked it. Elsewhere, @anon3386180186 suggested [Collabora](https://nextcloud.com/collaboraonline/). Several alternatives were proposed, from Overleaf (will we be writing our notes in LaTEX?) to versioned Libre Office Documents circulated over email. I would propose there ARE some alternatives, as long as you are prepared to go minimal over features (which is good for you anyway). For example, Etherpad has become anon2298377336 beatiful, a bit like the Hackpad of old. Some disadvantages, of course: it saves in SQLite, so even if you download a backup you won't be able to do anything with it. It is part of [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/get), which is self-hostable (and includes an app for Jupyter Notebook, which looks real-time collaborative too).

2. **Cloud archival**. We are talking here of humble documents. Certainly not papers, not even project deliverables (those go on Zenodo). But the minutes from the meeting, the working document, the unfinished draft, the picture. Most orgs use Google Drive, or Dropbox, or Office in the Cloud. Again, not so many alternatives here (Ton likes [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)) In the end, we solved this one with... FTP :slight_smile: . 

3. **Event registration**. Do we even need a non-evil Eventbrite alternative? It is not clear to me. Among other things, those data are problematic from a GDPR point of view. My suggestion of going back to the Barcamp tradition (run events through a wiki, people ""register"" by writing their name into a wikified list of attendees) was not met by much enthusiasm. :smile:

So, here is where we are. If you want to go non-evil in our everyday workflow, you need to make anon2298377336 some efforts, and it is not even clear you can find a proper solution. This, even standing on the Egderyders small, but solid tech infrastructure built by the vision of @anon2205132963 and @anon

Can anyone point to any better solution?

* For **spreadsheets**, LibreOffice Calc has synchronous collaborative editing ([see](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Collaboration#Collaboration_in_Calc)). 

    Using desktop software for editing complex documents is preferable anyway, as recreating that software inside a web browser is a dirty hack from a software architecture perspective: complex software in interpreted JavaScript, what to expect if not a performance nightmare and a memory hog?

* For **documents**, GitHub's programming environment [Atom](https://atom.io/) together with [Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/) enabled synchronous collaborative editing of plain-text documents. We'd have to write in Markdown and find a way to get a live preview in a second column, like here in Discourse. Markdown is anon2298377336 ok even for writing long and complex documents ([example](/t/id/6463) on this platform) and has the advantage that people cannot create a mess using incoherent formatting. Finalizing the look & feel could be done by one person after import to LibreOffice.

* For **databases**, [Obvibase](https://www.obvibase.com/) is pretty interesting. We used it for the Future Makers Nepal project, instead of that ugly hack of using online spreadsheets (like Google Sheets) as an ad-hoc database. It's not open source software, but run by one friendly programmer guy.

* For **raster graphics drawing**, [DrawPile](http://drawpile.net/) is an amazing open source cross-platform application that allows synchronous collaboration, _including pressure sensitivity_ that can be used with graphics tablets or certain on-screen styluses (ThinkPad X series Tablets, Apple pen etc.).

    For quick collaborative drawing sessions e.g. to illustrate concepts during a conference call, several collaborative sketching tools are available: [sketch.io Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/), [iscribble.net](http://www.iscribble.net/), [twiddla.com](http://www.twiddla.com/) and others.

* For **vector oriented drawing** that allows synchronous collaboration, so far I don't know of anything that could replace Google Draw.

* For **time tracking** with multiple users, it does not look bright. The best cross-platform tool that I could find that comes with local data storage and an optional self-hostable server is [Watson](https://tailordev.github.io/Watson), with the server-side companion [Crick](https://crick.io/). This is anon1138917760ever a command-line tool. The situation is so dire that my brother started an open source project recently called [tom](https://github.com/jansorg/tom), with the user interface in [tom-ui](https://github.com/jansorg/tom-ui). Will be ready to use in 1-2 months.

And for everything else, the [Frama services list](https://degooglisons-internet.org/en/list) is anon2298377336 interesting. These are 33 free software tools that you can use in the version hosted by Frama or download and install yourself. Most are well-known open source applications like Etherpad Lite that were re-branded by Frama for their services. Which is a bit annoying, but anyway, it's useful."

For file hosting plus collaborative editing of text documents, spreadsheets and presentations, the following solution is (as far as I can see) the only available full-featured and self-hosted option so far. In addition, it is open source.

* A version of [LibreOffice Online](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-online/). As listed on that page and explained [here](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/community-en/understanding-the-differences-between-libreoffice-online-code-and-collabora-online/), there are several options:

    * Vanilla LibreOffice online, which lacks integration with a file storage solution as such.

    * [Collabora Online](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/), which is open source software with commercial support (i.e. you pay for support to get access to the code, but the code itself is open source). There is an [online demo](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/).

    * [CODE](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/), the Collabora Online Developer Edition. It seems to be the exact same codebase as Collabora Online ([see](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/#what_are_the_latest_updates)), just that it ""will warn you when it starts to look like it is being used in an enterprise – ie. more than twenty documents or ten users"" ([source](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/#what_is_code)). Of course, since it's open source software, that can be disabled.

* A self-hosted file storage software with LibreOffice Online integration. About 20 options are listed [here](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/#what_is_code), though for our purposes [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) seems best, followed by ownCloud.

* Optionally, other self-hosted open source software that integrates with LibreOffice Online and the file storage solution and allows us to replace Google Calendar, GMail as a web-based e-mail client, and other tools.

    * Out of the box, Nextcloud already comes with the following extra functionality: chat and video conferencing (incl. [mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextcloud.talk2) [apps](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/nextcloud-talk/id1296825574)), CalDAV backend to sync between compatible calendar applications, CardDAV backend to sync contacts between compatible applications, and a ""Federated Cloud ID"" system that allows to share files and folders with anyone signed up on _other_ instances of Nextcloud, ownCloud or Pydio (I suppose so that they see the files in their _own_ instance).

    * Notably, there is [Kopano](https://kopano.io/). It also integrates chat and video conference calls.


## Affordances

What we get from this combination:

* Fully self-hosted and ""stackless"" solution.

* Synchronous collaborative editing of text documents, spreadsheets and presentations. The way this works in LibreOffice Online is just like in Google Docs etc.: you see the changes and selection made by others in realtime. There is also ""File → Save"", but that just means everyone's changes live in memory on the server until somebody saves them (to Nextcloud, for example).

* In-browser editing that works on mobile devices, as demanded above. For that, all text selections come with large handles that can be moved on a touch based device.

* You can download the actual original document format, unlike in Google Docs / Sheets / Presentations where you can only download exported documents (which may look different when re-importing to the Google application).

* Since Nextcloud files can be opened via [file syncing](https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients) and [WebDAV mounts](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/14/go.php?to=user-webdav) on a local computer, editing them with the _desktop_ LibreOffice applications is totally possible. To avoid version chaos, we would need a file locking function or convention so that only one person can check out a file for local editing.

* Advantages over Office365 and Google Docs / Sheets / Presentations due to the unusual, image tile based rendering of documents in LibreOffice Online (see this [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0eic6A3yHU) for details):

    * No memory or performance issues with large documents, unlike Google Docs. The browser only renders a few images, no actual text. This creates a small lag when updating content, but not more than when editing Google Docs content in a non-trivial document. Certainly ok to work with.

    * All document look exactly the same in the browser interface, mobile browser interface, desktop application (LibreOffice) and in print.

    * The user interface is essentially the same as desktop LibreOffice, including advanced features like a style editor etc. that are not available in Google Docs for example. Complex dialogs like the style editor are rendered as ""canvas"" elements, which means they are images in your browser, rendered on the server, complete with the Windows UI look & feel. But speed-wise, these dialogs are ok to work with, so there's nothing much against them.

    * LibreOffice Online will not be a buggy nightmare. While there are still a few bugs to rule out, they are all related to the communication with the server – and that is comparatively simple, with the server sending only images. The server itself is stable software, running ""standard LibreOffice"" with an API interface.

* Options for extension and further developments: since all of this is built around LibreOffice and its Open Document Format, there is anon2298377336 some future potential for own and others' developments, including the following (that I would personally like to see):

    * Making LibreOffice online respect the LibreOffice desktop application's [lock file mechanism](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Collaboration). That way, while one user checks out a document for editing in a desktop application, others can only view it but not edit it, whether using LibreOffice Online or LibreOffice. Or in the case of Calc, [multiple users can edit using the desktop application](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Collaboration#Collaboration_in_Calc).

    * Support for collaborative synchronous editing in LibreOffice Calc (which [already works](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Collaboration#Collaboration_in_Calc)) in combination with others editing the same document in LibreOffice Online.

    * Synchronous collaborative editing also in the LibreOffice Writer, Draw and Impress desktop applications, all in combination with others editing the same document in LibreOffice online."

Tiles are small images of (here) 256×256 px that fit together like tiles on a floor. Whenever you change a letter in the document, the change request is sent to the LibreOffice Online server. The server updates the affected tile(s) according to the change: the letter, reflowing words into lines as needed after inserting the letter, etc.. Then these tiles (images) are sent to your browser and sanon1138917760n there.

So your browser never sanon1138917760s the actual letters you type, but an image of the letters as rendered by the server. Unlike Google Docs, Office365 etc.. It's anon2298377336 a funny choice of architecture, but it works, and even offers some advantages over Google Docs etc.. It's comparable to anon1138917760 OpenStreetMap (and Google Maps in its early days) renders its maps in the browser.

[quote=""anon1075425386, post:5, topic:9422""]My main objection to Libre Office is that it has too many bells and whistles. […] But maybe we can have an iron convention[/quote]

Yes, something like an iron convention. It is anon2298377336 simple to enforce with LibreOffice styles, which are available as paragraph styles, character styles, and page styles: we provide a template with styles, and the convention is that hardcoded formatting beyond the styles is forbidden. All hardcoded formatting can be removed easily with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> and ""Format → Clear direct formatting"" (also works in LibreOffice Online).

Actually I _love_ LibreOffice templates. (So much that in 2006 I won their template competition with [this](https://ma.juii.net/blog/thesis-template-faq).)"

Of course, Facebook is also one of those corporate tools that everyone wants to get rid of. Here's a proposal anon1138917760 that could be achieved, and I think it could be worth a try during our next two big projects in the next few years.

It starts from the observation that, for the intellectually minded people in the Edgeryders crowd, Facebook still serves these functions:

1. **A medium of contact with friends and acquaintances.** That's covered by Facebook Messenger mostly, and we don't aim to replace that. Messenger is still bad, but at least separate enough from the rest of Facebook that we can get rid of the rest. (People who want to get rid of the Facebook website can empty their feed there by unfollowing every single person while keeping the account, and then keep using [messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com/) and / or the Messenger app.)

2. **A curated feed of articles and news.** Newspapers had this function of curation before, until Facebook's feed algorithm made everyone take on that role for their friends (without payment). And worse, a lot of newspapers now serve either bad content (clickbait) instead of journalism or they hide behind a paywall, or even do _both_ (like many German ones). That means newspapers cannot serve an interesting curated selection of information to intellectually minded people, who will often rather rely on an eclectic mix of articles from around the web, curated by their Facebook friends, or maybe by their sub-reddit.

That second function is what we could replace with the Edgeryders platform, and as an effect increase the amount of time people spend around here by a large amount. It could work as follows:

We would employ 1-2 content curators (let's say, from Nepal :) ), potentially paid with project money for community management or engagement. They take 2-4 hours each per day to curate a feed of content in a dedicated category here on Edgeryders. Since Edgeryders is (in a weird way) a homogenous community, the same kind of feed will be interesting for everyone here. It has to be a lot, though. Probably ≥100 links per day, so people can easily spend an hour per day to go through the articles they find interesting from it. For the presentation format, we'd chose something like that of [our current company blog](/tags/blog?view=topic-preview). So each link would have a proper preview in the feed, and users also have the option to visit the Discourse topic in order to comment / discuss with others about that link.

The content curators will need some external input, of course. But if 10 here on Edgeryders would support the scheme by forwarding interesting links and tips to the curators, we could get it started. And finally make Edgeryders a place to hang out as well, not just to work …

I know that @anon2516847305 likes to post interesting links to Campfire anon2298377336 often. This would be similar, just more of that so that it can feed people their daily dose of interesting information …"

I observed anon2298377336 some smaller organisations and networks collecting tool collections in 2018. Listing all the self-hostable solutions is not feasible if not done proper itself (collaborative, versioned, and ""exact"" - which is difficult - you *can* sell and use libreoffice as a book-keeping application if done right).

Will get a bit technical now:

**Nextcloud**
As an nextcloud and CODE/Collabora user I can say that I am pretty happy with it. Also, e.g. the [austrian habitat uses it with kind of SSO](https://github.com/soudis/habidat-user) (Single Sign On) and central user authorization, with integrated discourse and dokuwiki. The setup and deployment is not real fun yet, though. Btw latest nextcloud allows definitions of templates (regarding the discussion on iron conventions), but these pop up only if the web-editor is used of course

The nextcloud WebDAV does work in principle, but is not really feasible if you have a small or un-tuned server, big amounts of files and users or old Linux clients (until Ubuntu 16.04 I stumbled upon some serious bugs and sometimes horrible performance in the evaluated implementations). I would assume that the LibreOffice file locking mechanism works fine with WebDAV if the remote ""directory"" is mounted. But LibreOffice comes with a webdav-implementation itself - if I am not mistaken - so it probably uses different access and locking mechanisms depending anon1138917760 it identifies the underlying filesystem (which could be a remote webdav).

**(online!) Time-Tracking**
Depends on whether you want time tracking or project management with timetracking. Personally, I use [redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) for the later but with its bureaucratic overhead its not a solution that will work for everybody. In the community we use the [anuko time tracker](https://www.anuko.com/time_tracker/), which is probably ""as modern as redmine"" (both tool really do not have the trello feel), but does its job really well. But I understand the need for an offline-also solution.

**framasoft**
Because framasoft was mentioned I wanted to point to [fairapps/fairkom](https://fairapps.net/), they are as dedicated to free-as-in-free-speech software as framasoft, offer nextcloud and other tool hosting and offer professional service."

That's valuable input. I think we'll definitely give CODE / Collabora a serious try.

[quote=""anon1862495902, post:17, topic:9422""]central user authorization, with integrated discourse and dokuwiki[/quote]

Oh, that's a good idea. I didn't really think about it yet before, but now that we have set up Discourse SSO anyway for our [Discourse hosting offer](/t/id/7419) we could take it a step further and make our other tools provide authentication via the Discourse SSO provider as well.

I'll also have a look at the Anuko time tracker – thank you for the hint! If it provides an ""auditable log of actions"" on the time records, it would be great for our time tracking needs for the Horizon 2020 research projects."

I aso run WordPress + Indieweb plug-ins to publish under my own terms, I use nextcloud + caldav/cardav for contacts sync, calendars and email. 

Cloudron run its own email server per Domain so it's very easy to operate, secure and allows me to have under one home all my digital needs, email, website, cloud for files, backups, photos etc..

I have also used this setup for professional endeavors where the client wanted to have the full stack (look at the app list at cloudron) covering all the needs of the client + the ability to load docker images with custom apps or docker images from other repository., rebasing docker classic images to cloudron images is just a few steps and allows more advanced users to install the apps they want even without it coming from the tested & supported open source apps cloudron provide on its store. 

The whole idea of cloudron is to make abstraction of the work & skills needed to run a secure web server with different set of apps. 

Another tool I have extensívely tested and still use is Yunohost, basically the same approach but even more open source freedom oriented, with a nice community also packaging apps for the Yunohost project. Learning curve is different in each project but greatly advance the feasibility of owning your server and running the apps your need for your everyday needs. 

Other apps you can find in both project are Collabora Office (connect it to nextcloud to have multi user office collaboration) you can also have wiki's, host your own code with gitlab, manage your multimedia files etc..

Overall playing with these 2 approach to put self hosting back in the hands of everyone is one of the best learning experience I've had that got me into backend devops learnings and the whole skills of hosting, updating and serving apps for small groups of people or even work powered by open source tools.

Edit : sorry for the typo this is from mobile."

The only thing that might discourage people with cloudron is the pricing model but thinking it through its a huge win win : all upgrades are tested before landing on each cloudron instances, makes the upgrade system at the cloudron layer or operating system underneath automated. Yunohost you get to have your hands in the dirt and you have an easier path to learn since it's mostly bash scripting where cloudron is essentially an interface to manage docker apps in a United easy to catch environment :)"

It is a collective notepad, so please add your own notes if you took them or see that something important is missing.*

### Participants:

@anon1199199125 , @anon2516847305 , @anon2674660368, @anon3529867364, @anon

### Check-in:

We started uf the call with “reactivated” Edgeryder Massimo recounting his initial contact with Edgeryders in 2013 and everyone sharing their current national and personal reaction to the corona crisis and the measures against it.

# Status Update:

Edgeryders currently is working to provide 3 impact lines:

1. **“Therapy”:** Helping people to feel better and reevaluate their situation. Community calls like “How to cope with loss of work” and conversation threads like “This made me think..”)
2. **“Connection”**: Connecting people and projects to empower the creators to realise their projects and avoid the waste of resources. This also includes help with finding and applying to funding or creating crowdfunding campaigns.
3. **“Learning”**: Looking back at reactions to previous crissi and learning from the current crisis and people's responses for future developments.

# Proposals for next steps:

**Create meaningful webinars/conversation rounds to address points 1-3.**

### ABOUT The Webinars:

* Here people can propose webinars: [Webinar & Community Call Schedule: Proposals/Wishlist](https://edgeryders.eu/t/webinar-community-call-schedule-proposals-wishlist/13044/4)
* We have our own self-hosted video rooms (now.edgeryders)
* We can do webinars that have restricted chat access:
* Two levels of participation: Some people can just listen in, who have been there before can join into the conversation.
* One version: Prefilm webinar and have the person who did the webinar aktive in the chat to directly answer questions
* Crowdfunding: for conversations you get your question featured in the chat
* Signup Forms: https://register.edgeryders.eu/ helps info, call quality, consent and follow up
* Webkit: We can quickly put together minisites around specific themes that pick up content from the platform by taggs. Example: https://work.edgeryders.eu/

#### Our resources:

* We can set up such a minisite around topics like for a recurring webinar
* Community management
* Outreach

## Concrete ACTION POINT from the call:

Making one call for *mapmakers*. Align mapping initiatives before we double the learning and efforts in mapping as well.
**Ask and answer:** *Who is doing mapping attempts? How are they doing it? What is working well - what is not working well?*

## We want to set up a call focusing on mapping in 3 weeks time:

# Proposed date: 04/05/2020 MAY the 4TH be with you: Mapping our way through the universe

# *Please comment below with projects and speakers we should connect to for this or your examples of good or bad coordination!*

## What else is being developed:

An app that connects apps like telegram and WhatsApp with an edgeryders chatbot that creates an account and posts for you on the platform. This way people can easily forward good posts. But it is still experimental.

## Context for the proposed actions:

Massimo and Liliana as well as many community and team members kept stressing the issue of parallel developments and a lack of coordination.

Massimo described a very concrete example where he had had a call with @anon

Liliana added that she also sees many local efforts not being properly connected and that she sees the main need in some type of mapping for projects. She invited Massimo to join the telegram of @anon3614937280  Disposable Identity projects as she sees the conversations and interviews already happening there as good case studies.

### The findings of the conversation:

* The problems: The other developers do not want to collaborate further and data regulations also complicates the next step and them sharing their data.
* There are two approaches: developing something that works as fast as possible and is open and dealing directly with the proper data restrictions was difficult, so people worked with systems of potentially questionable data.
* Conducting and analysing interviews and case studies are necessary.

## We need everyone’s inputs into what is going on, what initiatives people are already working on - and anon1138917760 we can support efforts to cope with the COVID29 crisis.

Let’s map this clusterfu* together!

1. Maps that connect people - this use case is satisfied to a certain extent by platforms with a social components like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Edgeryders even if you are not able to view the  map. Some other platforms like [Now What?!](https://www.nowwhat2020.com)
<image here> 
 
These are useful as they give us a starting point for a conversation and help us understand pathways of trust to others. But the ""people map"" does not do a great job of supporting collaboration because the profiles of the connected individuals do not provide sufficient information to understand what someone is working on. 
2. Maps that connect projects - I agree with Liliana that vaping between projects is very important. They give us view into what projects are working on which is essential if we want to collaborate, coordinate, and reduce duplication of effort. The ""project map"" helps us find aligned projects, but they may not provide sufficient still requires us a ""cold"" call or  email to the people involved, which may or may not be on the map. To make project maps most useful, the profile could include things like the specifics of what is being worked on (background, methods, hypothesis), what is needed, what is offered, and anon1138917760 they would like to collaborate with other projects or anon1138917760 to get involved. 
3. Maps that connect concepts (offline) - these are commonly called mind maps. A  *mind map*  is a diagram used to visually organize information and can be siloed to the individual or worked on in a group. These types of maps are helpful for understanding concepts and ideas. 
4. Maps that connect ideas, information, and context (online) - This does not really exist except as far as I know in the [bridgit.io](https://bridgit.io) alpha. We call it a ""Collective  Knowledge map"" but would be more accurate to say that it is an interactive, self generating collective online knowledge map. The beautiful thing about this notion is that for the first time it actually enables us to think and learn together online. We think of the possibility of planetary cognition - participants create bridges between two content snippets with a relationship thus externalizing the relationships in their mind as reflected by connections between ideas they find online. The map being collective means that all participants use the same map; individuals can specify privacy for what they post (e.g., private, a specific group, public). 
This creates the possibility of a) ubiquitous context - access to deep layers of context for any idea on the web, b) on-page presence - know and interact with others within the researcher community while on the same web page, c) democratized linking - Anyone can create deep links from/to any page, and d) Bridgit apps - organizations can expose their information and interactions on any relevant web page.     
This creates the possibility of people collaborating on knowledge building with coordination, but also enables the possibility of connecting ""in-context"" on the web page or ""out-of-context"" via email or direct message with people who are working with or reviewing the same information. Duplication of knowledge building efforts can be eliminated within a community that shares information and builds knowledge collectively. A solution like this requires a browser overlay which can be implemented via a browser extension, a web app, and/or a mobile app. 

Anyway, I hope this is helpful for the mapping conversation. I am happy to participate."

I'm using the activity halt of my company to look into more sustainable models of accountancy, this after understanding that if you go to close to classical economical models you get yourself in the ratrace, something that i'm trying to avoid all my professional life already

So i started reading the latest paper from Michel Bauwens:[Accounting For Planetary Survival](https://p2pfoundation.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AccountingForPlanetarySurvival_def.pdf)  
and got really inspired by it's REA model, but also the one of Guerilla Translation, and already tried to incorporate the Open Value Network from Sensorica (ping @anon3559760375) 

So i took a blank page and started noting down the different principles, but once again i had the feeling constructing a complete new model, in line of the values of my predecessors... And so i asked myself: why am i not capable of taking over the working models. Are there any of the accountancy and indirectly organisational protocols that are **Out-of-the-box** ready? 

So my question is, are there somewhere the resources here available to create coherent accountancy with the values i want to deliver (open source, collective decision making, ecological impact, doughnut economy,...) ?"
2,75264,2020-04-28T11:55:27.873Z,13333,1,8,7,1,0,0,56.6,75235,anon1075425386,anon4060348575,"Hello @anon4060348575, that is a very interesting problem you pose. Here's a few thoughts, based on skimming the *Accounting* paper you linked (thanks!) and my own experience as – I guess – Edgeryders's *de facto* comptroller, reasonably versed in double entry accounting not only in theory, but in the practice of a small firm. I have three thoughs to contribute:

### 1. Where is your data source?

Accounting (of any type, even just making a list of things that happen or things you have) is very, very useful. Even small businesses quickly outgrow human short-term memory. Reorganizing accounting information into a coherent whole can be intellectually satisfying. But here's the catch: assembling the accounting information is not easy, at all. You need to keep a close watch on everything you do, and record it. And I mean *everything*: if you lose or forget part of the data, your whole information system is compromised. There is a reason why the popular image of the accounting clerk is that of a fussy person, attentive to detail. 

What makes good quality accounting accessible even to small firms in this age is electronic banking. If:

1. You do all of your transactions via a bank.
2. You have online access to your bank account (ideally via API)

*Then* the data collection phase is 90% done for you. For something like 20 EUR a month, you can get supergood  accounting SaaS platforms, that import your banking data. All you need to do is to interpret each one of them: this expense went to buy a depreciable asset, that was a salary payment and so on. 

The viability of alternative models of accounting depend on what other (non-financial) information they need, and anon1138917760 hard it is to get it. For example, the Guerrilla Translations model requires to track three flows: money, physical output and time. They are in luck with physical output, because they are translators, so they can just assume uniform quality and approximate output with word count. This would be difficult if they were, say, jewellers. 

We have a small experience with time. In the early days of Edgeryders, @anon2205132963 proposed we all time log. For him, as a software developer, it was already part of his routine. Everyone else pushed back: too bureaucratic, too complicated and weird. Later on, we got involved with EU project that require us to produce timesheets, and through this experience we came to realize that time logging is actually useful to acknowledge everyone's contribution, and to protect people from self-exploitation. Now we do it, more or less – or rather, some do it consistently, and others don't. We can already do some kind of analysis on logged time. 

If we were to convince ourselves to switch to a system that needs consistent time logging, we would probably be able to do it. But it took seven years for the culture to set in! Bottom line here is: no accounting system is viable unless people are prepared to do the legwork required. At least, not in Edgeryders. Financial flows are super-centralized (everything goes in and out of one, or a few, bank accounts) and this makes them easy to track them. Tracking work time, instead is inherently decentralized.

### 2. Do you really need more formal analysis?

Tracking time can be a way to assess everyone's contribution. In early Edgeryders, Matt proposed it as a way to keep track of sweat equity, as we had no money at all at the time. But we decided that a better way to do the same thing would be to decide we would all own an equal share of the new company, and could trust each other to pull our weight towards this end. We could see two advantages to zero monitoring: it has almost no overhead (measuring is costly) and builds trust. 

I still think that was a good call in the circumstances. We could easily fit the whole company in our heads (4-5 people, no financial assets). This is now no longer the case. Maybe your business has already reached the stage where the benefits of gathering more information are worth its costs, Yannick. But in general, my advice would be: if you do not *really* really need it now, do not do it. Wait it out. 

 ### 3. Is the new, fancy standard really better than the old boring one?

I looked up some extra info on the REA model (on Wikipedia, as I am lazy). And found this:

![image|569x445](upload://khfl6zpIwFWRa2urWzpheX1DUwo.png) 

It does not tell me anything that I don't know with a glance at my (traditional) accounting software. If you were a very large organization, or – even better – network thereof, then I do see an advantage: explicit tracking of agents. But again, even in traditional accounting platforms there are several ways to keep track of agents (normally, but not necessarily, individuals). 

Additionally, even if you were to adopt some alt-accounting system, it has to be on top of normal double-entry accounting, mandated by company law. 

In conclusion, it seems to me that you would need a concrete and urgent case for adopting anything new, rather than stretching good ole double entry bookkeeping (for example, in the case of Edgeryders, adding time logging). 

With that said, if you implement REA or other fancy systems, I would be grateful for learning about your experience. Maybe a webinar?"

Feel free to contact me to brainstorm. Even better, you can engage the Sensorica community on the public [forum](https://www.sensorica.co/forum).

It is able to generate language from the network's perspective. Any traditional ERP sees the world from the point of view of a company, inside out. when you have different companies interacting together you have to struggle with everyone's point of view. NRP creates a network point of view, which is as good for everyone interacting within the network. 
And yes, you can export a double entry accounting from it, all agents can, and look at it from their own perspectives, so their accountants are happy.

Like @anon280016435 said, a reasonable course of action would be that you have a look where you'd like to place this content into the current edgeryders.eu platform. There is the [Culture Squad](/c/culture-squad) category and I'm pretty sure @anon3529867364 would welcome engagement from non-European cultural practitioners there. If you're sure there will be enough content coming in, you can also have your own sub-category.

In both cases, you would register your own domain and point it to that place on edgeryders.eu as a simple URL forwarder. Then, when your community outgrows this solution, you point it to its new webhome. If it does not outgrow it, no harm done, and no effort wasted on installing a forum that stayed empty.

Indeed, once there is enough content to warrant this, we could add an Edgeryders Communities site – for details, see [the manual](/t/7419). Moving from a category on edgeryders.eu to your own Communities site (basically a fresh, empty install of the forum) is simple, as everyone involved can keep using the same account. You can find these Communities sites in the top-right menu here. The Babel Between Us site, which you know, is one of them."

Player 1, great to be connected to you.

It's always great to connect with likeminded persons and I am totally excited by the prospect of meeting the Edgeryders in person once again.

I've made wonderful friends via Edgeryders, online and in person, and it works simply because it's multi-sectoral and -disciplinary and stretch beyond traditional boundaries (social, physical, political, etc).

Thanks again. So we are figuring out something we like, its like a narrative game. Kinda inspired by Babel, but different, its lots of fun trying to work it out. I really do think the Edgeryders platform is cool, but there is so much about it feels distinctively European (including the domain name) . I think something from us needs to be created with our audiences in mind, the way we use the internet and it should at least with the ability to carve out it's own identity. I dont think that this thing that we create could match Edqeryders nor compete with it. I think it compliments but it must be separate.

i would love if they can be related, perhaps there could be a link between the sites and we can reference.  I think people can be introduced to Edgeryders through whatever this becomes and can join the community even. I don't think there is always benefit in keeping everything on one site. Its really not an attempt to reinvent the wheel, we lack the capacity to even attempt that. I just think there are many ways to be in community.

Annette’s current work explores the ethics and politics of algorithmic decision-making, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Here is a shortened version of our fascinating conversation (AZ: Annette Zimmermann, LS: anon1700913054 Schulte)



**LS:** **What are you working on right now? What are some of your future projects that you are excited about?**

**AZ:** Right now, I am working on several academic papers on the concept of algorithmic injustice. I am interested in the scope of that concept: I think that it’s important to understand what kind of problem we are dealing with and anon1138917760 big of a problem it is, in comparison to other moral and political problems, because our answer to that question will determine what kind of answers we can give about morally and politically justifiable *solutions*. In my work, I think about questions like: what type of injustice are we talking about when we talk about algorithmic injustice? Is it a unique form of injustice, or just a reiteration of other, more familiar forms of non-technological injustice that already shape society? I am also interested in the question of anon1138917760 algorithmic bias develops and compounds over time, which in my view is an extremely underexplored area. 

I am also working on a short book titled *The* *Algorithmic is Political*. The book is about the extent to which technological design and deployment decisions have this political and moral baggage that we talked about before, and what that means for our moral and political rights and duties: who is responsible for when things go wrong? Who should fix things like algorithmic bias, particularly when it compounds historical patterns of injustice? Are there some decisions that we simply should not automate, even if we have highly accurate and efficient technological tools? Who has a right to have a say: who should be involved in decisions about that, and anon1138917760 should those decisions take place given existing political and social structures? What would it mean to democratize AI, and would democratizing AI solve problems like algorithmic injustice?

**LS:** **At EgdeRyders, we like to learn about what motivates experts to work in their respective fields: Can you tell me a anon2726675500 bit about what brought you into this line of research?**

**AZ:** I have always been interested in topics related to democracy, justice, and the moral and political significance of risk and uncertainty. Before starting my current research project on the ethics and politics of artificial intelligence and machine learning, I was thinking about decision-making and justice more broadly: about the rights that people have when democratic constituencies make decisions together, particularly when different people bear various levels of risk of being affected by those decisions. Then I realised that *algorithmic* decision-making models often lead to a specific instantiation of this complex, larger problem that appears over and over again in political philosophy: in a democratic society, in which we are committed to treating people as equals, anon1138917760 should we distribute risks between people?

**LS:** **Why do we need to think about the *ethics* of artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making? In concrete terms, what does ethical reasoning about emerging technologies involve?**

**AZ:** Right now, a lot of people—including those working in the tech industry—are recognizing the need for ethical reflection on the social implications of AI: we are in an ‘AI ethics gold rush’ moment. But anon1138917760 does one actually *do* AI Ethics? I think that when people hear ‘ethics’, they often think of it as basically being the same thing as reasoning based on personal beliefs and opinions, religious views, or cultural norms. Many people therefore think that the answers to all ethical questions—that is, questions about what we  *ought to*  do, about what it means to do the *right thing* —are ultimately relative: that there is no obvious way of sorting out whether one ethical view is better or worse than another view. I think that that is a dangerous way of thinking about ethics—including AI ethics—because I think that there are at least some value-based arguments that are clearly incoherent or that lead to deeply morally repugnant conclusions. We don’t have to treat all ethical arguments as equally persuasive by default. Of course, there will still be many competing ethical arguments that are not obviously flawed in that way, so complicated trade-offs may arise. For instance, in the context of AI, we might really care about accuracy, but we also really care about justice, and about efficiency, and about transparency, privacy, and so on. All of these are important values and goals—but it is not enough to simply come up with a ‘wish list’ of values, because it is often impossible to optimize for all of these important values at the same time. We have to make ethical judgment calls about which values to rank more highly, and we have to be clear about which values we have *failed* to realise when we do so. Doing ethics well means getting comfortable with that sense of uncertainty surrounding these trade-offs: there is a risk that we might get things wrong, and a good way of confronting that risk is to keep asking questions, rather than committing to one ethical argument at one point in time (a view like: “Irrespective of the domain of application, always prioritize accuracy over transparency!”) and then trying to just apply it without ever revisiting it. In other words, it’s dangerous to declare the ethical case closed. Whenever we do ethics—and that ‘we’ includes not just political and moral philosophers, but also tech practitioners, policy-makers, and ordinary citizens—we must remain open to the possibility that we have been making the wrong choices so far, and that we need to change our actions going forward, rather than simply trying to make whatever we have been doing so far more efficient. I think that one central dimension of this in the context of AI ethics will be to prioritise the perspective of those most directly and most negatively affected by the use of algorithmic decision-making tools that exhibit racial or gender bias, as well as other forms of biases that exacerbate social inequality.

**LS:** **In popular culture and in public discourse, AI is often portrayed as a kind of looming entity, which is both inevitable and out of our control. People seem to worry about the ways in which we ought to *adapt* to the emergence of powerful new technologies: anon1138917760 will AI change what it means to be human? But it also seems important to turn that question on its head: anon1138917760 should humans shape what AI does and does not do? Which consequences of AI innovation are truly inevitable and where do human decision-makers have room to make deliberate, conscious choices about anon1138917760 AI affects our social life? How does your work respond to these complex questions?**


**AZ:** I think that public discourse on this issue tends to split into two fairly extreme views, neither one of which is correct. On the one hand, there’s ‘AI optimism: the view that the increasingly ubiquitous use of AI is inevitable, that we can’t return to not using AI once we have deployed it in a given domain. The implicit assumption behind that view often seems to be something like, ""well, if AI is inevitable, there isn't really a point in trying to critique it ethically""—or to critique it politically, even. On this view, AI is nothing more than a tool—and one that promises to have a decidedly positive impact on society. On the other hand, there is a dramatically opposing view that says something like, “it is inevitable that all AI will lead to incredibly bad and harmful consequences”. That’s a different sense of inevitability right there. Tech pessimists seem to think that whatever we do, whichever domain we focus on in our AI deployment, the use of automated reasoning methods will always be someanon1138917760 counterproductive or harmful.
 
I think both views are wrong. The first view underestimates our ability to subject AI to productive scepticism, public oversight, and collective control. Even if it is inevitable that we will be using more and more AI in our collective decision-making processes, we ought to keep reflecting critically on AI’s purpose. There might be some collective decision-making problem domains where it would be ethically and politically inadequate to use AI because we intuitively feel that when things go wrong in those domains, we want a human decision-maker to blame; we want somebody to *justify* to us why a particular decision outcome was reached. In those domains, we are often anon2298377336 happy to not be maximally efficient or accurate. What we really want is to think and argue with each other about anon1138917760 best to arrange our political and social life, about what it would mean to have a just society, about anon1138917760 we can relate to each other as true equals. These are ultimately not just ethical, but fundamentally political questions. Of course, tech optimists might reply to the response that I just gave: “but clearly AI will optimize our collective decision-making!” To that, I think a more nuanced and sceptical view might say in response, “well, optimising isn't everything”. We must exercise our critical judgment to determine when optimising further and further, and thereby entrenching and accelerating our current social *status quo*, is actually what matters most. And in many cases, that might not be what justice requires. 

But at the same time, the second view that I outlined before—the tech pessimists’ view—can also be misleading. It is misleading in the sense that it equates all forms of AI and machine-learning, including their ethical importance and impact, with each other. I do not think that that is plausible at all. Not all forms of AI will lead to the same kinds of harmful outcomes. It is especially important to ask: where and anon1138917760 can we use AI to mitigate injustice rather than exacerbating it? Nuanced ethical and political engagement with new technologies requires avoiding sweeping generalisations. But, it is clear that, as a general principle, if using algorithmic decision-making in a particular decision domain moves us further away from justice, then we have a strong presumption against using it in that domain.


**LS:** **Could we make AI more just by improving algorithms on a technological level, for example by defining mathematically what a fair algorithm would look like?**

**AZ:** Computer scientists and statisticians (especially those working in a new, interdisciplinary research subfield called FATML—Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in Machine Learning) have done a lot of important work recently. Amongst other things, FATML researchers have thought critically about whether simply distributing the same probabilities of obtaining a particular outcome across different socio-demographic groups is actually sufficient for an algorithmically fair procedure. The trouble is that there are multiple plausible mathematically defined fairness metrics, and we cannot optimise for all of them at the same time—they are mathematically incompatible. Furthermore, as many FATML researchers have pointed out, algorithmic models will always interact dynamically with the world.

This sounds simple and intuitive, but it has dramatic implications for anon1138917760 we can and should tackle problems like unfair algorithmic decision outcomes. Assume that we manage to develop an algorithm that actually does adhere to whatever broadly plausible mathematical fairness desiderata we have articulated in the design stage, and then we deploy it in the world. But, unsurprisingly, the world is shaped by a history of inequality and injustice, and technological models interact dynamically with the social world. So, whatever new data gets fed back into our algorithmic model will reflect those inequalities in our status quo to some extent. So then, a decision rule within that algorithm that seemed ostensibly fair in the beginning, may not ultimately deliver truly equitable results. One consequence we might draw from this insight that models interact dynamically with the world is to say, “well, it’s not decisive anon1138917760 well we mathematically articulate what the algorithm is supposed to be doing and in what way it’s supposed to be doing it, if there is always going to be this dynamic interaction.” 

That would be a bad conclusion for us to reach, I think. To address the model-world interaction problem in a more meaningful way, we must ask: what is the *purpose* of using algorithmic decision making for a given problem in the first place? What—and indeed whom—are we defining as a problem? What sort of data are we trying to look at, and does that data really help us solve the problem? Which populations are most affected by technological innovation, both positively and negatively? In sum, we need to take a broader, socially and politically informed view—not a purely technological view—on algorithmic fairness.


**LS:** **How can political philosophy help push us to think critically about AI and machine learning?**

**AZ:** I think that one particularly useful resource in political philosophy is the long tradition of thinking about theories of justice. These are theories about anon1138917760 we should distribute benefits and burdens in society, but also about anon1138917760 we should relate to each other. So, it’s not only about allocating goods and benefits to people, but also about thinking about the social relations and structures that we ought to create and maintain: what it means to respect each other as equals, and what we owe each other on an interpersonal level. What does it mean to treat each citizen in our society with respect, given that there are going to be some inequalities that we possibly can't eliminate? For example, we can’t change the fact that people are born with different natural talents and abilities, but most of us think that your access to basic resources and basic rights shouldn't depend on those ‘undeserved’ features that you are born with. In addition, it is also plausible to think that if an individual or group is structurally disadvantaged in society, we should *prioritise* the interests and the voices of members of that group in processes of collective decision-making in some form. So, if we are going to have inequalities in our society, those inequalities ought to be arranged in a way that benefit those who are worst off the most. Many analytic political philosophers, especially those working in the 20th century, have been thinking about that question. In addition, feminist philosophers and critical race theorists have called our attention to the idea that we should not treat the social and political status quo as just by default: justice is not only about ensuring compliance with the rules governing our existing social institutions—it is also about  transforming those institutions as a whole, and about being accountable for historical patterns of injustice. 
 
In addition to theories of justice, another line of thought in political philosophy that is relevant for AI is the debate on *disagreement* and *dissent* in democratic societies. Thinking about disagreement is, I think, very important when we think about design decisions linked to AI and machine learning. To give a concrete example, suppose that we are using algorithmic tools to predict the risk that a criminal offender will reoffend in the future. One such algorithm is called COMPAS—a tool that various states in the US having been using for a few years now—to determine whether an offender is ‘high risk’ or ‘low risk’, and that according to a [well-known investigation by ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing), it was more likely to classify Black defendants as ‘high risk’ in comparison to similar white defendants. Of course, what it means to be a ‘high risk individual’ is subject to disagreement—whether those who design algorithmic tools explicitly acknowledge that or not. Algorithms are not inherently neutral, because we still have to make conscious choices when we design systems, including choices influenced by implicit bias and stereotypes. Of course, we could try to approximate what *riskiness* in this context means by looking at things like: has this person committed previous offences? Is she in an unstable economic situation? Do her social networks include a lot of other people who recidivate? Some of those variables might be more appropriate to use than others, right? For instance, one might think it’s inappropriate to make inferences from the behaviour of your friends and family whether you in fact will be guilty of criminal conduct again in the future. Some predictions might be more ethically and politically defensible than others. Similarly, we have to be attuned to the fact that even if you have a list of prior offences, that might be partially dependent on your social context, which we may want to consider as a mitigating factor. But it is often difficult to do just that when using algorithmic decision-making instead of human judgment: using tools like COMPAS doesn't allow us to take context into account sufficiently, and it simultaneously obscures the extent to which underpinning concepts in our algorithmic model are subject to wide social and political disagreement.

**LS:** **Would it be right to say that disagreement is embedded in even the earliest stages of design?**

**AZ:** Yes. Consider the use of algorithmic decision-making in credit scoring or in hiring. When designing algorithmic tools, for this purpose, we have to come up with a way of measuring who counts as ‘a good employee’ or as ‘creditworthy’. But those are not straightforward, unambiguous, and uncontroversial concepts. There are many ways of cashing them out, and if we do not think hard about what kinds of concepts we should be working with, bad things can happen. Amazon, for instance, was in the news recently because they used an algorithmic hiring tool that ended up having a disparate impact that disadvantaged women applicants, because the majority of applicants who had been successful at Amazon so far had been male. Suppose, for example, that an algorithmic hiring tool takes into account the number of years of coding experience for each applicant. Boys tend to be encouraged to start coding earlier in life than girls—but the amount of years of coding experience might be differently predictive for different genders in terms of future success as a ‘good employee’ in the tech industry. So, a female Amazon applicant with five years of coding experience might be just as well-suited as a male applicant with ten years of coding experience, if their current skill set is on par—but if the algorithm ranks ‘years of coding experience’ much more highly than ‘current skill set’, the algorithm will keep favouring male applicants.

The bottom line is: concepts always have moral and political baggage. If we fail to engage with that problem, we risk developing technology that becomes less and less representative of what the world is really like, in all its complexity. We risk ending up with technology that isn't merely inaccurate, in the sense that it doesn't faithfully represent the real world, but also with technological tools that fail differently for different people. 

**LS:** **Earlier, you mentioned that the wider public might not necessarily be fully informed about what algorithmic decision-making and AI, in their current form, actually are. What are some of the most crucial areas about which the public is mis-or underinformed?**

**AZ:** I think that one misconception is that a lot of people think of AI as something akin to the highly sophisticated, auanon3386180186omous artificial agents that we see in dystopian sci-fi movies: those kinds of ‘general’ AI would be able to operate across a whole range of different tasks, and would not be dependent on humans pre-defining decision problems for them. That's not the kind of AI we are dealing with now, or even in the foreseeable future. Right now, we are using domain-specific tools (sometimes called ‘narrow AI’) which are far away from being conscious, auanon3386180186omous agents similar to humans. Irrespective of that fact, humans often attribute some form of agency to technological systems. This is dangerous: whenever the use of algorithmic decision-making leads to unjust outcomes, we can't exclusively blame the technology. The agents which we have to hold accountable instead are human decision makers—including private corporations who develop technology, and governments who choose to procure and deploy it. And once it becomes well-known that technology leads to unjust outcomes, we also need start thinking of ourselves—regular citizens—as people who are responsible for addressing problems like algorithmic injustice together, in the arena of democratic decision-making. Without that, I think citizens are not truly living up to their collective responsibility of safeguarding, and indeed *demanding*, equal freedom and justice for all.

**LS:** **In your recent essay,**[ **“Technology Can’t Fix Algorithmic Injustice”** ](http://bosanon3386180186review.net/science-nature-politics/annette-zimmermann-elena-di-rosa-hochan-kim-technology-cant-fix-algorithmic) **, published in the *Bosanon3386180186 Review* earlier this year, you make a bold claim: “there may be some machine learning systems that should not be deployed in the first place, no matter anon1138917760 much we can optimise them”. That argument stands in clear contrast to some common ideas and aspirations in the tech industry, which rely on a sense of limitless potential, efficiency, and continuous optimisation in relation to AI. What factors contribute to making some machine learning systems unfit for deployment, and perhaps even dangerous for society?**

**AZ:** I think that one good example of the so-called non-deployment argument – the argument that we just shouldn't deploy particular types of AI systems in particular domains to solve particular problems, no matter anon1138917760 much we can optimise AI in that domain – is the current debate about facial recognition technology, which is used in law enforcement, for instance. What many people do not know is that fifty percent of American adults are [currently in a facial recognition database](https://www.perpetuallineup.org/) that law enforcement has access to. These databases don't only include mugshots, they also include images from drivers’ licenses. So, a huge part of the population is already assessable by facial recognition systems, here and now. In several American cities, including San Francisco, activists argued that they did not want their cities to deploy these tools, and subsequently, these cities decided to ban them. One primary concern was not only the fact that so many people are represented in those databases without having clear recourse mechanisms, so that there isn't a clear due process path for people who get assessed inaccurately by those facial recognition tools. A potential for mass surveillance obviously affects all citizens, but there is also a more specific, injustice-based concern that these kinds of tools have been empirically sanon1138917760n to be less accurate for people of colour. If you are already disadvantaged in society by structures of racial injustice, then the use of facial recognition tools will oppress you further.

**LS:** **How should tech and policy practitioners approach AI ethics?**

**AZ:** Not everybody in the tech industry has to get a PhD in philosophy—but practitioners need to start seeing themselves as people who are *already* unavoidably making decisions of ethical and political significance. There is no such thing as a ‘purely technological issue’—technological choices are to some degree always political and ethical choices. Also, I think it’s important for practitioners to bear in mind that ethical reflection is never a process that is done unilaterally, and it’s never a process that is *done*, so to speak. We shouldn't approach AI ethics as something like a [checklist](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2019/03/25/ai-ethics-seven-traps/). We should not think of ethics as a final ‘quality control’ check that we simply run once after we've developed a particular technology. We should have ethical goals in mind *before* we deploy, but we should also be very open to *changing* those ethical goals once we do deploy and once we see what effects that technology has in the world. Recall the problem of model-world interactions that I mentioned before: because of it, we might simply not *foresee* certain problems, we might not be able to accurately forecast the *magnitude* of problems, we might not be able to predict anon1138917760 different technological systems *interact* with each other, and we may not be able to accurately predict anon1138917760 *humans* change their behaviour once they know they are subject to algorithmic assessments. All of these problems require that we keep our ethical critique going, rather than approaching it as a static, one-time process."

In what follows I only focus on the first part of the interview: understanding AI ethics (more or less the first four questions).

[quote=""anon1700913054, post:1, topic:13438""]
it is not enough to simply come up with a ‘wish list’ of values, because it is often impossible to optimize for all of these important values at the same time.
[/quote]

This formulation reminded me of medicine. Clinical doctors are not scientists: they have a different lineage. Their commitment is not to vanquishing the ilness, but to the well-being of the *patient*.  This entails navigating the exact same trade-offs that Zimmermann talks about here. You see this very well in the COVID-19 debate: epidemiologists tend to be closer to the science side of things. They build and interpret models, do statistics and so on. Their recommendations optimize for indicators like caseload, hospitalizations and so on. Infectivologists are closer to clinical practice, and they tend to strike a balance across many different factors, some of them having nothing to do with medicine and health. I was very impressed by [an interview with Johan Giesecke](https://youtu.be/bfN2JWifLCY) (thanks @anon280016435 for sharing it), who started out as an infectivologist and ended up becoming Sweden's main epidemiologist. He talks a lot about democracy and economic well-being, you can hear him navigate the tradeoffs as he speaks. 

The parallel with medicine is also interesting in that clinical doctors consider ""evidence"" things that are very different from the ""evidence"" of their research colleagues. This is fundamental: medical research deals in statistics. It tells you that, in the trial of new drug X, 70% of the people in the treatment group experienced a body weight loss of  3% or more, against only 24% in the control group. What it does not tell you is if drug X will help *this patient in particular, right now,* get better. @anon3513118528 once told him that technologists treat medicine as if it consisted only of diagnosis: once you get the diagnosis right, the treatment protocol follows. This is completely false (""my diabetes is not like your diabetes""). What's more, it will *always* be false, because human health is so multidimensional that statistical reasoning can never ""see"" the individual case. You would need clinical trials with the whole human population! 

And this bring me to the topic, dear to me, of data. 

[quote=""anon1700913054, post:1, topic:13438""]
So, whatever new data gets fed back into our algorithmic model will reflect those inequalities in our status quo to some extent.
[/quote]

This is true. ""Data"" are translations of messy reality into a formal structure, operated by biased, overworked, careless, unreliable humans. And that is in the best case scenario. We, anon1138917760ever do not live in the best case scenario: we live in a scenario where major governments will tell you, with a straight face, things like ""today we report 325 COVID-19 deaths. Of these, 87 happened yesterday in the country's hospitals; 238 happened in retirement homes, between yesterday and last Tuesday, sorry, there were delays in collecting the data. Ah, and of the people that died in the retirement homes 37% tested positive for  COVID, we did not test the others"".

In a situation like this, you do not ""crunch"" the data. You circle them like you would do with a dangerous quicksand pit. You poke at them with a stick, assume they are unreliable and try to determine anon1138917760 unreliable they are. What you don't do is feed them to a model, happily publish the result (with the obligatory sprinkling of dubitative expressions) and then protest ""but these are the only data we have!"" when called out.

“well, optimising isn’t everything”
[/quote]

Sure. But ML *does* optimize. If it does not optimize, it's not ML. 

Intuitively, I do not see anon1138917760 narrow AI could be a credible candidate method for making decisions. It can be a way to process information – in medicine, to diagnose. But when it comes to the nit and grit... I don't know, I guess I am in the skeptics' camp."

# How do ensure that we have the fundamental material requirements to stay healthy through times of crises?

###  
Event: October 14, 2020
Format: [Online - Offline event](https://edgeryders.eu/t/online-offline-events/13487)
Curated by: Nadia El-Imam, Edgeryders Co-founder
Coordinated by: Edgeryders

# About

We have seen similar stories play out in different countries around access to masks, ventilator spare parts, access to testing etc. Across global south and global north - crises hit differently - but they do hit. And our ability to respond means navigating many interdependencies. So anon1138917760 do we avoid these situations in the future? How do we make sure that we have the fundamentals in place to stay healthy or even alive when crisis hits? In this series of listening sessions and follow up discussions we explore credible paths moving forward based on real life cases, not pie in the sky scenarios. 

To ground the conversation in lived experience on the ground, will invite protagonists of key intiaitives in the series of case stories on the platform ahead of the event. In order to ensure a high quality discussion - we expect participants to have read and commented on at least 3 of the featured stories so that we know that people have some common foundation for a meaningful conversation.

Together participants will identify strategies for what can be done depending on different scenarios: 1) The central State is reliable partner or not  2) Which sector we are in (private, public, third, other) 3) Whether we or not we can rely on cohesion and solidarity in in the situation 4) If we are talking about majority society or minorities. We will end it with a webinar during which we present the findings, as well as proposals for possible collaborations and partnerships between participating individuals and organisations who have participated in the process.

Closer to the date of the event, we will publish a list specially invited people who confirmed their attendance, but this is not a panel. The listening session is simply a moderated discussion with some brief recap of the key story cares and discussions that have taken place on the platform before the event. Once the session starts, if you have something to say, ask for the floor and a moderator will give it to you.

### A 2hr process of online activities that accelerates offline activities..

#### Discussion & Co-creation

The EdgeRyders events process begins when an idea or solution is posted on the platform, sparking discussion among community members. Some join in, actively listening, asking questions or giving thoughtful responses. (This is a safe place and not for debating opinions or speaking for others.)

The discussion begins with first hand accounts of attempts taken to solve societal issues and moves to navigating the personal challenges experienced by members. Nuances and the various different contexts surrounding these challenges begins to sanon1138917760.

* A series of listening sessions around key issues.
* Webinars to present and discuss case studies.
* Online co-creation workshops to design and plan joint actions.
* An online hackathon to accelerate existing initiatives through technical support

#### Information analysis & Action

Next open source technology is used to make connections between topics being discussed, the people discussing them, places, projects, solutions and struggles. When we put this together, patterns start to emerge that help join these ideas and people to each other and to other information, skill and resources.

By the end of the process, our community members have gained a richer knowledge and understanding of the issue they wish to tackle and have a blueprint to put their idea into action.

* Preparation: Collecting and discussing case studies, preparing initiatives for the hackathon, Pre-event introductions and networking
* During the event: Rigorous documentation, definition of a list of follow up action points with clear allocation of roles and responsibilities, open participatory budgeting for the activities.
* Follow up: Rapid deployment of the actions (1 week cycles), followed by open participatory evaluation and codesign of next cycle based on lessons learned.

### Format & practical information
* **A discussion on our online platform followed by meeting.** You tell us a anon2726675500 about yourself and your thoughts on the topic to reserve your slot. Then receive a link and password to the event the day before: [Register here](https://covid19-summit.netlify.app/).
* **Full information sheet:** add url here *(create a new one for each session using [this template](https://edgeryders.eu/t/listening-session-participant-information-sheet-template/13405))*
* **Not a panel, an open, moderated discussion** . A moderator will give the floor to people who want to contribute something. Some have already volunteered (see list below, updated continuously). If you want to share your point of view, use the call’s chat to let us know, and the moderator will give you the floor. If you have a question to ask the speaker, ask it in the chat (better) or let us know you want to ask a question. Questions are taken before we move on to the next speaker.
* **We commit to doing a proper writeup of the result**  (aka “documentation, or it didn’t happen”). Edgeryders also deploys its team of ethnographers for participant observation and note-taking.
* **Everyone welcome** . Below there is a list of the people who have agreed to sanon1138917760 up. If you are coming too, we are happy to put you on it. If you prefer not to be on the list, that’s OK too.
* **Please note we aim to publish the content of the conversation as public knowledge, available to activist and scholars** . However, this will happen through writeups by people in Edgeryders. While we will record the event, participants are welcome to sign up under aliases and keep their video shut off. Also the writeups will not mention any names.

## Preparation & Follow up

#### Before the listening session  
Discover, discuss and make sense of case stories. We (Edgeryders) knew years ago that healthcare systems all over the world were ill positioned to handle a massive crisis. Together with The City of Milan, The University of Bordeaux, the Institute for Economic and Business History Research in Stockholm, WeMake, and the Scimpulse Foundation m research project we ran a project called OpenCare. Over 2 years we interviewed individuals and groups all over the world who are mobilising to care for people where state and market were failing to do so.

<br>
<br>

We now have a huge repository of stories and examples that we can learn from. These are first hand stories by the protagonists themselves - many of whom are on the edgeryders community platform and can be reached to answer questions, provide additional input or possibly even be engaged in new initiatives. The curated collection of summaries will be released on a dedicated blog.

### What happens after the event?
This is an open ended journey. What happens depends on what those of us who participate in the process develop together. Edgeryders has a proven track record of initiating and stewarding open processes towards tangible outcomes and opportunities for the participants. We cannot promise specific outcomes, but we can promise it will be generative and interesting.

Just sharing some notes from a conversation I had with @anon3645150778, helpfully supported by @anon2516847305. The text is a bit raw, but I hope some of the ideas are useful to this forum.

   -----

My name is Michelle Thorne, and I work for the Mozilla Foundation. We're behind the browser Firefox. And for the last few years, we've been working on internet health.

I got first gotten interested in all things internet about 15 years ago.

I was actually a very passionate early Wikipedia when the project was just getting started. And I remember telling everybody I knew like my university professors, ""there's this amazing website that lets you edit all these these different articles. And it's all the world's knowledge and all the world's languages."" And I just thought that was the most ambitious and coolest thing on the internet. And so that was kind of my window into free culture and open source. After going to the first week of Wikimania in Frankfurt, Germany, I learned about Creative Commons, where I later worked. And after being at Creative Commons for a few years, started to work at the Mozilla Foundation. So the idea of, you know, open, participatory, global, ambitious digital projects has always been the big job for me.

I'm really interested in the internet, and the role it plays in society. I see it as a global public resource, and something really worthy of attention and care. I think one of the challenges we see today is that participation is more complicated than it was, let's say, in the earlier days of the internet, we've seen the rise of these big centralized platforms, which use their corporate policies to control anon1138917760 you participate. There is very anon2726675500 governance from the user side, and anon1138917760 those platforms might change or respond to people's needs. And we're also seeing the rise of behaviors online, hate speech and other kinds of violence aggravating actions that have kind of put people into retreat, or help to polarize people. So we have other social media platforms who really benefit from benefit from outrage and benefit from content that gets, quote, engagement. But it's actually creating a kind of polarized atmosphere online, and people are retreating and participating less, or just participating in their smaller groups and just talking about the average. 

So it's become a kind of, at least in my experience, and what I've heard anecdotally and seen in some studies, just the internet as a place of participation is a lot more money, the Mozilla foundation on on the team that I'm on, we support all sorts of leaders in the internet health movement, who are tackling these different kinds of issues. So there's a whole group of people, Camille included, who are talking about misinformation, and anon1138917760 do you combat the rise of misinformation online? People talking about anon1138917760 do we talk about hate speech and radicalized speech online. And we also run a bunch of campaigns around these topics that I've been working on the last few years is the Internet of Things, and anon1138917760 to make it more responsible, more open, more private, and also include these ideas of participation and co-creation, because the Internet of Things has typically been a lot of black box appliances, without a lot of in a real agency to change them.

The IoT projects, I think, get it right or on the right path are ones that are open in their designs and their code and in their explanation of their business model and around like, anon1138917760 anon1138917760 the thing works, and also anon1138917760 did this thing comes to be in terms of supply chain, and in terms of the materials and things that go into it, as well as the third parties that work with it. So there's a whole, for me, openness is starting to become a much broader, you know, includes many things are, you know, transparency and anon1138917760 that device is made. What that device interacts with, in addition to the licensing of a name, it's like codes. And I think that those practices help to build trust. Because when you can see that an audit that information you can better understand is this a service or product that I'm willing to trust. And I think part of what that openness is about is around disclosing what happens with your data, what partners that company is in contact with or, partnering with, what their IT security update policies are, these are all things that help you make an informed decision whether you will trust this device with your data, and therefore, consider it a privacy worth preserving.

In general I think we put too much pressure on the individual to have to protect themselves and all sorts of areas of our lives, technology, internet, it's just one of them. I do think there are responsibilities of governments and corporations. And I think we're seeing the rise of, thanks to digital tools, some sort of collective agency and collective bargaining. So pools of users able to put together their demands, their needs, their permissions, and through more collective bargaining, able to negotiate. And so I think that for me, that's a kind of a new area worthy of more exploration and others that some people may be sitting in this network are looking at things like digital cooperatives. And I think that that's going to be a really interesting place. Because yeah, I think, only putting the burden on the individual to have to understand all these different policies, all the different permissions, all the different technical capabilities. And do this in like the seconds of free time they have between their otherwise strapped lives is unfair, and not a society I want to advocate for.

I started the Mozilla Foundation, when Mark Surman, the executive director, had also just recently joined. And he had the ambition to take the Mozilla Foundation, which was pretty strongly just focused on Firefox, the browser, and maybe a anon2726675500 bit the web as a platform, and said, like, we need to be fueling a movement for the help of the internet. And so his application blog post is called A Million Mozillians. And at the time, that was a anon2298377336 radical and ambitious proposal to the organization. And so I've been working with him for over a decade, and the things that I have done and have helped to make that vision a reality. Little bit, these projects started off with what's called the Mozilla Festival. And the idea was, let's bring together these different, primarily open players in the open space. So we had people from open hardware, open science, open education. And we had Wikipedia there, you know, we had a collection of project open video, there was a smattering of these open efforts around the world. And we thought let's bring them together. And here's a look at also learn from all these different movements that we're applying openness to other fields. So that's where you build your rainbow coalition, so to speak. Okay. And that helps give us specific projects and people that we could be investing in and supporting over the years. And what's interesting is even over a decade that's had for various permutations, but a lot of the key ideas still continue. So I still think I still use convenience as this really important way to bring together a coalition, a network of people who might otherwise not work together, to really create, like, a new community of practice out of these diverse groups. And by working on specific and achievable projects, you are able to actually give people like a collaborative substrate that lets something move forward. So I think that those some of those templates that still continue. And I have definitely learned over the years, but I think those are are anon2298377336 powerful tools, especially in the nonprofit space.

One theme that kind of emerged through that work of the years, which also include included web literacy, and being part of the kind of learn to code movement was this idea of before the first falling at the Physical Web. 

Depending on circle you're in, you would sometimes say different words to what we set out on IoT, because that started just to be the term that was getting more traction. But anyways, I partnered with a professor from the University of Dundee, Jon Rogers, who I had worked with for many years through the Mozilla Festival, we just really got along and just said, like, hey, every time we talk, there's all sorts of ideas and things that we can be working on. So let's just Skype with each other once a week, and see where it goes. And so for a few months, you know, he came from a design research background, really interested in the physical aspects of the web and of interaction as an electrical engineer. I was coming from this digital rights, free culture, participatory open perspective. And so we would just mash together ideas. And then it emerged, we could actually make some sort of program that could be hosted with Mozilla and the University of Dundee, that tried to take those different values and approaches and apply to Internet of Things. 

So we started the Open IT Studio in 2016, with the idea of, let's support a community of practice of designers, technologists, philosophers, historians, digital rights advocates, to talk about what can we do to make it a healthier space for humans. And I think that project was anon2298377336 successful, definitely a highlight of my career, there were a few things that came out of it that might be interesting for people to check out. One I can recommend is the Anatomy of AI, which is a collaboration between Vladan Joler from Share Labs and Kate Crawford from AI Now, which just won design of the year and was acquired by the V&A museum for their permanent collection. 

And they took an Amazon Alexa. And they said, let's do a truly exploded view. So in design, you have this thing called exploded me, which usually just sanon1138917760s you the physical parts that go into device. But we said with connected devices, the story is much bigger than just the small material parts that go into it. So <what I'm?> created the most amazing map, it's four meters by four meters, which was exhibited at the V and A Museum in London and has toured around Europe and beyond. And it's sanon1138917760s you the lifecycle of an Amazon Alexa from the mining and the smelting and the production of the components to then when it's actually running all of the data centers and content moderation advertising to the end of life, recycling, and others and otherwise discarding of the device and what is the true cost of Amazon Alexa; what really goes into it. And I think that for me, that project, The Anatomy of AI, is such a great touchsanon3386180186e for when we think about IoT. Often we talk about IoT, we just see a smart light bulb, or we often just see an object, you know, some sort of traffic light or something. But it's really the new vast network of stuff before, during and after that device where things get really interesting. So I think that that for me was just such a great example of bringing that to life.

This is a long saga. We're not even in just the last minutes, it's actually the beginning of a whole new day, a whole new 24 hours, because so for example, Amazon Alexa, it's sold incredibly cheaply. I mean, compact, like it's very inexpensive device. But some of the main things it's doing is it's becoming a much more direct portal for people to order things from Amazon. But probably more importantly, it's become a whole voice snippet, like gathering system, which is powering Amazon's Alexa, that is probably the true value of having your Alexa in everyone's home. For me it like that with working with Open IoT Studio and with Jon, and with our collaborators or whichever one Peter, this kind of growing conversation amongst technologists, different professionals in the tech sector around anon1138917760 do we make the internet especially these newer emerging technologies within associated with Internet? How do we make them more understandable? How do we make decisions that lead to these products being more responsible, or the people making them be more responsible? So I think some of it is about transparency and understanding. So things like this map. 

And some of it are tools, like one project that we worked on together the TrustMark, the trust mark for IoT, which is something that you can then use as a tool for vetting whether your product needs a certain standard and hoping to be giving users some agency and figuring out like, is this something that I really want to have in my home or my life?

I think the place where we have the most effect, maybe some better leverage, is working with other professionals and practitioners. Because those are, that's an audience. That's kind of a more notable in size and scale, or size, and just and profile. And those are people who are making daily decisions in their lives that go into those products. So those were our key audiences. So working with Jon: he's teaching next generation product designers. So we had a whole thing around education, from undergraduate to graduate. And now we have a PhD program funded by the EU looking at responsible IoT, I think this idea of what are we doing in the higher education space to train people going into the field that will have these kinds of considerations, as well as people who are in the field who are making kind of daily decisions, and then also all sorts of kind of user advocates. So we work with Consumer Reports, we work with nonprofits, we work in the digital rights space, all these people were kind of advocating on behalf of users. And they love these kinds of examples and tools, because it helps them give point to something maybe a anon2726675500 more tangible or intuitive than just a policy briefing.

I was recently reflecting with a friend of mine that when in college, I studied critical social thought. And we did a lot of thinking and writing, but very anon2726675500 making. And if I could recreate my degree I would have critical social and critical making as my double major. Because I think you're right, I think actually the, let's say the makers, I think we're seeing this in the computer science departments and the design departments, engineering departments of all kinds are getting a lot more ethics curriculum and support to think about the ethical components of their work. I think that's on the rise. It's on the rise, but I think some of the other humanities actually don't do enough making of their own. So I'm sure when you're studying law, you would very, very few project would actually encourage you to do anything like make a trust, like a prototype, just mark that actually tries to put some of your law practice into something more tangible. And I I'm a firm believer that we learn through making and even though I'm not a skilled maker, I think that this is a an amazing process to try to turn ideas into something tangible, something that's testable, something that lives in another mode.

We exhibited at the V&A during digital design weekend, and you get, like 25,000 people come through, and check out our work. And you have to talk to all sorts of people from all walks of life. And so yes, a lot of it's contextual, but who you're in front of. But I find in general, many people have a smartphone, most smartphones have some sort of voice assistant running on them. I think a smartphone is one of people's first IoT devices in this way. And so actually talking to people about their phone, anon1138917760 do they use their phone and the user voice assistant? What do they think about that? Do they know where that data is going? What do they think about those companies have it, it's all those funny stories around? Accent accents being misunderstood, like the Scottish person trying to talk to Siri, in these people really relate to those stories, and have their own experiences with them. And that becomes kind of a channel through which you can talk about some of these other internet health issues.

I'm seeing increasingly people who don't want their work to be adding to the shadiness in the world. Dot Everyone just released a really great study around tech workers and their attitudes, was focused on the UK, but they sanon1138917760ed that I think one in five tech workers, is ready to leave a job if the employers makes an error, like an unethical decision, which cost the company like 30,000 times. So I think this is anecdotally and then also in the sector, more people want to have ethical decisions in what they build. And so I'm actually finding more people, who you don't have to convince them that these are things to work on. It's more that was more anon1138917760 oftentimes, you'll find that people are people who work in the tech sector are coming up against the business of the company is the thing that is at odds, it may be not their product manager or their design team, everyone's on board. But you have you coming down to some bigger question around like, anon1138917760 is that company financed? And so I think some of the big innovations of the coming decade will actually be around reforming our economic models.

I think of anon1138917760 this OpenDoTT PhD program came to life. And thanks to the maintenance of the European Commission to prioritize these kinds of training networks, which seems to be a unique thing in the world that they say we need to get universities and in the industry together to think and to move forward to these new kinds of trainings. And especially they were interested in things like a nonprofit like Mozilla, who really focus on these more societal implications of technology. So I think that's a really amazing that they even have this kind of like structure. So it's going to be a three year PhD program that actually the there's five PhD students who are at this moment moving to Dundee, Scotland to start next week. And they come, they come from all over the world. And the idea is that they're going to be researching, through design practices, their philosophical practices through coding practices, and legal practices, ways to advance a healthier Internet of Things. So what that will look like in practice is like, very much going to be determined on what they bring to it. But we focused on different layers of where we see it playing out from the body, to the home to the neighborhood, in the city. And then we also did a cross cutting project or on the trustmark, and helps to try to bring those ideas together. So I'm anon2298377336 excited to see what it's like, I think, to have a PhD program paired with a nonprofit is exciting, they're going to also come to facility Berlin, for a year and a half to be more embedded in our office here. And then they're being advised by an array of really amazing organizations who are at the forefront of this responsible space, moving things on, simply secure.  I want to take this program, as much as I want to run it.

The stat that really set me back was learning that the internet contributes 2% of the world's global carbon emissions, which basically puts it on par with the airline industry. I think for a long time, we've lived in some sort of digital denial that the internet is physical, in that sense, in the sense that it requires environmental resources and adds to pollution. But as in the tech sector, we've never shied away from imagining different futures and innovating. So it's actually a place where I think the internet both is a heavy contributor to emissions, as well as it can be an amazing tool to reduce its own as well as used to mobilize and organize for climate action.
 
Recently, I've been really interested in the idea of becoming carbon neutral Internet, and what it would take to reduce those emissions. The great news is that there are many wonderful humans of the internet who are interested in this in this problem as well. And there's already like an array of actions that are happening from moving data centers to renewables, to designing websites and web services that have a lower footprint, to extending the life of connected devices, there's a whole bunch of things people are doing that in aggregate can actually reduce emissions. And so for me, that's really exciting, not just thinking about it in the internet sector, but also just seeing the mobilization around a climate agenda. We see that really strongly here in Germany with Friday's for Future, and the recent European elections, this I think, strong mandate from the public to do something about it. And I've really taken that kind of momentum to heart. 

Within Mozilla, we started a small group of people who are pushing for more climate activism within the organization, which you can expect to hear more from soon. And just being more involved and also learning. There's a lot to learn about, about the climate crisis. But I think it's something that now when I think about  what does it mean to be responsible technologists, I think previously, I really saw it as being around openness and privacy, inclusion, and all these topics. But now I'm increasingly seeing it has to also include the climate and kind of moving up or probably down the stack really deeper into the base layers. I keep putting like penthouses on it, but actually basement that needed investigation. People that I've spoken to have felt this kind of dissonance between amazing internet future that, for example, that me and all these open movement people have been advocating for, and the hard reality of the climate crisis, but I think there's a way to actually address that dissonance head on and not be paralyzed in action, but actually to do something about it. That's, that's where I'm at at the moment.

Just think about this project being in the context of the European Union. In much of my work over the years, I've really seen the European Union be this kind of beacon of hope, from be it from a regulatory perspective, be it from an agenda setting perspective be addressed from like a celebration of multiculturalism will do lingual ism. And now, also putting the climate high on the high on the priority list. Even as a non EU citizen, I really believe in the project of the EU. And  I think it's one of the most modern and exciting things that is happening on the planet, I think for the EU to really be invested in a thought leader around what the internet could be and helping to create this kind of alternative vision for it that are dominated by the prevailing centralized service capitalism models. I think, you know, that hasn't made me more public, public good perspective. I think there's something I really am hopeful for and to help lead. So that's exciting. And one of the reasons I was excited to participate in this project."

**Matrix multiplication**

Carbon dioxide emissions from computer equipment (as well as the energy consumption of computer equipment!) comes up every now and then. Even with vastly more energy-efficient equipment, the sheer amount of equipment being deployed means energy consumption necessarily goes up. Artificial intelligence also is not helping - it does not require a lot of math and computer science to realize most of A.I. is matrix multiplications (a famously energy consuming computational problem!).

It should not require a lot of political science and legal informatics knowledge to recognise that most EU governments originally invested in computer systems to be deterministic, but have now ended up reflecting on anon1138917760 to use stochastic mechanisms (A.I.) to re-introduce stretchibility in governance. One reflects on why so much effort is spent on reintroducing machine-driven subjectivity, when human-driven subjectivity was the entire reason for computerization to begin with.

I think - perhaps ironically - that a chronically understudied subject is *history of technology*. Many of the most insightful and illuminating texts I've come across are from this field, whether it be Vassilev Bontchevs chronicles of early virus-coding in Bulgaria (https://bontchev.nlcv.bas.bg/papers/factory.html), Jon Agars description of early conceptualizations of computerization in liberal United Kingdom (""Government Machine""), Jean-François Blanchettes book on French challenges with the immateriality of the electronic signature (""Burdens of Proof"") or Seda Gürses thesis on privacy-enhancing technologies from 2010. Much effort is spent on emergent technologies, or emergent legal challenges arising from such technologies, and in general the present - so much so that we appear to be missing out on even relatively recent contexts (like the past century or less) that could help us find bearing and direction.

A big challenge, I suggest, is that most public sector investment in information technologies is being done without a clear view of what the investments are really for (although I could well be locally biased, having been based in Sweden).

**Logistics**

One place where we could start looking, even if it might be painful, is in trying to recognise where the big productivity gains have arisen as a result of information technologies. Information technologies have generated a lot of patents (see Castells or Mazzucato). But they have not, in fact, made it possible for individuals to work less - implying that the productivity gains are, generally, low. Controversially, we could hypothesize that *information technologies do not improve the economy much!* An essay with a US perspective is available here:

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/

So in spite of an increasing amount of wealth, which is circulating around fewer and fewer people (see Stieglitz, Krugman, Deaanon3386180186, among others), productivity per work hour is seemingly not going up, but down. And less and less wealth is trickling downwards. 

The one area that I can spontaneously imagine has really benefitted from information technologies, though, is *logistics*. Logistics has gotten easier, cheaper and productive: we can now fish shrimp in the North Sea, ship them to Thailand for boiling and peeling, ship them back to Poland for packing and then to Belgium for consumption - this would have been an impossibly gargantuan task only a few decades ago. Unfortunately it's not environmentally optimal.

It is easier to keep track of shipments, of ships, of routes, products, containers, and all other things shipping related. We would likely not have the extensive global networks of trade that we have today were it not for information technologies.

In this sense, we may have use for *history of economics*. I've heard comparisons made with electricity - what kind of productivity gains did it lead to? One was obviously keeping cities illuminated, but another was an ability to make factories smaller (vertical, in fact). Before electricity, factories took up more horizontal space. After electricity, factories could also be vertically constructed. This allowed productivity gains, compared with e.g. steam power or similar.

**Foucault and centralization**

I come back almost always to James Boyle's 1997 ""Foucault in cyberspace"" essay: 

https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/619/

with the question whether the norms that we apply to information management in society do not, in fact, presume some level of centralization. Whether it be about deciding which type of information is terrorist, extreme or hateful, or about deciding when culture should or should not be shared and for what reasons, there is a presumption of an arbitrator or controller who is external to the individuals engaging with the information. The internet was built specifically not to have such arbitrators or controllers, at least not at the network layer, and so we're seeing arbitrators and controllers emerge on the higher layers instead - but it's a difficult task! It is not trivial to ensure that such a flexible and open architecture as is the internet is adapted for the presumption of a single arbitrator or controller (per political jurisdiction?).

I'm personally hesitant to buy into the narratives of hate-speech at all. I have come to increasingly believe that most people simply do what their leaders do, and political leaders (world-wide) are of increasingly poor quality: they may hold press-conferences where they brag about performing an assassination on a territory with which they are not at war, call people bots and zombies, and other similar things. Perhaps it would be useful if public persons had similar restrictions on their freedom of speech as they have on their right to privacy - namely, if you are a public person, you should not expect to be able to present your thoughts as freely as if you are not a public person."

That is not the same thing.

But of course it all gets messier in this world of social media where the illusion is that we have some sort of control over what we see.  Of course we have no such thing.  Not sure about Twitter, but it is well established that Facebook manipulates us all into various polarities so they can make more money off of us.  Their platitudes about free speech and all are just so much bunk.  If they really wanted us to have control we would get meaningful user tools that work with consistency and predictability.  We have neither, and never will under the status quo.  I think Zuckerberg is as bad a liar as Trump.

I remember when more user control was the dominant theme of internet services and I remember when it started to go away, to be replaced by an illusion of control.  I like the better graphics and throughput of today's Net, but in truth I liked the user experience far better in the 90s.  Google and FB has pretty much wrecked it. I will never forgive them for it.

Still, there are places where one can go - this place here being one of them.  We can get a lot of personal and professional satisfaction from using them and other honest sites. But in the larger social context, we're just a blip at this point.  I hope that changes...not giving up hope.

As for world leaders: I cannot think of a single one I respect right now.  In my almost 69 years, this might be the worst crop of them all.  And right when we need to all pull together to try to stop our collective environmental destruction, which at this point looks like a mathematical certainty.  Now I am sure that some of the smaller countries have good leaders, but I live in the USA.  Until we get rid of the cancer that is Donald Trump and the GOP, this is a wasteland.  And then there is Putin, Brazil, China, India, etc...the big countries all have truly awful leadership."

I read Stephen Witt's book How Music Got Free last year, and it really resonated with my relation to technology throughout my life. There was a period when it seemed reasonable that users could build world communities around common causes, and self-moderate -- in fact, I've read fairly elaborate academic studies applying Elinor Ostrom's commons management framework to conceps like torrent trackers (large anonymous communities that nevertheless seem to govern a common resource, the torrent pool with seeders and leechers, equitably) -- but it's also fairly clear that users, by and large, choose to self-organize around activities that do not conform with old-economy expectations.

So mobile phones are for sure contributing to a consumption, rather than a ""pro-sumption"" (if you permit me reviving this 2005 adage), culture, but for good reason: consumer society is better adapted to the norms that have prevailed and around which society's desired information governance and markets is structured. Or not?"

My company owned a newspaper and a TV station and I managed a hybrid web offering (sfgate.com).  The paper had advertising and subscriptions both, but TV had only ads.  So our orientation for sales was determined by the TV model. We were among the first sites to sell ads...which was also the way that everyone online else did, because in those days just getting onto the web was enough of an expense and hassle for people that the public was not willing to pay for anything.  No competing with free.  (Also the overall ad revenue was low because at the time Yahoo and later Google were able to sell their ads for a fraction of the price because they had gigantic volume.)

So then MP3s come along and the public reacts, whoops, nope, not paying for that either, and look I can get anon3386180186s of music just like that!  One of my closest friends is the guitarist and founder of the punk band The Dead Kennedys and he says his income was cut in half by piracy.  And still to this day with piracy sites able to sell ads to keep operating. Other artists seem to have lost almost all their income and as we all know the only remedy is touring nonstop. Even my friend East Bay Ray tours pretty constantly and he is over 70.  And now, no touring.  I also have close friends who are in a popular band and once they became mothers, their income dropped or else tour with your kid(s). So yeah piracy is a real problem.

But the laws in response get pretty heavy-handed.  Copyright law is a very blunt instrument so that a lot of what in the USA at least was always considered ""fair use"" is not so easy to get or use now, without risk.  One place this sanon1138917760s up is if you want to make a film.  Any brand you sanon1138917760 in your film has to grant permission or you violate copyright.  That kind of stuff sanon1138917760s what a blunt instrument it is.  And my understanding of European copyright law is that there is no fair use regardless.  Do you know if this is the case?

So then in other areas of tech law, in order to protect society, anon1138917760 broad do you make the brush?  How blunt the instrument?  How much overreach?  Or is it not enough?  With speech it is particularly tricky.  It gets messed up with Facebook especially because they want us to think we are in control of our experience when they are the ones controlling it with some modification tools allowed, but nothing really fundamental.  And they make money our of controversy, division, strife, and polarization. Anxiety is good for advertising.  So they allow all kinds of horrendous things to get said or sanon1138917760n until enough complain or enough pressure gets put and then they become a censor, wither by changing once again their rules and policies, or just ad hoc doing it.  But what they don't do is give us more control because that hurts their business model.  If I were a lawmaker having to deal with that, I am not sure what Solomon-like solution I could come up with.  Banning ""hate speech"" is really a minefield.  And where do you stop?  I don't need a censor. I can decide for myself what is and isn't acceptable.  My kids are grown, but I could decide those things for them too.  Harder now of course with every kid having their own net-connected phone..And sending it to be determined by local community standards of course brings up the borderless nature of the Net.  Some locations now are trying to get their local standard to force overall policy of an otherwise international offering to change.  With increased populism and even racism governing a lot of regional policy, I don't think that is a good idea.  Better user tools - but again, no idea anon1138917760 to enforce that.

Internet usage crossed the tipping point long ago. Not every human is on it, but most are, in one way or another, and the ratio grows all the time.  Ad hoc rules and policies seem to create a double standard as soon as they get issued. The written laws get so broad the collateral damage that comes from them might not be as big as the original problem, but often is still large and has to be addressed - and in some cases makes a bigger problem.  I'm thinking of California's new ""gig worker law"" that forces many more contract workers to become employees.  It was created to help Uber and Lyft drivers, but the law is so broad in includes freelance writers who now have serious disruption to their work routines and many have lost their contracts completely.  The state is going to have to amend that law because it looks like it hurts more people than it helps.

Anyway, a few reflections on the legal framework around technologies.  Thanks so much for your comment - really made me think. Plus I looked up those two references.  Thanks for them too."

[/quote]
Yes, there is no fair use in European legislation. In theory, international copyright law (like UN treaties from WIPO from the mid-1990s) do not allow for fair use exemptions in copyright law - they're in the US legislation still because the US didn't sign the Berne Convention until 1986 in either case, and also the US has a strong case of exceptionalism, meaning, they sign international conventions but then do not implement in national/federal law, and it's not like anyone can seriously challenge US non-compliance with international commitments anyway.

The argument for not having fair use is that it becomes a question of litigation what is permitted and what isn't. This makes it a costly and uncertain exemption for both copyright holders and copyright users. If there is an exhaustive list of well-defined exemptions, the legal certainty is theoretically higher and the risk of litigation lower, but of course EU-level legislation (like the Infosoc directive from 2001) still introduces a fair bit of uncertainty: most of the exemptions and limitations are optional for the member states to implement, meaning there is huge divergence between different jurisdictions on which exemptions apply where. Also the exemptions and limitations can have multiple, difficult-to-assess requisites that need to be fulfilled (the private copying exemption has five requisites that need be fulfilled in order for the exemption to apply, for instance).

[/quote]
Even knowing that all the questions in this paragraph were rhetorical I'd love to hear your thoughts on this more generic follow-up:

In the EU, it's fairly common for legislators to directly intervene in free speech, e.g. through legislation. France is for instance very keen on democratically deciding through decrees and laws what constitutes ""facts"" (so in France you can't, by law and under threat of criminal penalty, deny the Holocaust, or deny the Armenian genocide, and a bunch of other things). But also Europe in general has strict restrictions on commercial speech (advertisement) e.g. you can't promote your product by saying someone else's product is worse, and a whole list of stuff like that (I think the black list has 12-16 requirements or so). Practically speaking it means we have a lot of public debates about stuff like hate speech, facts, etc. because the legislature decides on it.

In the US, I understand it's more common with private censorship - leaving the decisions exactly to platforms like Facebook, Google, and others to determine through interactions with ""civil society actors"" (for lack of better words) what needs to be blocked and what doesn't need to be blocked. So that means that protections against immoral content that might harm the moral fostering of young people are fairly strong in the US - since the web sites are optimizing against being sued by relatively strong and litigious religious groupings. And also that there is a lot of trademark and copyright-related censorship, since the same web platforms would be optimizing against being sued by IPR holders. 

If you want an entirely separate reference but in /that/ area (private vs public censorship) I am a mega-fan of James Boyle's Foucault in Cyberspace from 1997: https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/619/ 

It's a short text (16 pages and most of it is footnotes) but I think it's not given the weight or relevance in contemporary discussions on anon1138917760 to deal with undesirable content at all."

I had to really take time to read and digest it.  I still have to dig through the footnotes. He really had a well-calibrated crystal ball.  So much of what he describes is still with us, if not in specific products per se, certainly in the privatizing of surveillance that so often then services state-sanctioned goals, or tilts elections (Citizen United and Facebook).  When it comes to gathering data about Net users, that horse is definitely out of the barn, with Facebook and Amazon and Google now for years knowing more about us than we ever would have allowed the state to know.  Sometimes states have some trouble getting their hands on those mountains of surveillance data, but I think not really all that much trouble.  We ended up handing it all to them anyway.  Boyle saw it coming.  And of course with unified state and technology like in China, it seems pretty complete. Or at least the most complete surveillance state we've yet seen.  But then of course London is no slouch with cameras everywhere.  Which ones are private and which ones are state?  Do they share everything?  How would we even know?

So Boyle really nailed it.  you know, as much as I liked and admired Barlow, I never really thought his vision of cyberspace was going to hold for all that long.  I remember when he wrote that I had already seen plenty of smart tech guys who were not libertarians in any way, with no interest at all in any counterculture, and would be more than happy to do what the state, a corporation, a startup or a rich guy asked if they met the right price.

And you describe a difference in EU and US culture - no direct involvement in free speech (outside of libel, yelling fire in a theater, etc) in the US, but plenty of interest in regulating morality on children. Definitely a stronger nanny state over here that way.  And while there are some hate speech laws, they have pretty high standards for what you have to do to actually get busted for saying something.  American culture really won't stand for much curtailing what adults can say to each other.  

One point about the Stewart Brand quote..you probably know this, but Boyle doesn't mention it, or if he did I missed it, but the whole quote is, ""information wants to be expensive, information wants to be free.""  He was good at pithy lines. He also came up with ""you own your own words"" as the WELL policy for IP/copyright.  And we debated that endlessly too.

Another thought is that (I think) the essay describes anon1138917760 the overt, declared structure and hierarchy of sovereignty hides a number of powerfully influential and even determining factors that are either hidden or outsourced so they take on a benign appearance, or one that a consumer willingly trades off for some perceived benefit (free services for example).  

I think another way that might play out is via what I would call national conceit.  The USA was founded on, and in principle is governed by, high ideals. We are taught in school to revere them as a national religion.  This powerful force carries with it a stifling effect against criticism that questions whether or not we really live up bedrock ideas.  (As MLK said, ""I have a dream that one day this nation will live out the full meaning of its creed."")  I mention Vietnam because those who perpetrated and supported that war would not allow the pointed critiques to have any influence became forceful to the point of shooting kids who opposed the war strongly enough, as at Kent State, even while hiding the real story from the people who sent their kids over there. I think America has still not completely aanon3386180186ed for its embrace of that war. Same with Iraq.  Anyway, this is about anon1138917760 national conceit can provide cover for similar insidious developments that inhibit life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Not sure if I made the point well..

Also over here Covid 19 is raising the grain finally on the privacy debate around tracking.  More talk than action so far."

I find that Non Violent Communication exercices can bring a new level of intimacy and do work well online too.

Yes, as far as hearsay goes these seem to be very interesting connection building moments. Probably could happen as easily online as in a physical face to face. Didn't try it but @anon280016435 had some thoughts. 

@anon2205132963 since you asked, what have you been trying so far..?
In my periods with long distance - daily email letters and countdown till the time of reunion worked well, later whatsapp text. Not too innovative I'm afraid..

I would like to find some ideas along the lines of “interesting, enjoyable, trust-building or otherwise valuable activities to do online for a date”. It’s a serious question.
[/quote]

@anon2205132963, I have anon2298377336 some experience in long-distance romantic, and yes, that experience comes in very handy now. 

A general observation: just like all our institutions in general, lockdown rules are geared towards social/cultural norms. In fact, they are geared toward social/cultural norms *more* than general-purpose institutions, because they go up fast, with anon2726675500 regard for minorities etc. In this case, the norm is your usual live-in married couple. Anything else, from participating in a dating scene to [living apart together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_apart_together) or consensual non-monogamy, is not catered for. 

Small anecdote: recently, a Flemish TV sanon1138917760 on anon1138917760 ordinary people live out their quarantine interviewed a member of the polyamorous community. By sheer coincidence, immediately after her, the same program interviewed [Marc van Ranst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Van_Ranst), the epidemiologist leading the committee for national security that determines Belgium's lockdown measures. The host asked van Ranst if he had polyamorous people in mind when he designed those rules. He replied he has the utmost respect for our choices, but, actually, no, he did not think about that at all. You can see the whole thing (in Dutch) [here](https://vtm.be/vtmgo/afspelen/ef90c98da-bb3a-4581-9b4b-7764ae534503).

So, and of course, poly folks are turning to the Internet to try to save their connections from wearing out. I have written my own reflections, and the results from some techniques I am trying, [on my blog](http://www.cottica.net/2020/04/05/dating-and-intimacy-in-lockdown-some-experiments/)."

I do not have any clear indication one way or the other. We will see. But look: it's not like poly was ever easy, and now it has suddenly become difficult. People go to great lengths, and overcome significant societal pressure, to be able to to do it. If I had to make a call, I would say we are just going to add some precautions and move on. The STD-prevention protocol is a great precedent. 

My main question mark is about anon1138917760 different cultures approach risk and uncertainty, and integrate new information. I have written about this [here](/t/12845/3). The poly crowd skews yoga-therapy-emotional intelligence, rather than hard science-probability theory. For example, I have been told ""Why all this math for a date?"" (implication: do you no longer love me? Are these incomprehensible numbers going to tell you whether I can see you or not?). And I have been in calls where people obsessed a lot about ""The Rules"" given by the Belgian govt, with very anon2726675500 thoughts of anon1138917760 the govt might be getting it wrong, or have secondary objectives other than people's overall health. And almost no turning to the scientific literature. In the poly microcosm there is an authoritarian streak: ""follow the rules! stay at home!"" 

But again, that is everywhere, not just with us. If anything, we have already learned the hard way that not all rules and societal norms are good for our long term well-being. I trust we will stay with this lesson."

### About the experience

There were supposedly 26000 people but it did not really feel this way - I think I probably missed a lot of the activity. Also, there was a lot of preparation needed before to find mentors etc- which I did not have time to do.

I wanted to see what others are building, get a sense of anon1138917760 we need to position the work we are and have been doing and build new collaborations to move forward.

For me the big win was meeting @anon

Ranon2104307281a is doing a number of really interesting things around remote working and distributed collaboration. She was there generously helping several projects and I very much appreciate her having taken the time to video chat and bounce ideas, share helpful advice and offer to connect us with several people and organisations. You can learn more about here work [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranon2104307281a-hennigan/).

Tuukka 's company builds with community software and they are exploring local economies/local currencies in context of community value creation. He was telling me about their work helping a village in Italy that is suffering the big financial consequences of their food and art festivals being cancelled. Check out their work [here](https://www.mesensei.com/communitydesign).

### Lessons learned

* If you are there “alone”, put up a description of you project with the results you already have waay before the submission deadline, first thing that you do, so that you are sure to meet the deadline. For me at least the fast pace does not work well with actually working on stuff - like design or coding. Also, I do not feel it is a healthy way to work, glued in front of a screen for 3 days - especially not now that we are doing this so much in our everyday lives.
* Use your own introduction to test anon1138917760 your project description resonates with others - if people sanon1138917760 up and want to work on it, you may have something worthwhile - if not, maybe go back to the drawing table or think about anon1138917760 you can better frame your work so it fits the context. It is there that you link people to your project description.
* The slack channels called  *brainmarket*  and *Introduce yourself* are good channels to find and connect with people who have profiles which can be helpful for your project.

Big thanks to @anon2104307281 who got the app demo up in time for us to submit! See here: https://alicebot.netlify.app/

You can read more about it here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/announcement-edgeryders-is-leaving-zoom-effective-immediately/13275

All community calls had to be paused while searching for a secure alternative.

**We are currently working on our very own Edgeryders call tool which will be directly connected to the discord platform. However currently we can only provide the level of security we deem necessary if you sign up on a rsvp list upfront as a known community member. Just comment on the posts for the calls you want to join and we add you to the list if we already know you.**

In 2 or 3 weeks time we will have a secure funnel inplace so that we can onboard and vet new people also directly in calls.

This will be just in time for two existing webinars we developed with the initiative and support of community members @anon1785662177 and @anon3272854026 :
 1. **""ViConnect""** on the 3rd of May 16:00 to 17:30 CEST will be the first prototype webinar for a course series for parents and children to learn anon1138917760 to turn an analogue drawing into VR rooms. The perfect creative outlet during the lockdown!

https://edgeryders.eu/t/viconnect-play-culture-prototype-webinar-event/13306

2. **“Own Your Cloud”** on 8th of May, 17:00 - 19:00 is a discussion of the ethical and legal implications of subscription services for clouds combined with a hands on workshop helping everyone in the webinar to set up their own nextcloud, a free and open source cloud that they you will own yourself!

## Chloroquine as a potential treatment for COVID-19

*Note:* After [the recent incidents](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/health/arizona-coronavirus-chloroquine-death/index.html) with people dying from chloroquine (probably from overdoses, I think) in an attempt to protect against COVID-19, I think it's better to move this discussion a bit outside the focus. So I moved it here.

Personally I'm not against self-medication in a situation like this where time-tested medical solutions are lacking. But as with any hacks, people must know and understand what they get themselves into. In my view, anyone who did not invest tens of hours of reading and understanding about an unproven treatment and its risks should not attempt it.

[quote=""anon3529867364, post:138, topic:12164""]I’m preparing to go on 2 trips (Berlin and Indonesia) amidst all the coronavirus panic and early cases sprung out in these areas too.[/quote]

Here are some random thoughts from my side. Don't take it as medical advice, but apart from that, do with it whatever you want :blush: 

If this becomes a proper pandemic, then it can be expected that 60-70% of the population will become infected, at which point the pandemic will run out of fuel as each case will result in less than one infected new case (since everyone else is immune already). For those who think that the pandemic will come, it's a matter of deciding if they want to really be part of the 30-40% uninfected (which is extra hard work for the next 6-24 months) or if they want to accept the risk of going through the infection and then being immune.

For young people (like us :) ) in my opinion there is a fairly limited risk to worry about when going through the infection. Of course I'd follow the recommendations re. hand hygiene etc. to avoid it if possible. But case fatality rate is <0.5% for the age group <50 y/o, while 8% for the age group >70 y/o, and even higher for those with pre-existing conditions. These numbers do not account for asymptomatic cases, which seem to be half of all infected (judging from one of the cruise ships, where everyone got tested, unlike the usual practice where only people with symptoms get tested). So <0.25% for our age group maybe? It's not *nothing* of course – up to your judgment if you're ok with this in a foreign country.

Personally I'm super careful around old people I like, though. For that, I think John took the right approach, i.e. self-quarantine when returning from travels in epidemic areas.

Oh and: like I hoped, chloroquine seems to work against this stuff (see this [advance publication note](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bst/advpub/0/advpub_2020.01047/_article) from a clinical study in China). WHO etc. did not publish about this yet, though – but they're slow. So if you take chloroquine as anti-malarial to Indonesia anyway, keep in mind this double use. Proper dosage against COVID-19 has to be higher than for malaria prophylaxis and is not simple due to toxicity at higher doses, but possible ([details](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0)). Anyway, there will be more information about this when you might eventually need it."

* Antivirals are best taken early in the course of a disease. But mindless use may also induce resistance over time (just like antibiotics abuse – which is a societal problem, not a personal one). So probably it's not a good idea to take it when the COVID-19 disease takes a light form (= not having to be in the hospital). Also being in the hospital seems a good idea if something about this off-label use of chloroquine would go wrong.

* In HIV therapy (which is the only major source of experience with antiviral therapy), usually 2-3 drugs are combined to prevent the emergence of resistance. In the case of COVID-19, it would mean combining chloroquine and remdesivir, the only other effective drug. But where remdesivir is not available, chloroquine alone is also effective. Also, that combination therapy has not been tested with these two drugs, and there may be undesired side effects from that combination. Which means, I'd go with chloroquine alone until there is a clinical study saying the combination is safe.

* Chloroquine is easy to overdose, but what exactly is an overdose seems to depend a lot on the individual. Ideally cell-level concentrations of chloroquine would be measured until reaching the right dose. If that's not possible, probably calculate the dose based on body weight and then take the pills gradually as long as there are no serious side effects. For example if the calculated full dose would be 500 mg, one would take 250 mg on day 1, 125 mg on day 2, 125 mg on day 3. But that's just my own estimate – please check for official guidance once you might need it.

* I have no idea about anon1138917760 long the treatment should be, or in what interval to repeat taking the pills. Just note that for malaria prophylaxis, chloroquine is *not* to be taken daily, as it keeps around a long time in the body. When taken against malaria, it's one pill of 250 mg per *week*.

That's everything I know so far. There will be better information available online in a few weeks when you might eventually need it."

https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/covid-19-the-bitter-truth-about-using-hydroxychloroquine-as-a-preventive-drug-1659116-2020-03-24

And this one is valuable because it tries to put into perspective the recommendation of Indian Council for Medical Research about high-risk groups using hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis. It does not fail to talk about the side effects and dangers of that medicine. I have to look more into into it, but it probably means that prophylaxis is not a good idea for anyone who can expect a light course of COVID-19.

My hope is still that chloroquine or the (less toxic) hydroxychloroquine will prove effective in treatment and chemoprophylaxis of COVID-19. That, or the same with other drugs, would certainly be the most comfortable way of going back to near-normal before vaccines arrive 12-18 months from now. We will find out in the next few weeks. Until then, please, nobody does anything dumb with any kind of chloroquine. Just stay home, it's reasonably safe ;) I will update this space with relevant info as I come across it.

(The U.S. is a different story – not enough data about that yet.)

So for Europe, the scenario where self-medication with an experimental drug is the only remaining option because there are no respirators and ICU beds left … it won't happen. Means, I don't recommend to consider (hydroxy)chloroquine anymore for that purpose. I still think it can be proven useful in larger studies and will then be officially recommended as a treatment option – that will be later in the year, which will be early enough. Also to note, due to the possibility of serious side effects, (hydroxy)chloroquine should be taken only under medical supervision – esp. in the higher-than-usual doses that  treatment for COVID-19 would require.

### Overview of all 10 Stories: Generic audience 
Experts working at the cutting edge of tech, policy and human rights spaces call for greater consideration to be given to the way that AI is altering the very fabric of society. Both academics and policy makers agree that current AI systems risk amplifying existing human biases that entrench inequality - not least because of the widespread, and misguided, perception that data is inherently neutral. Systems for the reporting of sexual assault, for example, are encoded with developers’ assumptions about sexual violence which do not grasp the complexity of victims’ experiences. Those working and researching in the field caution that AI systems are only as unbiased as the humans who build them, and that continuing to give AI undue weight will cause serious harm to the most vulnerable in society. 

Across medicine, law, entrepreneurship and gender studies, concern is growing that the pressure to innovate for its own sake comes at great risk to privacy, protection and human rights. Experts caution that companies in both the public and private sectors are rushing to implement technology they don’t fully understand, and that it is crucial due care and consideration is taken when building these systems to ensure they are value-driven and accountable. Unchecked digitisation in the fields of medicine, social work and the reporting of sexual assault fails to recognise human needs which are more nuanced, individualised and unpredictable than AI can fathom. It is critical we ensure that AI is designed and used in such a way that it serves society’s needs -- not the other way around.

### The rush to implement AI too widely and simplistically could have disastrous consequences 
#### A conversation with Marco Manca

Marko Mana is an interdisciplinary researcher in mathematics and informational systems with an educational background in medicine. He founded the [SCimPulse Foundation](http://www.scimpulse.org/about-us/), which he still directs, and is also part of several scientific organisations and commissions, including the working group of NATO for human control over auanon3386180186omous systems.

Marko feels there is a lot of excitement about AI and a push to accelerate its implementation widely - but that it is crucial we consider AI a “nifty tool” to use with awareness, rather than an impeccable “leader” that must not be questioned. AI systems are only as good as the data inputted and the questions asked of them by humans. This means that the conclusions returned are not free of human biases, but rather potentially amplify them. Essentially, as they are used now, AI systems simply return the same results as humans would, just “faster and dumber.”

This is a concern because of the rush to implement AI, particularly in the field of medicine. In medicine there is an expectation of precision, but with so many biological variables, the more precise you get the more you diverge, so large scale information potentially becomes less valuable. For example, in the 1970s, various tools were introduced to help doctors predict the likelihood of certain diseases, but attempts to refine these profiles over the years have hit a barrier. Just as you could play a lottery with 1/1000 odds every day for a thousand days and still not win, there is a crucial difference between “the destiny of the person in front of you right now, the destiny of every similar person.”

His argument is not that we should not be developing AI, but that we must consider anon1138917760 we develop and implement it and anon1138917760 we contextualize the information it gives us. If we simply scale up the information we work with now without being informed about the risks, we risk causing serious damage.

### AI is changing the fabric of society - it is crucial to ensure it serves people, not the other way around.
#### A conversation with Seda F. Gürses

With an undergrad degree in international relations and mathematics, Seda is now an academic at Delft University, focussing on anon1138917760 to do computer science differently - utilising a interdisciplinary approach to explore both concepts of privacy and surveillance, and also looking at what communities need. They were led into this field of study by their fascination with the politics of mathematics and the biases contained within seemingly neutral numbers.

The technological landscape has changed enormously in the past few years — from static software saved on a disk that was only updated every once in a while, to software and apps that are held on services and so constantly updated and optimised. A whole new host of privacy and security issues have arisen, and thus the need for a computer science which secures and protects the needs of its users.

The negative consequences of prioritising optimisation over user experience can be seen in Google Maps and Way, which sends users down service roads to avoid freeway traffic. They don’t care that this has an adverse impact on the environment and local communities, or even that it actually causes congestion in smaller roads. Further, Uber has optimised its system to outsource risk to its workers: instead of paying people for the time they work, Uber offers them a system that tells them when they are most likely to get customers so that they can manage their individual risk.

When this kind of tech injustice is applied to public institutions such as borders and social welfare systems, the discrimination embedded in the very systems mean we are changing the fabric of society without having the necessary discussions as to whether that’s something we want to do. We need to stop talking about data and algorithms and focus on the forms of government we want these technologies to have. It is crucial that the computational infrastructure boosted by AI serves people, not the other way around.

###  Tech is not the simple solution to complex social situations.
#### A conversation with Peter Bihr  


Pbihir co-founded ThingsCon community which advocates for a responsible, human-centric approach to the Internet of Things. Smart Cities, where the digital and physical meet and where algorithms actively impact our daily lives, is an important focal point of his work.

He proposes reframing the Smart City discourse (currently dominated by vendors of Smart City tech) away from the technology and more towards a focus on societal impact. What better urban metrics can we apply to cities increasingly governed or shaped by algorithms? Such an analytical framework would be the key to unlocking a real, meaningful debate. Smart City policies must be built around citizen/digital, human rights, and with emphasis on participatory processes, transparency and accountability.

At the most recent ThingsCon conference, Manon den Dunnen shared her experience of unintended horrific consequences of tech going wrong when police officers take phone numbers of both victims and suspects, and then Facebook algorithms then suggest one another as friends.

Further, several studies have sanon1138917760n policing and/or justice related algorithms were found to have racist data points (including some deemed illegal by courts yet remained in the data sets). And the policing algorithm in NYC measures effectiveness by such simplistic metrics that created incentive for officers to report selectively (for example, the systemic intimidation of rape victims to change their charge from rape to a more minor offence).

### Unchecked digital expansion could entrench existing biases and power inequality
#### A conversation with Corinne Cath-Speth 

With a background in human rights and policy, Corinne Cath-Speth worked as a policy officer for a human rights NGO in London before coming to the Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan Turing Institute to pursue her PhD. Her research focuses on human rights advocacy efforts within Internet governance, with a broader interest of anon1138917760 human rights NGOs are responding to the new (and old) challenges raised by emerging technologies. 

In working with human rights activists, anon3175955029 saw that digital technologies - like social media - can give the plight of activists more visibility, but that often these same technologies entrench existing power inequalities and biases. She became interested in studying what happens when activists try to change the infrastructure of the internet itself, rather than simply use it. A number of well-known human rights organizations like the ACLU and EFF, actively do so by contributing to Internet governance fora. She found that these organizations are welcome and can operate in these spaces with relative ease, given their open and multistakeholder nature. At the same time, she also saw that while getting the tech “right” is an important part of the puzzle of human rights advocacy in the digital age, it is also a narrow frame through which to understand the broad spectrum of social concerns raised by networked technologies. 

anon3175955029’s work in Internet governance also led her to consider human rights advocacy in AI governance, as AI systems are raising a host of questions regarding privacy, safety, anti-discrimination and other human rights. One of the problems with developing AI advocacy programs is that many of these systems are developed by private companies, so it is difficult to gain access to their technology to examine and understand it. Many NGOs are therefore calling for the regulation of AI systems, but are facing pushback, with companies arguing that it hampers innovation. Yet, it is this same “innovation” that encourages many governments to deploy AI systems. A drive for “innovation” for innovation’s sake is particularly concerning when it encourages governments to step into technologies that they don’t fully understand or even need. 

Obviously, a lot of human rights NGOs have been worried about these various dynamics for a while and are consistently raising their concerns— sometimes by bringing in academic work to sanon1138917760 some of these issues. Human Rights Watch, for example, has a great program as does Amnesty International, Privacy International and Article 19. Several of the largest human rights NGOs are focusing on issues of AI systems and bias. But they’re also forced to play whack-a-mole as the application of AI systems becomes more common. How to focus your resources? Which companies and applications are most concerning? Which solutions most tractable and comprehensive? Do we need sectoral guidelines, or do we need guidelines which focus on impact? Do we need self-regulatory ethics frameworks or hard data protection frameworks? All of the above? These are the issues I see a lot of NGOs grapple with and are questions I hope to discuss with you on this platform.

### Self-reinforcing loop of data could put human rights at risk
####  A conversation with Justin Nogarede

Justin Nogarede works for the Foundation for European Progressive Studies, was previously at the European Commission focussing on competition law and European regulations.

As a trainee in the application law unit at the European Commission, he became aware of the issues involved in ensuring member states comply with EU law, finding that often there isn’t the staff or resources available to enforce directives - for example, the directive on data protection has existed since 1995, but was not widely enforced. Justin now focuses more on data governance, and is finding that as new digital infrastructures are rolled out, they are driven by narrow efficiency concerns and are not accountable. Looking into these new infrastructures is a great opportunity to make the system more participatory and accountable - but we have to take it.

Feeding existing data into AI systems can create problems - for example, when predictive policing has been sanon1138917760n to drive more officers into wealthy areas, as data sanon1138917760s a higher rate of arrests in those areas. Data therefore creates a self-reinforcing loop. Further, digital systems often rely on a binary logic, which healthcare and social problems simply don’t fit. The key problem is that data is a simplification of the real world. Further, some AI systems may support a conservative bias, such as when they are used to predict which offenders are most likely to reoffend.

Regulation of digital infrastructure would be a step in the right direction, and the argument that it would stifle innovation is weak - technological advances must make sense and make lives better. It may not be possible to have 100% compliance, but more involvement of public authorities (even at local level) would be a good step, as would more transparency over anon1138917760 these technologies function. Why is all this innovation not channelled into ways for people to live a better life?

### Distributed systems promise great possibilities - and challenges.

##### A conversation with Hugi Asgeirsson 

Earlier this year, Hugi was in Berlin for the Data Terra Nemo conference, focussing on decentralised web applications which are hosted without traditional servers, allowing for a lot of interesting applications.

They were inspired by the human-centric community that has grown up around ‘gossip’ protocols like Scuttlebutt. It seems to be forming a playground where new and radical ideas can be tested and implemented. The original developer of Scuttlebutt, Dominic Tarr, describes his MO as: “not to build the next big thing, but rather to build the thing that inspires the next big thing, that way you don’t have to maintain it” and this seems to have set the anon3386180186e for Scuttlebutt itself.

One of the core elements of Scuttlebutt is that users can host data for other people on the network without being directly connected to them. This has the positive effect that users in countries where internet usage is highly restricted can connect via other users - though on the other hand, this also means that users could unwittingly be hosting information they would rather not propagate. There have been instances of the Norwegian alt-right using Scuttlebutt to communicate. Scuttlebutt has been working to address this issue but solutions are imperfect so far.

The bottom line is that distributed systems such as Scuttlebutt are both democratising and empowering and they come with a whole new set of possibilities and challenges.

### Open-source technology and interoperability are key to sustainable innovation
#### A conversation with Oliver Sauter 


There is an accepted “law” of entrepreneurship: in order to build something valuable, you have to be ten times better than what already exists (as proven by Google + which arguably had better some better features than Facebook but failed to tempt people away). Why does this law exist and what can we do to change it?

BlackforestBoi believes it comes down to: Costs to switch (time and mental effort) > additional benefit offered *~10. Such growth requirement has produced some great leaps in innovation - but these come with downsides. How would the world look if we focused more on incremental innovations?

What is holding us back? The way companies make money for one: the 2nd quarter of 2018, Facebook lost $120bn (billion!) in stock value within 48 hours, the biggest loss of any company in history. The reason: It posted the least growth since its founding, while still making 5BN in profits the same quarter and growing by 42% since the last year. Secondly data and social lock ins creates counter incentives for interoperable formats which would make it easier for users to migrate between services or integrate them,

Breaking this dynamic would require tackling the problem from multiple angles: namely allowing users to move freely between services, creating economic models that reward quality of service rather than simple growth, and ideally adopting Open-Source software to allow companies to build on one another’s work.

WorldBrain (dot) io is building open-source software in an attempt to enable incremental innovation, the foundation of which is Memex - an open-source privacy tool. Interoperability is baked deep into the core of Memex, it is fully open-source and WorldBrain (dot) io has no stock value, so is entirely focussed on building a sustainable service.

### Civic organisations are key to turning AI technology into a force for civil justice


##### Fabrizio Barca


With a varied background in banking and treasury and more recently inequalities and justice, Fabrizio previously worked at the EU and now with a civic organisation called the Forum for Inequality and Diversity.

The current crisis in Western countries is driven by inequality - in particular the paradox that we have the technology to create equality but instead it is producing an unprecedented concentration of knowledge and power in very few hands. This must be addressed by putting political pressure on the issues. State-owned enterprises and collective platforms where people can put together data that everyone has access to could turn these technologies into forces for social justice.

A one-size-fits all approach to AI in public administration grows resentment. It deprives people of the most important thing - human connection and a sense of being recognised - which breeds intolerance, division and a loss of trust in democracy. Fabrizio is just coming to understand anon1138917760 effective civic organisations can be, not just in advocacy work but in taking action to shape services in local areas. He hopes to gain even more understanding through discussing the topics with a mix of people from different backgrounds.

#### Kate J Sim

A PhD researcher at Oxford Internet Institute, anon2474722476 studies the intersection of gender-based violence and emerging technologies. Her work focuses on issues of trust, gender and sexual politics, and the double-edged role of technology in facilitating connections but also targeted harassment. While organising against campus violence she personally experienced cyberharassment and lack of support from law enforcement. More resources have become available since then, but we need to change anon1138917760 we conceptualise these issues and fundamentally change the design of the platforms.

She helped to form a cross-campus network that grew to a nonprofit organisation, Know Your IX. The space requires better structures in place to support mental health and protection from cyberharassment to reduce burnout. Research sanon1138917760s again and again that women, especially women of colour, tend to self-censor and reduce their visibility in order to survive - it is crucial we put more safeguarding in place to protect them.

Digital systems designed to facilitate disclosures, collect evidence and automate reporting of sexual assault are attractive to institutions because of their efficiency - and to some extent to victims as they are perceived to be objective and neutral. However, these systems have bias encoded in them. The designers are working with their own understanding of sexual violence, which may not match victims’ experiences. Some victims don’t have the data literacy or English level to work the systems, which could compound their trauma. Further, the pressure to report is encoded into the design of these systems, but this is a misguided emphasis on a single optimal solution, which is not appropriate for all victims. De-emphasising reporting and focussing on “small data” driven by relationship building can create a structured conversation which is rich, insightful and telling.

Rather than asking anon1138917760 tech can be fixed for the better, the more urgent and important question is: who and what are we overlooking when we turn to tech solutions? How can we support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over anon1138917760 they interpret and act on data?

### Focus on scalar indicators is driven by need to describe reality, not change it
#### Alberto Cottica

Alberto had been hoping that ehnography-at-scale via SSNA could integrate, if not replace, the indicator paradigm, but after trying to get people to assess their own willingness to pay for, say, avoiding the extinction of some type of frog in Madagascar, or lowering the PM10 content by 10%, he found convincing evidence that we could never trust our results

He refers to James Scott’s convincing argument for scalar indicators being propelled by the modernist ideology that underpin the coalescing of modern states. This works for states but not so much for people. Modern states have created a demand for scalar indicators, but this has more to do with their thirst for administrative order than with a drive to understand what is really going on.

*Ethnography Team: Reflection on a Surveillance Pandemic* 

**Section 1. Setting up the event in future**
1. Identify a topic for the event based upon the ethnographic analysis done so far. Ask: what topics are the community most interested in? Which would be most useful/generative to do a deep dive into? 
2. Have at least a month to plan the call, invite a diverse range of participants (including the most active community members on platform on this topic),  and put informed consent procedures in place. 
3. Use the SSNA/codes/ethnography to pull out questions to ask participants during the call. (Research team can be present and ask questions as well as moderators). 
4. Record the call and transcribe the recording.
5. Post the transcription and code the transcription. 
6. Generate an SSNA based upon it (we need to brainstorm ways to have the Social part of the SSNA visualised in this, but at worst it’s a visualisation of the main themes of the conversation. At best, we separate each contribution into a different comment to see what concepts most frequently co-occur together).  

**Section 2: Ethical consent funnel and procedures**

Create an information sheet to put on the event page that is very easy to locate and is in clear, human language. This should also be present before the Zoom link is reachable/above the Zoom link. This needs to be done at least a week before the event, but preferably as soon as possible. This information sheet needs to contain at a minimum the following:

1. Description of Research Project (what the data will be used for).
2. Description of Event - duration, type of event, what they can expect to encounter.
3. That the event is being recorded.
4. How the event data will be made public, processed, and stored, and for anon1138917760 long (include the possibility that the call will be transcribed and posted).
5. That they have the right and ability to withdraw at any point (up until the publication of final research results, give date).
6. Who they can contact if they want any of their contributions removed/want to withdraw.
7. Potential risks and benefits of participation (in this section, we must list that we cannot guarantee them anonymity or data privacy, in part because we are using an insecure video client)
8. What body is overseeing the research: if ERC/H2020, for example, then mention that an ethics committee with ethics advisors is overseeing the project, and give their contact information. 
9. That they also agree to abide by these rules in terms of data protection and circulation -- they are not permitted to make information public beyond what the research project allows in point 4. 

Get participants to digitally sign an informed consent form with the above information at some point before they enter the call. 
* My thoughts on best practice for this: create an online consent form through something like Qualtrics or Google Forms (not sure about the security of the latter, would have to look into it-- or generate own internal form if we use the ER platform to video call). When the user submits the form, they are given the link to the video call and can enter. That way you know no one in the call has not gone through the consent funnel. 
* Example of an info sheet/consent form currently being used: https://www.smarten.org.uk/covid-19-study.html
* Noemi’s “Meeting Registration” page would indeed work, but only if the I’m not a robot box was changed to a “I consent” box. 
* At the beginning of the call, remind people that the call is being recorded and of the information on the information sheet (particularly on their ability to withdraw/opt-out).  
* Inform all participants when the data is posted on the platform. Underneath/on the same post as the recording, give contact information for who to contact if they want to change their consent status and reiterate that they can do so.
* Host the call on a secure platform so we can assure participants of a higher degree of data privacy/lower risk of data breach. 

We also need to be clear about what the participants are allowed to use the data for. It was clear that there were a few journalists on the call looking for a scoop/for information to publish. We need to be clear that part of the agreement is that you as a participant can’t go off and write using any kind of identifiable data. 

**Section 3: Content and demographics:** 

A. Content is shaped by WHO is participating: notes on participant demographics and its implications for content

1. Networks and recruiting participants:
The virtual meeting consisted of 36 participants including experts within the legal, medical and public health, digital tech, privacy and human rights, public policy and media communities. Participants in the call were invited through existing social and professional networks, i.e. were largely existing contacts of the Edgeryders team, primarily Alberto (friends-of-friends approach). Thus, many were based in Italy, some in the UK, Sweden, Belgium and France. Expanding and diversifying our recruitment for future events will allow us to hear from a broader range of experts, researchers and practitioners. We should brainstorm ways to do this effectively, perhaps with @anon3529867364 and @anon2674660368 (and others experienced in outreach and engagement). 

2. Encouraging Participation:
That being said, a full demographic overview is limited by the small number of introductions given by the participants. We should think of ways to give speakers the opportunity to introduce themselves (if they would like to/are able to) – in a manner that is comfortable to them. The chat was one useful way of doing this, but it’s not clear that chat introductions lead to more engagement between people of similar interests, since they came quickly and densely at the beginning. 

In virtual events lately, @anon942358443 has been doing a virtual version of the 15 minutes for coffee built in to schedules before conferences formally commence. One way of getting people more comfortable and chatting might be to schedule 15 minutes before the call as a “coffee and chat” period, a soft entry. This happened point to a certain extent, and could be further encouraged by making it an actual thing on the schedule. 

This kind of space for introductions (or thinking of other ways to do intros) may also encourage participants to become acquainted with one another before the discussion begins, and might foster more interaction across a larger number of participants during the call. Of the 36 participants, we find a small handful of experts on call participating more than once/speaking more than once. The conversation was largely driven by 4-5 main voices + mediated by community managers. 

The same goes for the conversation in the thread following Alberto’s report on the meeting. How do we maximize participation and encourage participants in calls to engage on the platform after the call? Also a topic we can brainstorm together. 

3. Making Discussions more Representative:
The following report is based on the exchange between a small number of speakers (in the discussion and chat), and though there are some salient themes, this may not be representative of the concerns/ideas of the broader community.

To that end, the participants (or at least those who were the most active) represented ca 3-4 European countries (incl. the UK). How do we include a broader range of people in these discussions? In terms of empirical examples, we mainly focussed our discussion on the UK and Italy, two of the hardest-hit countries currently affected by the virus. We need to bring in cases from countries with different experiences/ cases where it's ‘going well’: e.g. Germany, Finland, the Czech Republic etc.

This could be helped in our next call by pulling out questions we want to ask beforehand based on the ethnography done so far. We can set an agenda for the kinds of questions we want to ask -- pushing people beyond a few geographical cases, for example. This will also help moderation questions be more directed. 

**Salient Themes and Finding Common Ground**

As Alberto reported, core themes included the following (below). We focus here on themes which involved the most dynamic participant interaction (speakers referenced each other, voiced agreement/disagreement, mentioned repeatedly/stressed, asked directed questions to each other):
 
1. Immunity certificates/passports are ineffective and risky, particularly as we do not know anon1138917760 immunity works in the context of this novel coronavirus.   
2. Contact tracing via Apps and other technologies represent a trade-off approach in which civil liberties may be sacrificed in the interest of fighting the virus. The risks here are three-fold: 
i. Data and privacy: we don’t have a clear privacy-friendly solution for the development of these technologies; it is also unclear where the data will be sourced from and anon1138917760 this will be regulated. 
ii. Unequal distribution of risk:  there may be a disproportionate targeting of vulnerable communities,
iii. Absence of the counterfactual: these apps may be a way of letting governments lift lockdowns (presumably over economic concerns), anon1138917760ever, the effectiveness of allowing ‘normal life’ to resume is – as yet – untested: we are developing strategies without counterfactual knowledge to work with
 
Underlying these concerns is the question of necessity: why are these kinds of decisions being made? Why is there a push to develop track and trace technologies, especially if we lack evidence to support their effectiveness? 
 
Participants conclude that no, contact tracing is not the answer to fighting the  pandemic currently , but that they may allow us to prepare for the next pandemic or future waves of the current one.
 
 
3. Coordination and Cooperation across governments and communities is more pressing than developing new technologies. However, the fear expressed by participants is that the pandemic has offered governments a pass to rapidly develop and implement surveillance technologies under the guise of public security and virus containment. It is agreed that we need to maximize access to participation in these efforts (e.g. through slow media approach, collaborative and constructive journalism platforms, information sharing, collaborating with researchers and experts and contact-sharing, as well as crowdsourcing existing data, tapping into open data sources. In this sense, focus should be placed on improving existing infrastructures, cooperating across governments and harnessing the potential of local communities.  
 
 
**Meta Themes:**
 
* **Feasibility** (in terms of resources, time management, coordination, monitoring): Do we have the capacity to process new evidence, the capacity to react quickly and to use the resources and legal systems available to develop policy?
* Ensuring **Security** (on multiple levels): anon1138917760 do we avoid data being misused? How do we strike a balance between ensuring data privacy, anonymity and data security with containing the spread of the virus in a way that does not force a trade-off? How do we protect vulnerable communities? How does the rush to develop new technologies put medical professionals, their patients and communities at large at risk? 
* **Transparency**: Decisions we make about anon1138917760 to combat this pandemic need to be justifiable and their effectiveness and necessity need to be clearly definable. 
* **Access**: to information/reporting
* **Uncertainty**: the absence of counterfactual examples/data makes it easy to speculate, but also makes any decisions we make riskier. 
* **Temporality**: Discussions in the call highlight an apparent clash of temporalities: what needs to be done in the HERE AND NOW to contain the spread of the virus? VS.. What can we do to (a) prevent future pandemics and (b) be better prepared for them? These two aspects need to be untangled as they are currently being conflated. Furthermore, anon1138917760 and what can we learn from past pandemics, and what can this tell us about anon1138917760 we ought to approach the current as well as future pandemics?


**Section 4: Moderation** 

We agree with Maria that we needed more moderators, at least one for voice and one for chat. We’ve provided some suggestions above in terms of question preparation. Main summary here: ask directed questions when needed, but don’t be afraid to let silence take over for 5 seconds. One of the things we are taught in ethnographic interviewing is that silence feels way longer to interviewers than interviewees. It allows people to collect their thoughts and think more deeply about the topic at hand. Changing the topic too quickly and artificially can lead you away from those deeper and connected insights. Make sure any directed questions build upon the topic currently being discussed. 

We’ll have to brainstorm a way to link up chat questions to voice questions so as not to move too abruptly. We can also discuss the possibility of letting the chat unfold as it unfolds, naturally, as people may be more comfortable talking in chat form than speaking. As a result, be really careful with the direct callouts to individuals -- it puts people who might not want to talk on the spot. Perhaps it would be best to only ask chat questions aloud if they are direct questions on the topic that is being discussed in voice -- clarification questions, follow-up questions, etc. One of the great benefits of digital calls is that those who would not be comfortable speaking up in an in-person event might feel comfortable sharing their views textually -- we have to be sure to leave room for this. In the same vein, ‘lurking’ isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It may lead to people posting on-platform later, if we create the right channels. 

Moderation preparation: 
1. The host(s) develop a set of questions to ask based on the ethnographic data analysis outlined in section 1.1 and solicits input into those questions from the edgeryder team as well as on platform. 
2. In the call, these questions provide a guideline for the conversation but need not strictly be adhered to if the conversation veers from the topics identified (the whole point of this exercise to make room for unexpected insights to surface).
3. Consider moderation best-practices and netiquette, and communicate these to participants beforehand. See for instance this recent ACM resource.
4. Establish moderation netiquette with participants:
5. Mute when you are not speaking.
6. State your name often, especially when the call is without video.
7. Do not interrupt.
8. Have a good system in place for queuing questions or comments (via chat or by “raise hand-function depending on the software).
9. Repeat research purpose of the call often.
10. Mention and enforce the Code of Conduct.

Moderation execution: 
* Most calls will need at least two moderators, one leading the VOIP conversation and one monitoring the chat. 
* The chat moderator is responsible for documentation and information, i.e. asking people to mute, repeat their names (preferably by private DM), ensuring questions in the chat are relayed and capturing the chat after the call finishes.
* Both moderators are responsible for dynamically keeping the conversation going, this means coaxing the conversation forward and allowing for silence when needed. Key here is ensuring the speakers have the space to speak and build on each other. 
* Moderation follow-up:
* Send short “satisfaction” survey including questions like:
* Did this conversation meet your expectations: Y/N + elaborate
* Did you think the discussion was relevant to your life/work: Y/N + elaborate
* Were there topics that were not discussed that you had expected to hear about
* Follow conversation on the post about the event"

I agree with that notion for interviews, that problem is that a call with many participants is also to a degree a presentation or performance and the silence sounds long for those listening. So we need to balance that carefully."

We accidentally discovered another feature of the emergent SenseStack: if we do the call on now.edgeryders.eu, people access through their Edgeryders account. Then, it becomes easy to put through the consent funnel *only* the people who have not yet posted on the platform, and who have therefore not been through the funnel yet. Those who have posted before can simply be taken to the call's room. Elegant! This is evolving more and more into a @anon280016435 

But of course then we would need a recording function to work in now. 

Other advantage: in data protection and data safety terms, the audio file would now live on our server, stewarded in the same conditions as the database of the main Discourse platform.

### could use c.t. and s.t.

These abbreviations are found at universities after times:

* 10:00 s.t. means that the event will begin at exactly 10:00.
* 10:00 c.t. means that the event will begin 15 minutes later, that is, at 10:15.

**s.t.**  - Latin “sine tempore” = “without time”

**c.t.**  - Latin “cum tempore” = “with time”
This is also referred to as the “Akademisches Viertel” (academic quarter-hour)."

Of the 36 participants, we find a small handful of experts on call participating more than once/speaking more than once. The conversation was largely driven by 4-5 main voices + mediated by community managers.

The same goes for the conversation in the thread following Alberto’s report on the meeting. How do we maximize participation and encourage participants in calls to engage on the platform after the call?
[/quote]

There's only so much you can do in 2 hrs in a virtual room with many people who don't know each other. Have you considered a series of calls- 2-3? If you limit the participation per call to 12 people or so, you can have more calls with more in depth treatment of the topic. 
Also, can't you do more focused one-on-one interviews after the calls, with selected participants?

[/quote]

If you think of online events as community events in general at Edgeryders, that means they would need similar amounts of preparations, what we call sustained engagement. We know with @anon2674660368 that a full engagement campaign takes months. 
Examples of sustained conversations across different events:
1) OpenCare workshops - each had a dedicated team with targeted engagement in a 2-3 months runup. 
2) The Reef-series of 3 workshops allowed for people to register over 2 months for basically what was one single topic.
3) Coping with loss of work online series - now low key and has very anon2726675500 outreach done atm and still, the in-between online conversations can help fill in dots with socialization and followup to each call. Imagine what could happen with more communication support, more curation etc.

Otherwise, girls: thanks for a very high quality reflection <3 @anon"

But at the same time, we of course understand the need/see the value in being able to do more of these events with less lead time. So we can work together to find what’s optimal/makes sense.

We can also discuss the possibility of letting the chat unfold as it unfolds, naturally, as people may be more comfortable talking in chat form than speaking. As a result, be really careful with the direct callouts to individuals – it puts people who might not want to talk on the spot. Perhaps it would be best to only ask chat questions aloud if they are direct questions on the topic that is being discussed in voice – clarification questions, follow-up questions, etc. One of the great benefits of digital calls is that those who would not be comfortable speaking up in an in-person event might feel comfortable sharing their views textually – we have to be sure to leave room for this.

I would try to keep the voice conversation as one-pointed and moving naturally from topic to topic as I could while letting the chat be more free form. Chats always take on a life of their own anyway, and each person views it sort of differently.  For some it is a way of saying something they regard as a more minor point. For others the way to introduce a link. For others a way to bring tangents into the picture without derailing the vocal conversation.  And for still others a way to comment on anon1138917760 the voice action is going or to point out info about muting and audio quality.  So I would accept that it's going to be more diffuse.

Some will talk and some will only use the chat. I didn't talk voice in the conversation because I thought it more important to hear the others.  But I did make a couple of small points in the chat.

I think it is advisable to remind people to look at the chat even if they are otherwise 90% focused on the talk, because the moderator can send a private message without interrupting.  But otherwise, the chat is optional - not the main event."

Recent events (including the great [Surveillance Pandemic discussion](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-surveillance-pandemic-results-of-the-community-listening-post-on-risks-for-freedom-in-the-wake-of-covid-19/13183) we had recently) and reflections from @anon2674660368 and @anon2205132963 have made me give some thought to what our role is in enabling our community members to get through COVID-19 in the context of our NGI work. 

I have been turning over the concept of contact tracing, which the EC seems so keen on (and the efficacy of which our expert interlocutors questioned deeply). I think that 'contact tracing', removed from its other context, actually describes our SSNA work very well. A better kind of contact tracing -- where we trace anon1138917760 community members are helping each other already, and what they need to do that; and a tracing that enables more contact, not less, as we connect people together who we see are working on the same or compatible issues. 

The platform is already so much more alive with meaningful stories of these kinds of contact. 

The ethnography team is creating a new ""COVID Codebook"" and think we should create an SSNA mapping these ""COVID codes"" to sanon1138917760 anon1138917760 people are innovating and dealing with the crisis. In a way, this could pave the way for SSNA as a crisis management tool --- like in Open Care, mapping what communities are already doing and where they need help and support most. 

This builds on the Open Care finding, especially relevant given what is going on with the EC's divesting of funds to an app, that NGOs and governments are constantly putting money and resources in the wrong place. We already have concrete evidence of that from the surveillance pandemic and we have only just started this phase of community listening in the time of COVID. I am sure that @anon1075425386, @anon3529867364, and @anon2516847305 remember these lessons well from Open Care.    

I want to share some stories from Open Care to sanon1138917760 what I mean -- anon1138917760 community members are already expressing what they need in times of crisis; anon1138917760 those needs aren't being served by the big organisations that are trying to help them, because those organisations don't have the infrastructure in place to listen to what they need; and anon1138917760 community members use technology in creative ways that bring people together, when that technology is tailored to their needs and not designed elsewhere and handed to them as a pre-packaged solution that doesn't take into account their context. 


@anon

[quote=""anon
Mental health for the volunteers is a concern. Everyone lives on a knife-edge. Most volunteers self-finance their time working in Calais. They live frugally, stretching their money out. This means they end up living on top of each other. The warehouse team has a caravan park attached to the building. Volunteers with no money can stay there. Living up to 6 people in a caravan, with limited access to hot water and personal space. Volunteers who live in this enclave have a different experience to those who stay in private accommodation or hostels.
[/quote]

He stresses the need for mental health resources, but sanon1138917760s us that resources often don't get where they need to go: 

[quote=""anon
Everyone experiences some form of trauma. Most experience exhaustion. Often trauma comes from being in scary situations that you aren’t trained to deal with. Occasionally volunteer social workers, therapists and psychologists stop by the volunteer camps. They offer their services for free. As always, the people who need it the most are most likely to not take advantage of these services.
[/quote]

We learned this fact from @anon

[quote=""anon
Local authorities and their services operated superficially while the government was obviously unprepared. On the other hand, citizens reacted vigorously and passionately despite the fact that they didn’t mobilize immediately.
[/quote]

Her expertise and  research lead her to come up with solutions that would actually meet people's needs on the ground: 
[quote=""anon
Due to my profession as a fashion designer and manufacturer, when I heard about all those calls for clothing needs I started wondering who will manage all these diverse supplies. When facing a disaster, food and medical aid are considered top priorities but it’s not widely known that wearing inappropriate clothing under extreme conditions can become life threatening.

It’s noteworthy that if we focus on specific issues we can come to interesting conclusions e.g. Public misinformation by “official” announcements that were based on internet searching or common knowledge about clothing. As a result, there was a shortage of A-shirts (tank tops) while, considered useless, thousands of used socks were gathered although it costs less to buy new ones. Also, acrylic socks were suggested as the most appropriate. But when there’s no luxury of changing them anytime, other materials are more suitable like; wool, bamboo, cotanon3386180186, tactel etc.

Obviously, a problem, arisen from common everyday items, is more complicated than initially thought and requires an expert’s opinion.

So, without surprise, no one reached out to experts from the clothing sector for professional advice and assistance. Moreover both government and UNHCR ignored any proposals or contact efforts.
[/quote]

Meanwhile, she notes, resources were going horribly to waste: 

[quote=""anon
The inadequate coordination among government authorities, NGOs, solidarity groups and other stakeholders in combination with the anxiety of refugees led to a disappointing result. Large amounts of food, clothing, medicines and a lot of useless things (that could be a separate funny story), were being carried around Greece like a giant pinball machine. Unnecessary shipments, aid wasted, corrupted by mold, insects or still remain in inappropriate warehouses. A serious waste of resources.
[/quote]

Several community members also lamented attempts to use technology as a cure-all for refugee problems. As Alex asks:

[quote=""anon
How do we stop building apps and start building communities?
[/quote]

Attempts to provide care that are not localised and do not consult people themselves, in short, do not serve peoples’ needs best. Tomma found this when observing anon1138917760 refugees are creatively using limited resources to transform their living spaces:

[quote=""anon
we were sanon1138917760n the anon2726675500 gimmicks to improve the bare rooms where they are living in at the moment: How they pulled out screws and nails from the walls to make clothing hooks; anon1138917760 you make a wall-mounted phone holder with just duct tape and a piece of wood; where to store the food; they sanon1138917760ed us anon1138917760 they hack the beds to create more privacy and anon1138917760 to shield the light falling onto the upper beds with merely pieces of wood and a blanket to a point where one could create an entire ceiling with just white cloth.

We learnt quickly that the ideas of anon1138917760 to use the space could never occur to someone who has never been in that exact position:

**It was evident that they know best about the needs and necessities in their very situation and environment.**

With the creative potential, the only problem lies in the lack of tools and materials.
[/quote]

These are just a few examples of many, from Open Care, that indicate that SSNA's value is in **enabling contact through contact tracing**  -- seeing what community members are already doing to help each other, what resources they are articulating that they need, and connecting people together who are doing similar or compatible kinds of work."

To coordinate efforts and find potential connection points as well as to organise interesting and meaningful webinars for the community the edgeryders team is checking in with many old and new community members bringing their projects, initiatives or problems to be solved. 

Today I had a great call with @anon1785662177 .

His previous project:
https://edgeryders.eu/t/puntozero-weblab-about-innovation-and-healthcare-professions/653
seemed very interesting and relevant now. Since he could not make it to the COVID response call this Monday, so we met up in a direct call to start some ideas.

## @anon1785662177 is currently working on 3 things:

1. Working with his district to develop some collective intelligence approaches for crisis management and citizen engagement. The district becomes a problem solver. Like with the fab lab Barcelona. They used open tech to make citizens aware of their abilities to improve the district. 
See the example here: https://pablocommons.github.io/pablocommons.github.io/english
You click on certain corners on the map and you get the information provided by citizens.
Are there other entities like that like the district that would be open to work like that. We are working a lot with immigrants.

### NEED: 
* He looks for other districts in Europe that would like to construct a collective intelligence project.
* He looks for developers who could join the further development of the city map project. (ping @anon
* Problem: can currently not continue to map the city using 360-degree image in tech due to curfew
* Look for potential connections with Plato (ping @anon280016435). (https://pablocommons.github.io/pablocommons.github.io/english


2. Working for education. The schools are not used to learning or teaching via distance. We are trying to provide help with homework and events for families. He has done a project with Virtual Reality mapping of schools as well as teaching children between 5 and 10 to use VR for fun and to communicate ideas.

### OFFER:
* Webinar on virtual classrooms: https://scuolavirtuale.github.io/
Could do  webinar/1week course for parents, children (5-10) and educators to learn anon1138917760 to use VR and to make digital teaching more engaging. (more below)

3. Working with the hospital: He has been trying to connect to doctors and nurses or even students are willing to collaborate with us to provide the best information and provide prevention. 
Helping them to develop more effective communication strategies for children
Helping them engage communities
### NEED: 
* More help to connect and find willing healthcare professionals as collaborators.

# OFFERS:
Would do/share into a webinar/ 1 week course to use VR and online teaching as creative space. (Using the Edgeryders platform as a forum for the course)
Everything that is related to helping with the crisis.


### Notes on first ideas for Social Virtual reality Painting Course:

(See reference project on virtual classrooms: https://scuolavirtuale.github.io/
**Interesting point:** *Let’s think about virtual classrooms in general!* )

## The goal of the course is:
* To make virtual reality accessible to children, 
* To give children a creative outlet in times of quarantine and curfew 
* To use technology to empower creativity to give them means to articulates their wishes for development to test 
* To conduct online teaching in a more holistic way combining digital, analogue, asynchronous and synchronous work

### The first draft outline:
Workshop for children to learn anon1138917760 to draw environments for VR by hand:

* 1-week course for 4-5 families:
* Start first day with pre-recorded introduction video 
* Provide link to resources
* Provide MOOC/Manual on Edgeryders (authored by @anon
* Finish on last day with video call with slot for presentation for each child's project (preferably not on zoom)
* Encouraging families to upload and talk about children's drawing (no images of the children, just the drawings!) 
* Encouraging to make the room created connected to the topic of the quarantine. LIKE: “Draw you perfect room during this Quaratain time when you can not go out”
* Engage in discussion with families on anon1138917760 to use tech socially and creatively.

## First, run in the first week of May. if it works well we can reiterate + make resources available via the manual for teachers to do it with their students!

@anon1785662177  is currently working on a first draft proposal for this and will if possible join the Monday COVID response call next week."

According to the development and system, do you think is there a way to sanon1138917760 360 images on edgeryders.eu?"

It works with [kuula.co](https://kuula.co) 360° out of the box, using either their Embedly or HTML Embed sharing options. The HTML embed (iframe based) sharing option is preferable as it sanon1138917760s up larger.

If you want to use a different service for sharing 360° images, and similarly for any service for sharing virtual tours: it *should* work with Embedly / OneBox embed compatible links by just posting them on their own line here in a Discourse post. Again for the kuula.co example, you would write:

`https://kuula.co/post/7lMbd`

Again, results will be better when using iframe code snippets to do the embedding. To make that possible, tell me which service you want to use as I'll have to whitelist its domain in the admin settings first to make embedding possible."

Great! Thanks @anon2205132963 problem solved! We can use kuula only and leave whitelist as it is.

<iframe

Not too sure about the value for our purposes of coding these images, but it can be done:

Open Ethnographer contains a feature to code images by marking rectangular sections and adding an annotation to them. But the above 360° images are technically not images but JavaScript elements. You can anon1138917760ever create a panorama version of these, or in this case even better an ""unfolded cube"" version and code these. As this plain version is not relevant for normal users, I propose it would be added by moderator users into `[details=""Summary""] … [/details]` tags, to be hidden for normal users (except when they really want to see this)."

i'm figuring out the workflow as well, as it is something completely new and challenging.
Here are some answers to your questions..
 
    *How can we best support you?*
i think you are already doing it; edgeryders platform is the perfect place for this. As primer for both i would say to make it as simple as possible. Is a thread the best place, or a wiki? We must consider perhaps people already confident and familiar with edgeryders platform, otherwise they should be trained about edgeryders as well; i hope people from the community with children is going to be inspired by such proposal.

    *Can you post a link for a programme to use to do some experiments? Or could people post pictures in this thread to have them converted at some point?*
According to @anon2205132963 suggestions we proceed by uploading 2:1 images of drawings on [https://kuula.co/](https://kuula.co/) and then sharing those on edgeryders. 

    *would you maybe also be up to do a short introduction for “grown-up” artists (not much prep needed)*
of course

    *would you potentially be interested in collaboration with one or multiple creative education experts in developing the course?*
sure! :fist_right:

    *I gathered that you do not like to use Zoom, is it a prerequisite for the webinar that we find a different platform? @anon2104307281, do you think edgeryders.now could handle it? Probably 5 to 10 call members in early May.*
I can use Zoom, no problem. Anything goes.

About a possible virtual ethnography of virtual reality sounds great, as far as we understand anon1138917760 to deal with coding about no textual representations (@anon2205132963 thanks again! the idea of selecting rectangula sections) and thick description of imaginaries by children. Maybe we could ask other children to comment images and  be reflective on such experience. @anon942358443 any suggestions? (Hi there!). In the future, it would be also interesting to get a VR image of the social network about VR images... going fractal..sorry.

As soon as possible I'll provide a visual workflow and we can decide on a date for the event."

Not sure where to put this, but I received an email via the social network analyst listserver about the Social Connectedness Index (produced by Facebook). Facebook is sharing the data with non-profits and researchers (""This tool is only available to nonprofits and researchers. Interested researchers are invited to email sci_data@anon

""The dataset is called the ""Social Connectedness Index"", and measures the intensity of social links between geographies as represented through Facebook friends. It corresponds to the (relative) probability that two arbitrary Facebook users across two geographies are friends with each other. The data is available at various levels of geographic aggregation, such as U.S. zip codes. It also exists for regions around the world (e.g., NUTS2 and NUTS3 regions in Europe, GADM1 regions in most countries).""

https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid19/#social-connectedness-index

The data has been used to explore contagion patterns of covid19 in the US. I'm wondering if something else can be done with the data. For example, discover regions that are forgotten/ left behind because they are not connected, look at patterns between social connectedness and community responses.

What are your thoughts?

*This topic is now closed. Find the writeup and subsequent discussion [here](/t/13183).*

Several of the smartest people we know in the Net activism space are worried. SARS-CoV-2 will be defeated, at some point; but it might leave behind new limitations to civil liberties and privacy. We have had two decades of [consumer surveillance](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html); and at least one decade of the inter-governmental panopticon we learned about through [Edward Snowden's revelations](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/759833071/in-permanent-record-edward-snowden-makes-his-case-against-mass-surveillance). The right to privacy online has been tenuous at best for anon2298377336 a while, but that encroachment has not, so far, directly curtailed basic civil liberties. 

Until COVID-19 hit. Suddenly everyone is coding mobile apps to track who has been in touch with whom. There are reports of dodgy companies like Palantir and Clearview AI collaborating with major governments on digital tools to monitor and contain contagion. And, in the rush to beat the pandemic: a formidable social pressure is mounting to ""just do what we are told"". At the same time, many activists are trying to mount less invasive solutions; disposable identities that track one's health status during an outbreak and then are destroyed; or opt-in digital commons. 

Which freedoms are we really risking? What do we stand to gain in return? 

**We organize a community listening session on Thursday April 9th at 17.00 CEST**, in the context of [IOT Day](https://www.iotday.org/). 

### Format & practical information

* Full information sheet: **https://bit.ly/SurveillancePandemic**
* A Zoom meeting (ironic, I know – we are looking into alternatives, but we have no time to properly test before qe go live). **[Click here to join the meeting](https://zoom.us/j/566856233) starting 16.45 on Thursday April 9th.**
* **Not a panel, an open, moderated discussion**. A moderator will give the floor to people who want to contribute something. Some have already volunteered (see list below, updated continuously). If you want to share your point of view, use the call's chat to let us know, and the moderator will give you the floor. If you have a question to ask the speaker, ask it in the chat (better) or let us know you want to ask a question. Questions are taken before we move on to the next speaker.
* **We commit to doing a proper writeup of the result** (aka ""documentation, or it didn't happen""). Edgeryders also deploys its team of ethnographers for participant observation and note-taking. 

* **Everyone welcome**. Below there is a list of the people who have agreed to sanon1138917760 up. If you are coming too, we are happy to put you on it. If you prefer not to be on the list, that's OK too. 
* **Please note we aim to publish the content of the conversation as public knowledge, available to activists and scholars**. However, this will happen through writeups by people in Edgeryders. We will not record the call, and event the writeups will not mention any names.

### Confirmed at the time of writing – check back for updates

This is a list of people who confirmed their attendance, not a panel. The listening session is simply a moderated discussion. You do not need to be on the list to attend, just click on the link. Once in, if you have something to say, ask for the floor and a moderator will give it to you.

Thanks, recognition means a lot. As I said, we are anon2298377336 frustrated with anon1138917760 slowly it goes. I have been begging the EU to fund an open source Google Drive (at the time it was still called Google Docs) since 2008. And here we are now. :-( Hopefully we will pull through, together... and here we must acknowledge the great work of the Discourse people. We were always open source with our main platform, but it used to be a horribly clunky Drupal Commons affair with seven layers of duct tape keeping it together. Migration to modern, well designed FOSS was the best thing that ever happened to us!"

The Icelanding COVID-19 contact tracing app is not bad in this regard. [From their README](https://github.com/aranja/rakning-c19-app#rakning-c-19-app):

> With the user's consent the app keeps their location data. In case the contact tracing team of the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management needs to track someone's movements, they will be asked to upload their location data.

> This would allow for the tracing team to help retrace a user's movements for the last two weeks and increase the likelihood of identifying individuals you might have been in contact with.

Completely automated, continuous sharing of data might not have higher privacy implications when employing data obfuscation and cloaking mechanisms. But users can't understand these mechanisms properly, so they can't ""give freely"". Even I would prefer to give raw data on request than obfuscated data continuously.

It appears that the Icelanding system is about requesting the infected person for their location data of the last two weeks. That won't help to find all the contacts, as not all the places know their guests (public transport won't know, for example). What they could do is add a feature to this software that will broadcast a request like ""anyone who has been at [location] at [time], please step forward"". The app on the user's phone would do all the work of figuring out if the user has been there and then, and only if so, would notify the user, asking to confirm sharing this detail with the civil protection services. It's a distributed, privacy enabled database system because every user has full control over the location database on their own phone."

I very much agree. It's frustrating when there are so many great techniques for preserving privacy in location services that are cool pieces of cryptography...yet if we can't explain zero knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption methods, then we can't expect the public to trust them. Sad, but true. So these opt in approaches are the best (and if we're lucky, can spearhead more trust in those cryptographic methods).

*This is a picture from the Quarantine Jam that we organized two week ago in Trust in Play: this one was a playtest of a game where we were giving each other tasks, I asked everybody to sanon1138917760 me some skin.*

## “What are you doing in life?”

I'm a game designer and in this moment I'm teaching/ managing a Game Lab (http://gamelab.mica.edu/) for 75% of my time, and coordinating a branch of a project called Trust in Play (https://community.trustinplay.eu/) - the European School of Urban Game Design. On the side I have other design-based activity to keep me busy.

For the first part, we switched our activities online (this by the way is the first time in 10 years that I have a steady income so I fell really privileged). For Trust in Play I was coordinating the Nomadic branch, with Trainees all over the world, so we were already in a digital realm. 

## “What worries you the most about your situation now?”

I'm worried of a new reality in which physical human interaction will be discouraged.
I'm worried for my health (and my weight).
I'm worried for my relationship.

## “What makes you hopeful about the future?”

I hope that we find a vaccine soon.

## “If you are becoming more communal or not, are you going to do things differently? which ones?”

I don't know my neighbours, literally I don't know (and never cared) about who is living next door. I think this is something that I'm going to fix soon, but is only because of this extreme situation.

## A lesson that life is teaching you:

Don't over-design or fast-design. Brain power is limited and as humans we are not that good at predicting stuff."

I understand the deep fear that is almost metaphysical.. but anon1138917760 do you think this is going to affect your job? Are you hopeful about game versions that can and will be played online, and the opportunities for innovation in designing for a near future with less sociality as we know it?
This is such a creative field that it could open up endless possibilities..
But then, you are not a game designer only. You are an *urban* game designer.. so will you have to switch gears @anon2598219507 ?"

I'm not an optimist person, but I can't help but think: whatever you were doing or not doing before this crisis to diminish anxiety around certain things - now you can only do *more* of those, no? If you didn't have time to talk about problems, now you can do it. If you didn't go to therapy, now you can do it ( speaking from experience, even sessions on whatsapp can work if you need cbt or similar). If you didn't consider important life decisions, now you can carefully consider them - even addressing a problem is a bit of a relief and step forward. If you didn't have time to exercise, now you can do it. 

And something that we didn't have before lockdown and forced rest is this: a rested brain to help us diminish at least the stress of the daily life and work.. Can't be grateful enough for that. 
 
Two more notes:
- the above could stand provided that your basic needs for food, space, light etc are in check, if only to an extent. I mean, there could be a lot of shit happening for each of us, so yeah, it varies a lot..
- existential anxiety is probably harder to cope with these days, but that's anxiety for you.. and so other than therapy, new hobbies, meditation, like solid selfcare practices, I don't know anon1138917760 people deal with it."

""We use data to tell stories of business-related trends we focus on. We hope others take the ideas, build on them &amp; make them better.

At 3.8B, the number of Internet users comprises more than half the world’s population. When markets reach mainstream, new growth is harder to find as evinced by declining new smartphone shipments in 2018. While E-Commerce continues to gain share vs. physical retail, growth rates are slowing. While Internet advertising growth is solid &amp; innovation is healthy, there are areas where customer acquisition costs may be rising to unsustainable levels.

While Internet user growth is slowing, global innovation &amp; competition continue to drive product improvements, new types of usage &amp; monetization – especially in areas of digital video, voice, wearables, on-demand + local services &amp; traditionally underserved markets. Outside of USA, we focus on especially high growth &amp; innovation in data-driven / direct fulfillment &amp; financial services. We highlight massive global usage changes related to the evolution of images &amp; interactive gaming as communications tools &amp; the broad emergence of freemium businesses at scale.

The rapid rise of gathered / analyzed digital data is often core to the holistic success of the fastest growing &amp; most successful companies of our time around the world. Context-rich data can help businesses provide consumers with increasingly personalized products &amp; services that can often be obtained at lower prices &amp; delivered more efficiently. This, in turn, can drive higher customer satisfaction. Better data-driven tools can improve the ability for consumers to communicate directly &amp; indirectly with businesses &amp; regulators.

Core constituents (consumers / businesses / regulators) are increasingly drinking from a data firehose &amp; management challenges continue to rise for all parties. Broad awareness of challenges (&amp; related vigorous / heated debates) can be the first step in driving change.

Consumers are aware of concerns about Internet usage overload &amp; are taking steps to reduce usage – leading USA-based Internet platforms have rolled out tools to help monitor usage &amp; social media usage growth appears to be decelerating following a period of strong growth. Privacy &amp; problematic content concerns are also top-of-mind &amp; are following similar patterns.

Owing to social media amplification, reveals / actions / reactions about events can occur quickly – resulting in both good &amp; bad outcomes. In markets where online real-time rating systems exist, accountability can be improved vs. offline options as consumers &amp; businesses interact directly while regulators can also benefit.

Rapidly expanding connectivity has helped amplify voices of good &amp; bad actors. This has brought new focus to an age-old challenge for regulators around the world – finding the most effective ways to amplify good &amp; minimize bad, often resulting in different regional interpretations &amp; strategies.

As Internet systems become increasingly sophisticated, data-rich &amp; mission critical, so has the opportunity for cyber attacks. We are in a new era of cyber security where technology issues are increasingly intermixed with international diplomacy &amp; defense.

We focus on the impact of the Internet on work (via on-demand services &amp; remote options), education & healthcare – the materiality of current trends imply inflections are occurring. We update USA trending around government finances & the importance of immigration to the technology sector.

"" ...privacy [concerns] are a headwind for [Facebook] in 2019. It's one of the factors that's contributing to our expected deceleration of revenue growth throughout the year.  You've got regulatory – which was GDPR in 2018... the regulatory arc will be longer-term in playing out...Platforms like iOS are making bigger pushes in privacy &amp; that has the potential impact... then changes that we're making ourselves...we've elected to rollout GDPR-type controls globally...later this year, we'll be launching Clear History, which will also affect our ability to do third-party targeting.""

My most important identifier is Papa. Since BS and MS in Engineering at Stanford, I have had leadership roles in startups, nonprofits, and social enterprises in emergent fields. As a ""Shift Shaper,"" my work focuses on collective wisdom and altering systems of consciousness for positive impact. I worked on decentralization in early 2000s focusing on energy, food, and water and on building local economies. Now my focus is decentralizing knowledge & building collective intelligence with my startup Bridgit. 

We make the entire web into a collaborative research platform.

As a long-time Internet researcher, I have had no system for making sure the information I find online is readily available when I or someone else needs it. I've dreamed of a system that reveals previous research related to one's focus of attention. Imagine, down every rabbit hole, nuggets of insight and innovation.

[Bridgit](https://bridgit.io) is a crowd-mapped Google Earth for online information. Bridgit users build online knowledge maps of ideas & the relationships between them. Thus providing shared context for collaboration and communication without coordination.

Our mission is to connect all the information in the world into a universal knowledge map that can be accessed through the web or in the future through virtual experience, thus creating the possibility of ubiquitous context. We believe that if we want a democratic future, we must move towards an economy that is based on supporting rather than capturing attention. 

Our beachhead is emerging ideas. The problem is many groundbreaking ideas experience an uphill battle which delays their impact for years if not decades.  Our platform enables stakeholders to build knowledge maps & shared context for issues that matter; seeing ideas in context makes them more understandable and actionable. 

Bridgit enables insight, debate & discovery on every webpage by making the entire web into a collaborative research platform. Our browser overlay enables researchers to control, validate, organize & monetize their data. Advanced tagging enables the #OverWeb, a Trust Layer over the webpage. The #OverWeb is a Secure Social Ecosystem that generates valuable semantic, intent, & sentiment data. We use AI to assist in creating/validating content and neutralizing bad actors. 

Our platform supports a new category - Massive Online Research Collaborations - that enable researchers to build knowledge together without coordination as well as Bridgit Apps which enable organizations to expose their information and application functionality wherever relevant on the web.

We are starting a mapping project for COVID19. 

The COVID19 Mapping project aims to crowdmap the online information ecology for the COVID19 virus including second and third order effects of the virus. 

The project utilizes Bridgit ‘s mapping capability to catalyze a Massive Online Research Collaboration on COVID19. Massive Online Research Collaborations HELP researchers connect and interact with other researchers on any webpage WITHOUT any coordination EVEN IF they don't know each other or speak the same language WITH a self-generating interactive knowledge map. AI will monitor the knowledge map and send alerts about emerging threats, false news, and misinformation. 

Outcomes of the project include a first-generation interactive knowledge map, a shared context for collaboration and communication, a cohesive community, and faster better answers that accelerate insight, innovation, and learning.

We had the challenge of supplying readers with news from multiple sources (2 newspapers, the AP feed, a TV station, original content and a couple of other sources).  None of these orgs or feeds communicated with each other in any way, and the ""slugs"" or metadata, were always peculiar to their one source.  

]We wanted to present the news according to what it was about, not just where it cam from.  This was especially important with the limited screen real estate on a computer, plus Google had just started out and was nothing like the behemoth we have known for the past 20 yrs.

Our only meaningful option was machine learning.  What we did was create with the newspaper librarian a news category system and I hired her then on the side to tag a large number of current stories for a period of time so we could get a good sample.  

But for machine learning, that is not enough. One has to have a large amount of data to run it against in order, in this case, for the machine to decide what a news story was really about with any meaningful accuracy.  The bigger the sample, the more accurate the result.  But, since we were at a newspaper with electronic archives going back decades, we were able to accomplish it so that our system was highly accurate.  It was the first - and only - one of its kind.  Before Google News or the Apple News utility, we were supplying anyone interested with a lot of daily news that you could see either by source or subject.  This is a big reason why we ""punched above our weight"" in the news world.  Yes the New York Times within a few years had 4 times the traffic we did, but they spent 20 times the money to get there.

But it was only possible to get that accuracy by basing it on a huge - truly huge - amount of data.  Without that, you have to tag."

We're going for what consider is next stage of evolution of information ecology. The first stage was just pages connected by links. Then the Internet Platforms emerged and became hubs, and guided the commerical Internet into the Attention economy. As sites monetized their linking capability and content, they virtually stopped using external links. This reduced the connectedness of information on the internet. The impulse for web surfing is now satisfied by social media feeds. Rather than exploring, we are ""feeding"" on information that is being served by the machine learning algorithms of the Internet platform. 

IMO the next phase is collective knowledge maps that weave together the online information ecology with relationships. This will open up discovery orders of magnitude faster than search, context for any idea on the web, and support for knowing what to believe on the web."

### Interview: 
https://edgeryders.eu/t/podcast-zenna-interviews-pablo-velasco/11052 
### Transcript:
Zenna:  
Welcome to the third episode of the Edgeryders podcast. Today we're talking to Pablo Velasco.  He's an assistant professor at Aarhaus University. And you have a history, at least with your PhD, on researching blockchain? 

Pablo:
Yes. 

Zenna:
And currently, what's your focus? 

Pablo:
I still research blockchain to some degree because that's what I'm known for in the academic world. But I'm also interested in decentralized web in general, and automation processes in general.  Especially creative automation processes. 

Zenna:
Yeah. So we haven't had this conversation yet in private. I look forward to having that one too about the decentralized web. But to start off, I'm really curious about what journey brought you to wanting to study blockchain. How does it begin? And was there a societal perspective to this? 

Pablo:
Yes, that's my, my my approach always. Like, politics and social elements of technology, in this case blockchain. The first thing is that I started studying in my very early years, electrical engineering, because I really much it was very much into computers, technology and that kind of stuff. I was building my own computers. And I started that career. And then at some point, I started reading philosophy, I started reading Nietzsche, and I was still kind of young.

Zenna:
 Which one?

Pablo:
This was the  posthumous writings, so like a bunch of separate non order writings. And I got really engaged with that. So I left... 
Zenna:
What ideas got you engaged with that? 

Pablo:
I think it was more the type of questioning, because in electrical engineering, you will have very static ways to think about the world. Yeah, I was more pragmatic, more utilitarian. And these were questions about existence and why are we here? And what who questions are power, for example, right? So at some point that became more interesting for me to pursue to some degree. So I applied to a philosophy place in a modern University. And I got accepted. So I did, I made that jump. So technology always seemed like sub subterranean to some degree to my further background. Yeah. And then later, when I finish my master, I was still in philosophy, very metaphysics question actually. And I started using Linux, which I always I always have the tingle of it. It's been about 10 years now, since it started Linux and I was very driven by this idea kind of community enabled, instead of business capitalist kind of ideology behind it. So I was very much into it. So when I finish my master, I start looking for technology again, but always from this social perspective. So Linux was like that. The jumping port. Yeah. And then I have to select something to study there was kind of on that avenue. And I cared about Bitcoin at that moment. That was 2012-13. So it was already there, but still not on a mainstream level. And I thought, well, this is this was a great case study, right, because it's about decentralizing and making, building a system from a community. 

Zenna:
Okay, so you mentioned a word right there that I think is very interesting to also find out what it means to you. Because it's a word that is used a lot recently. But it has a lot of different meanings. So ""communities"" is one, I think most people have a similar sense of that one. But: decentralized. What does decentralized mean to you from a more society perspective, as you said, like technology is a anon2726675500 bit easier to discern what's decentralized, because the average take on what decentralized means, but societely, what does that mean for you? Is that a power question? Is that a community question? Is that a structural question? 

Pablo:
I think it's definitely a structural one in terms of hierarchy. Right. So political systems.  
Most historical political systems have have been based in strong hierarchies. So yeah, I think you have a decentralization leans towards something that is distributed in a different way. But it's still it's kind of blurry, because, yes, I think it's a word that is used too much.  Like a buzzword it has currency, but it's rarely defined, in part because it's difficult. Right. And I think it's very interesting that you mentioned not technology, but social because I think a lot of projects tend to mixed those two, and you kind of are confused which one they are talking about. Right. And it happened. I mean, my research was many bitcoins during my PhD. And there was a struggle for the centralization, but most of the time, it was meant socially, whatever that meant. But it was enacted technologically. So there was a like a gap, a gap. Yeah, like, almost, I'm missing the word, but a bit of psychotic difference in between those split. Yes. So what I will say is that you don't necessarily have to look on technological advancements to think about some sort of decentralized structures, right?
 
A lot of communities and working environments not a lot, a few, a few exist. They exist. And they don't necessarily need a technological medium to exist. Right. 

Zenna:
And you mentioned that to me like co ops. Yes. Or community run daycare. 

Pablo:
So yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think the co-op is the great example. Where systems of power are some degree decentralized. Right. In in more specific political examples, the Zapatistas in Mexico is not decentralized, per se, still like a representational system to some degree, but it makes a lot, it puts a lot of emphasis on having discussions from the grass roots and finding consensus from the grassroots before, instead of, someone deciding. 

Zenna:
it's where the masses of power are located in a society, yeah, yeah. community or in a some cases technology. Yes, yes. And that's a very interesting thing that you mentioned that, because I've felt that a lot myself actually where it's been a difficult path to maneuver between the decentralized webs and the blockchain cryptocurrency world, because they'll both use the same terminology of decentralization. I think I've seen recently that ""distributed systems"" is a term that's used often and like the decentralized distributed realms more maybe to differentiate from the only technological aspect that goes with the decentralized. I don't know, but it was a really interesting thought that I'd never put down so concretely before in my own head. Yeah. So thank you.

Pablo:  
If I could say a bit more about that. Another thing that I think we're putting in the table is that - and I carry these from a guy a researcher called David Colombia, Columbia a few years ago in a conference - is that there's like an assumption that decentralization is good and better and an improvement. And I believe most of the times it is, but he questioned that.  He was like, Yes, but why? Why are we assuming that that's that's an improvement? Right? So I don't have an answer for that actually. But I think it's important to ask not only anon1138917760 do we decentralize things, but also like, why are we Why should we decentralized certain things aren't and maybe not not everything right. 

Zenna:
And it's a highly politically subjective perspective probably too. I'd imagine that most people who also promote decentralization also promote the more liberal I guess it's called, of the political compass style. 

Pablo:
Yes, the more libertarian approach, they will say that, that will also be very much in favor of a kind of decentralization that is not the same as the co-op, right? Not exactly. And in in that sense. There are cool projects like the <UNKNOWN> and I researcher that gathers modern cooperative projects. And he calls like platform corporative activism. 

Zenna:
Cool. 

Pablo:
So it's like, but the emphasis on deck operatives and anon1138917760 technology helps them, but not the other way around. Right? Yeah. 

Zenna:
Cool. I'm going to ask you about that afterwards. So, I wanted to bring this back, though, because you mentioned that you found blockchain during 2012. And you started your PhD writing about it. And before we started this conversation, you gave me a tidbit, which was also the term ""utopia"", which you mention has been played a big role for you and your writings. Specifically, you mentioned the differences between utopias. Does this is also tie into decentralization?  Are they weaved together? 

Pablo:
I think they are, at least in their ambiguity. Yeah.  I mean, I haven't worked very publicly on the concept we talking about, but that was a narrative argument that was in my PhD dissertation for sure. Part of the narrative it was it was like, and it was applied to each of the different meanings of utopia, One is: Why does there no place in the says that a non physical place or non existing place, right, so a lot of that is about cyberspace, the, the inner we inherited from the 90s. And that kind of stayed still there. That cyberspace is in office. Yes, exactly. So yeah, and not even physical, but like a no-space. Let's call it like that. Yeah, there's that tanon2855557573 of utopia that comes from from from before.

There is also the the idea of a place that is to be achieved. So something that has to come to be yet. And that that's what I think decentralization is really tied to it because it's also like something will happen. And when it happens, things are gonna be different. And we cannot know and if it's utopia, it'll be different in a good way. Yes. There is also the utopia that is not meant to be reachable, right? There no place that the moment you reach it is no longer the no-place. Right? It's it becomes the place. I know. It's it's a bit cryptic, to some degree, but utopia is also something that it's always in the idea and remains in the idea. 

Zenna:
And I think it can't really exist in reality, because reality is never utopia. 

Pablo:
Yeah, yeah. And that's kind of the the use of of it. Not something like negative right is the use of it. 

Zenna:
And these three levels is something to aim for. 

Pablo:
Yes, exactly. Yeah. And I think there's three levels of different kinds of utopia. You see them in, in different ways in in, in decentralization-driven projects, right. That's the way I use it, at least in my in my work.

Zenna:
That ties very well into the narratives that are happening with the solar punk movement as well. 

Pablo:
Yeah. But I think it's important to separate which one is which, right, which one is it's it works as an ideology in a good sense. And which one is more elusive and more...

Zenna:
Beautifying. 

Pablo:
Beautifying? 

Zenna:
Yeah, like creating a utopia, image - a utopian image in the sense that in ""1984"" They used a Peace Institute instead of War. Yeah. It's like beautifying the world or utopia-fying. Yeah, that's fascinating. And then that also becomes a question of, is it subjective or not.

Pablo:
Oof! You ask me questions like that, and yes my background is philosophy...
but I will say that part part of the... subjective is maybe an important word here because it kind of separates..It is not individual. Like subjective is not necessarily individual, right, which is the kind of more Silicon Valley I will say,<UNKNOWN> oriented idea, individuals that are mediated by technology and that's a good thing in itself. And I think this, the other kind of more complex idea for a subject is a subject that is not an individual. It's a subject in a community, for example, that is made a subject because it's in a community and there's where you have the co-op more linked. 

So when you ask me if it's subjective, I immediately think of which kind of subject. 

Zenna:
Is it a community subject or is it an individual subject. While we were talking about communities and Silicon Valley, it brought me into something I'm just curious to ask you and see your take on because I've been pondering it in my own head and I have not come to a conclusion yet. The topic is DAOs: decentralized auanon3386180186omous organizations. And from my perspective, it's been curious because I've heard a lot of people mention DAOs that was of course, and, and tokenization of organizations in order for automating them, and with the subject in this case would be for the community or for the individual to speak. That's my own thought pattern around DAOs. Yes. Have you been thinking about DAOs? Is that like, as a part of your realm and studying blockchain? 

Pablo:
I mean, it is there of course because it's it's a topic that...It's around. I haven't written or thought specifically about that. But I think because in great part I related it with the DAO kind of attempt and failure from from a few years ago, right.

But I think tokenization it's a topic that is closer to where I have been thinking. And one of my issues actually, with about blockchain projects, is that they tokenize. I mean, a lot of the early blockchain designs, they were based on tokenization. Right on a production of units. That was similar to production of economic unit before it. So token: I think part of the the issue well, I don't know if it's an issue, but part of what I see as a problem is that tokens are related to economic units, like small units of value, that kind of organize the relationship. Right? And in that sense, it lands too close to the economical systems that we already have. Right. So for me, the idea of the token is very tied to pre existing economies that the quality is that getting rid of those economies right, going beyond those. On the other hand, it's not like I know exactly what will be a good replacement or attempt. 

Zenna:
Speaking of good replacement seminars, are there any projects that you've encountered on your journey that you've been like, wow, they're kind of on to something. You know what I mean? 

Pablo:
Yes, but I guess I have to say that not that many.

Zenna:  
Is it that you have high standards?  
maybe to broaden your radius?

Pablo:  
I think my problem was, I mean, it was very invested in the early years, like 2012 to 2016 or 17, and my main problem was that most of the projects will have a very, very verbose way of presenting the project and then they will be a replication of other systems, right. Like a lot of alternative currencies, which are not a trendy thing to say now, now you say decentralized apps, but but the way they work is not that different. So it's just like a new... 

Zenna:
t's a lot of tag words. cuz they use the technology. Yeah, blockchain technology. Yeah, this system is the same. 

Pablo:
Yeah, exactly. And most of them will phrase their projects in in radically different ways. And then you will see that the working it was exactly the same right as as other crypto. So I guess it's hard to we can be very blinded by the amount of projects, if you could see the list of decentralized apps are there. They're massive, right? But, but when you go beyond that and start to see like, well, what's a specific difference and of this one, you see that there, you can cluster them in relatively easy, you can also check, like which degree of development they had, most don't have that much development. So from the massive amount of projects that you can see, it's easy to decimate that number. And then... 

Zenna:
because of the similarities

Pablo:
I will say that it's less that the centralized projects but I have found interesting and more the, the loops that go back to the cooperative, and then the technology they use is like the secondary thing, right. And in that sense, I mean, the decent project was was an interesting one that eventually was kind of implemented to some degree, at least in Barcelona or some other communities, that it started like that, right, like, like, it was part of it was like a cryptocurrency at some point. And but it ended up being to some degree, successfully implemented for a different way to relate related to government. But then again, it was because I think tech was a bit secondary. And the main point was like, anon1138917760 do we reorganize this between people for people? Yeah. So and that kind of those kind of projects is the ones that you don't see that often. Many because it, there's, they're small, right? And they don't have like venture capital or big websites or anything like that. So that's why this idea of platform corporate activism listing is interesting because you see that it's, it may be a really small project in a small community, in Ireland, or in your country. And for me, that's the really interesting part. 

Zenna:
So when we go into the fact that there's a lot of smaller projects out there in the realms of more social action. Yeah. And then secondary technology. We have the case in a lot of the mainstream, more default internet, as we know it, that there's also a lot of misinformation going around. Do you think that there could be a point in also having these smaller initiatives of technology? 
Or do you see that there's a risk in the smaller initiatives existing and then not learning from each other because they're too small? Or in the in the space of worldwide webs? Yeah. to local smaller initiatives?
How do you fare?

Pablo:  
I think I'm more driven to local networks even if they are disconnected between each other in great part because there is different ways and things to solve in regions, right? So kind of having like a magical solution or technology solution or something our organization solution for a really broad spectrum of people. I think that's really complicated, probably destined to not work because of the differences in localism. Right and coming back to Zapatistas in Mexico. Part of their speech is that attempting to replicate them in other countries and other contexts is like, that's absurd, right? 

Zenna:
Correct me if I'm wrong, did they not train in the forest? And secret for like, 10 years or something? Yeah, it was like that. 

Pablo:Yeah, it was about 10. He was kind of small guerillas. I mean, it has a very interesting history. So they came out in 94. But since the 80s or so. But yeah, the it's a really long project, right? It's a very interesting project, but the it has 30-40 years in the working and, and it's local. I mean, it's it's about a certain region in certain communities in Mexico, and for that they made it work in a beautiful and very utopian way.

But then again, if you just take like that risk recipe, and try to apply it in, in Denmark or whichever region, it's, it's probably not gonna work, of course, because it's important to take care of the context. And that's why local communities and local networks even, cannot communicate between each other. For me that's kind of anon2298377336 relevant. 

Zenna:
Especially in today's globalized world. Yeah, getting resources from all over the planet and shipping it all over the planet. Yeah, that's something huge amounts of co2 all over the planet. It feels like also finding local solutions could be a good key. 

Yeah. So we're going to wrap this up on this lovely note of globalization and Zapatistas. Thank you for a wonderful conversation. Thank you. And yeah, any last notes you want to throw in there?

Pablo:  
No, I'm just glad that these kind of channels exist. And that we keep asking questions about these topics like not just answering right now just trying to offer solutions. 

Zenna:
There's also like, many questions to keep asking before coming with a concrete pre-packaged ""Buy Now 99%.""

Well, yes. So keep asking questions. And if you want to ask Pablo questions, cuz it will actually be available to answer questions on the Edgeryders platform. Yeah. That's it for us. Thank you so much. 

Pablo:
Thank you Zenna, a pleasure to be here."

Well met, then, Pablo. I am Alberto, one of the old timers here. And you are right there, neo-cooperativism is becoming a thing. I am originally from [Emilia-Romagna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia-Romagna), which has a *very* strong cooperative tradition. Too strong for me to be starry-eyed about it, because I saw them succeed and behave much like any large company, no worse but also no better: capture by senior management, greed, wrongdoings etc.

I'm not teaching this term, so I was not immediately affected by physical distancing. But most of the activities at the university are cancelled, so I'd say that productivity in general is lower. 

Some of my colleagues are using Blackboard and or Zoom for virtual classrooms, because it's part of the university resources. However, these are neither free nor open options. 

An excellent replacement for *virtual classrooms* is [Bigbluebutanon3386180186](https://bigbluebutanon3386180186.org/), which works really well, and **is open source**. As such, **you can install an instance in your own servers, or use the demo offered by the company** (I tried it with +40 people on a +6 hours conference without any issue). 

For *collaborative writing*, [etherpads](https://etherpad.org/) are a decent gdocs replacement. **Also open source, they can be installed on any server, or you can use a trusted service** (I recommend using [Riseup](https://pad.riseup.net/))

Like the ones above, [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) seems to be a replacement for OSS replacement for *videoconferencing* (it has a web service Jitsi Meet, but I haven't tried it).

Crisis times are a good opportunity to see what is needed and what is discardable (also in terms of software!).

**Much happened in the last week and everyone is dealing with the new situation as best they can. Here is a ""short"" summary of the current discussions ongoing:**

Measures of social distancing to hamper the spread of the Covid19 virus are taken by individuals, organisations and states. 

Edgeryders and the NGI community want to be an active part of helping us cope and learn from this new situation.

We all experience new perspectives on social and digital relationships as well as coping and engagement mechanisms. Many very interesting conversations are had all across different platforms and in homes all across the world. 

*However many platforms, such as for example Facebook will just forget most of these conversations and have even started to suppress some of them through their algorithms flagging them as spams. More details on this promise and anon1138917760 we are and will be using the Social Semantic Network analysis in this situation will follow soon. For now I just want to share this short quote @anon942358443 to summarise our goal and promise to you:*

> **Our goal is to get the EU to see and facilitate the Internet as an infrastructure to community resilience , not just paid content delivery. Share your stories, and we will aggregate them into a structured, human-readable output that informs the European Commission’s policies. We will also use the platform to connect with each other – to help facilitate all the kinds of community-based care we can imagine together.**

Below you can find an overview of some of the main ongoing conversations:

I think a good place to start is @anon280016435 ‘s personal yet very well researched and factual supported story about anon1138917760 he started to understand the severity of the current crisis.

https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-journey-to-understanding-covid-19/12816


Since then, we have started many conversations to create space to discuss different aspects of the situation.

**Let's start with positive news:**

Here we share positive insights the community members have during this changed situation which might have an impact down the line:

**Work has changed for many people and we are discussing that here:**

Teachers and students are among those especially challenged by this crisis and we want to discuss what are the problems and anon1138917760 we can help here:

https://edgeryders.eu/t/suddenly-teaching-and-learning-remotely-what-do-you-do/12844
Many people face a loss of work and income during this crisis. Here we discuss your stories regarding that:
https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-to-do-when-losing-work-during-covid19-community-calls-each-tuesday-noon/12886/

In the following thread we discuss anon1138917760 to get local foundations and NGO's online and help to do so:
https://edgeryders.eu/t/anon1138917760-can-community-foundations-and-local-ngos-maintain-their-programs-and-move-online/12899/

https://edgeryders.eu/t/is-corona-keeping-you-away-from-your-home-country-family-and-friends/12856/

We want to help everyone to have the best possible remote work experience. Therefore we are working on a MOOC as well as direct counselling for distributed work. The project is to be financed via crowdsourcing. Check out where we are now and find out anon1138917760 you can profit or contribute:

## About this Event

""Breakthroughs in our capacities to communicate and coordinate restructure society. Language birthed culture and hunter-gatherer tribes. Writing forged kingdoms and agriculture-age empires. Printing enabled nations and industrial-age economies. The Internet launched a new restructuring of society, but is constrained by computing tech designed for centralized control. Learning from nature's blueprints, Ceptr provides an evolvable, fully distributed framework for coordination and sense-making on all scales."" [Arthur Brock](http://ceptr.org/)

""If we are to preserve the democratic and creative promise of the Internet, we must continuously diagnose control points as they emerge and devise mechanisms of recreating diversity of constraint and degrees of freedom in the network to work around these forms of reconcentrated power."" [Yochai Benkler](http://benkler.org/Degrees_of_Freedom_Dimensions_of_Power_Final.pdf)

___________

Each of us wants to have control over anon1138917760 and with whom we interact. In order to evolve and thrive, our communities must support everyone's uniqueness. Yet today, our online relationships are dominated by centralized corporate web sites.

In this event, you will learn about some peer-to-peer projects based on blockchain and holochain technologies that enable a distributed web with user auanon3386180186omy built directly into its architecture and protocols. Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change anon1138917760 we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, these technolgies liberate our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.

Come and hear about Collaboration, Collective Intelligence and Next Generation Internet technologies that facilitate this to happen!

* Bring people together to hear anon1138917760 the Artificial Intelligence in the hands of the GAFA group has led us to the centralization of data and therefore centralization of power that is affecting our democracy at global scale.
* Create awareness of recent technological developments that have the potential to decentralize the internet, protect our privacy/data, create transparency and openness for inclusive collaboration at scale and therefore create a collaborative decision making system.
* Teach the basics of several open source technologies (Holochain, Democracy.Earth, E-Women) to the Open Source community in Brussels, and invite them, active them to shape these technologies for a better Europe.
* Discuss anon1138917760 Intellectual Property may need to change to enable a collaborative Internet to happen, and facilitate the creation of open knowledge (open source, white/green papers) with respect for the authors while enabling collaboration to scale.
* Facilitate networking between different actors for collaborative projects around raising technological and social opportunities.

Dear all,

Thanks for attending the event 'Cooperate at Scale' that took place last Sunday.  Thanks for your active participation, for your questions, your comments, the networking and talking that happened, and in general for your great contributions. Very grateful to have counted with you, on site, and online.

Even though there is room for improvement, I feel happy to have taken the step to organize this first event in a series of events, and I feel satisfied with the quality of the content shared and also with the 'quality' of the audience.  I feel honored to have attracted such a interesting people like you! Thanks!

To organize the next event even better, and in co-creation with you, I would like you to join the Edgeryders platform, the place where the conversations about the next events will happen. I will also share the presentations and video recording of the event on the platform.  Join it here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/cooperation-at-scale-next-generation-collective-intelligence-and-internet/11989

Please share your comments about the event, your learning. All comments are welcome, the critical ones too! :) Let's shape together the content of the coming events by answering some of the suggested questions, or by sharing freely what you feel of value.

- Tell us about yourself.  What are you working on, and why were you at the 'Cooperate at Scale' event?

- What have you learned at the event? Is there something new you heard? Something that you liked? disliked?

- What would you like to learn more in deep at a next event? 

- Do you know possible sponsors for future events? volunteers that may want to help us?

- Do you think that people may want to bring food to share for a next time? anon1896561845-to-peer talks and Potluck gathering?

 

Feel free to also invite other people to the platform, and forward this email, so we shape together the content of the future events.

Feel free to send me an email too! Looking forward to keeping in touch with you!

Warm regards,
Liliana."

I totally agree that technology has the potential to enable thousands of people to be together, collaborating, something that was impossible before.  This is why think the annotation layer is so important. The annotation layer enables us to connect and collaborate on any page. So people can meet where they are rather than having to go to a walled garden.

Marc Andreeseen - creator of the first Web browser Mosaic - says the Internet has a Big Missing Feature: Annotation. https://genius.com/Marc-andreessen-why-andreessen-horowitz-is-investing-in-rap-genius-annotated, The Webpage was always meant to be a Launchpad for Insight and Debate on it’s contents. Annotations were removed from the Mosaic browser in 1995 during the fight for survival with Microsoft Explorer for lack of storage - there was no Cloud! 

I am most intrigued by his closing statement in that article, ""I often wonder anon1138917760 the Internet would have turned out differently if users had been able to annotate everything – to add new layers of knowledge to all knowledge, on and on, ad infinitum."" 

Here is a slide presentation from a project that I like called Hypothesis (http://hypothes.is) about annotation: https://docsend.com/view/es4euyk

In the future, in what I call the the #OverWeb, today's web page is simply the contextual footprint for intertwingled worlds of information, interactions, and experiences emanating from content elements on the web page."

The COVID19 Mapping project aims to crowdmap the online information ecology for the COVID19 virus including second and third order effects of the virus. 

The project utilizes Bridgit ‘s mapping capability to catalyze a Massive Online Research Collaboration on COVID19. Massive Online Research Collaborations HELP researchers connect and interact with other researchers on any webpage WITHOUT any coordination EVEN IF they don't know each other or speak the same language WITH a self-generating interactive knowledge map.

_____________
## Owen Gaffney:
**Good news:**  The next decade will be fastest economic transition in history. The Momentum is there and humanity is good at rapid change when it has had a vision.

In china every week 5000 electric busses. Shenzen, in last 5 years has transitioned its' entire bussfleet to electic busses. Next, they will be replacing the cars. The driver is that people do not want to live in polluted cities. In Norway 20% of all cars purchased in 2019 were electric cars.

This coincides with an exponential growth in adoption of alternative energy sources: much higher than has been predicted by the International Energy Agency:

Third: British politics. Even in this midle of this storm in june this year british govt created legislation to mget to 0 emitions by 2050. Even though cannot agree to leave EU.

**Need to slow down**

Guy advising In shipping industry you can slow down carbon emissions by 20% if you slow down the speed by 12 Knots (check number). Example of chinese busses going faster, short sighted victory because china still largely running on carbon industry. You draw lithium from huge desert areas, impact of your lithium on the environment. With simple changes you can reduce carbon emissions.

Owen: on busses in chinaa - the transition from coal to renewables is happening much faster than you think - we can see that china is shifting its economy.

American guy : concerned citizen, find it very interesting anon1138917760 to create changes in the political systems.I come from texas where it is difficult to explain. How do we get this movement going? As an individual I feel lost to change the incentive from profit to wellness to everyone? Wes

Woman coming from oil and gas, decided to leave the industry but was asking what can you do? Ver hard to orient yourself, good lucky to run into the right person, a person who offered me a job in a company that was doing good things.
Investment into different kinds of people being different kinds of impacters?
--------
Fredrich does stuff with food: am part of NGO trying to make foodtech accessible - foodstack. A question: How many in here would like to get hands on involved in something that creates a possible impact? (everyone) Alot of people want to do something, but not sure what. Then we turn to institutions and other org that are used to doing things for us. But this doesnt work - we need to. Automated vertical farming - solution is not perfect but we are getting close. Mushroom production.

We have had transition from healthy to unhealthy diets, we know the transition can happen very quickly. ""Everyone wants to live healthier"".

Whynot provide better alternatives through tastes, flavour etc.

Investment in the school system, what is similar thinking arount climate transition. Nordic secret - folkhogskola, personal and skill dvelopment - being able to have softer landing/transition. So people can become part of this transition, find their place - skillwise, livelihoodwise but also identify and social surroundings -building networks that see, sustain and reinform norms, culture and behaviours needed to move . Personal incubation and acceleration for climate transition.

Key:
Feelings of sense of lack of control
Disinformation campaigns
- Firsty its about inequality: 
* in more equal societies consumption is tempered down * We have more trust, and better collective decision making
* What we see with populism and rise of nationalism sanon1138917760ws that rapid change is totally possible
* Seeing it in economics: market forces for sustainable solutions is there.

Questions: what is different this time with the movement? because market forces are with us? were they before for other changes?"

*Hello dear community,*

*2020 is upon us and we are restarting the biweekly Community call schedule. This year we would like to use that slot to feature topics, projects and community members.* 

@anon3272854026 has agreed to open the roaster with a webinar on Open Source Software.

# 1. Webinar ""Let's Open Up!"": 28th of January, (Tuesday 18:00 to 19:00 CET)

# 2. Webinar ""Knowing the Problem"": 11th of February, (Tuesday 18:00 to 19:00 CET)

# 3. Webinar ""Working together!"": 25th of February, (Tuesday 18:00 to 19:00 CET)

# 1. Let's Open Up!
Learn about anon1138917760 to use and support opensource!

One of the learning from @anon3272854026 's workshop on teaching teachers open source was that ""‘Not even software developers’ seems aware of the fundamentals of open source and the four freedoms. "".
After working with and researching Open Source Software for years, he wants to share his learnings and tips with us and work on figuring out anon1138917760 to further the FOSS environment.

For this session - the short agenda is as:

1. Welcome everyone and short introductions.
2. A presentation of the outcome from the “Teaching teachers open-source workshop”.
3. Plan next IRL meeting (topic, venue, event marketing).

Everyone welcome to participate that wants to help build an edgeryders community on open source.

![outcome_opensource|690x455](upload://j6lYBDUKV29LwOj1arHkbjsx6e2.png)

# 2. Webinar ""Knowing the Problem"":
The first Meeting offered a very interesting discussion with some great FOSS activists with firm tech backgrounds. During the last week, @anon2960261037 and @anon1862495902 have explored the situation of It and opensource education in their regions (see posts below). DIscussing those findings and the connected questions such as **""Do they (the ""end users"" (Teachers, students, etc. ) know there is a problem?""**
WE will try to invite some experts from the teaching background and discuss further the direction and form off an approach to further Opensource in teaching.
@anon2960261037, maybe you could also talk a bit about sustainability for Open source projects?  [anon1138917760 to make opensource projects sustainable](https://edgeryders.eu/t/economic-sustainability-for-open-source-projects/12082) @anon2960261037, would be great to have you there! 

# 3. Webinar ""Working together!""
In the third discussion, we want to sketch out a concrete plan for further collaboration via an intensive full-day workshop and whom to invite to that event. 
@anon3272854026, looking forward to see this project and your workshops grow! 

or the FOSS environment (@anon1862495902, what do you think would be a good topic?)

Thanks for the call.  I was reflecting a bit afterwards and I thinking of it at 50,000 feet while picking up a new leash for my dog. 

The background is I have been listening into a few of the OCI lab mena lectures, and chose to dig down into one of the books/models that they are using to aid the mena entrepreneurs.  @anon

When reading this book they describe defining a hypothesis then testing it out with your perspective clients.  The test is partially to answer these questions:
* The customer has a problem
* The customer understands he or she has a problem
* The customer is actively searching for a solution and has a timetable for finding it
* The problem is painful enough the customer has cobbled together an interim solution
* The customer has committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to solve the problem

And the book continues to describe the {End Users, Influencers, Recommenders, Economic Buyers, Decision Makers, Saboteurs}; all of which would exist in either at a national or kommune scale within the education system in Sweden.

While business related, the anecdote on “Customer Validation” is anon2298377336 telling, since some of the solutions may fit this model.
> “You need to pick up the phone and call the top five accounts on your sales pipeline. Ask them this: If you give them your product today for free, are they prepared to install and use it across their department and company? If the answer is no, you have absolutely no customers on your forecast who will be prepared to buy from you in the next six months.”

This I don't know, and could be more rhetorical in nature, is there “pain” being felt from current solutions? This might be more of an open question we could explore."
9,69541,2020-01-28T21:22:23.205Z,12409,0,12,11,1,0,0,22.4,69539,anon2516847305,anon2960261037,"Erik will hopefully reply, but I got the impression that the pain is something insidious that comes from early conditioning to using a few set products from the biggest companies, some of which give their stuff free if you take ads along with it.  There are video services in the USA for schools that has this same business model. One is https://www.schooltube.com/
They seem harmless enough. But the orientation is definitely towards being an enduser and not part of those who create, except inside those products.

When we were on our phone call I had the thought that there are forces trying to move the Net closer to being more like the auto industry. And in some ways it is already there.  But as long as there is open source, it doesn't have to be like that and can still be an amazing creative medium for seemingly anything you want to do.

But I also think that civics and social responsibility are topics schools try to teach - anon1138917760 to be good citizens.  In this day and age, that cannot be divorced or separated from information technology and its mass use.  So, in addition to learning anon1138917760 to be creative by trying or studying open source, it has a civics lesson and philosophy built right into its core.

I think Erik used the term ""war.""  I agree.

Do any of you remember the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project that Nicholas Negroponte and others set up 10-15 years ago?  That was an open source laptop that could even be powered up with a hand crank.  It was designed to be as disruptive as it was useful.  The Director of the project was former Media Lab Director Walter Bender (Nadia and I know him pretty well - and he is still a friend.)

In 2007 or 8 I was in Cambridge on a job interview. I visited Walter in his OLPC office.  I knew the project was struggling but wasn't clear on why.  He told me that when they arranged with Ecuador and one neighboring country, maybe Peru, not sure, to bring a big number of those laptops to the kids in those countries Microsoft and Dell both went to the leadership of those countries and told them straight out that if they do not abandon the OLPC project completely, Microsoft and Dell (and who know what other companies, but those two for sure) told them that they would no longer support the government offices that rely on Office and Dell computers.  I'm sure you can guess what happened next - OLPC was denied 100% by those countries.  The chilling effect was pervasive and was a big part of killing the project.

Those guys do not screw around.  To me this is yet one more reason why open source needs to grow, not shrink.  I think also that anyone who opposes smart city stuff with a viable alternative or reason not to do it will encounter similar opposition."

Did not sound too bad (they want to play a lot with https://scratch.mit.edu/ apparently, and relatively few product-based application teaching â la: ""This is anon1138917760 Adobe Photoshop looks like""). Also he said that the teachers really want to teach informatics but are rather scared. So they do offer workshops for teachers where the teachers learn anon1138917760 to implement the curriculum within their school and these workshops are very well visited apparently (overbooked).
The general situation is different though, because in that federal state it is not mandatory for the pupils to attend the informatics course (pupils have some choices what they want to pursue) and other details of the school system.
The time and setting did not allow for full-on discussion about open source, underlying values and all the sweet stuff we touched in our call, but interesting coincidence."

This is partially due to the fact that while I know the equivalent exists in Sweden, my swedish skills are pretty loose.  This was also to see if this problem has been solved elsewhere :wink: 

The takeaway from this quick check is there is most of the goals and outcomes are pretty much in the 3-r category; reading writing and arithmetic — with a foundational text overlying outcomes at https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/ed/pdf/K12/curric/TechnologyVocational/TechnologyEducation.pdf for the broader region.

A few items that are very interesting from this latter document:
* They have applied a competence model (see page 5.)
* No technology is proscribed, but the actions are (ibid.)
* Ethical dilemmas are highlighted. (ibid.)

The IT education curriculum also doesn't mention any vendor, but highlights to use appropriate tools such as python or R to meet learning objectives. https://www2.gnb.ca/content/dam/gnb/Departments/ed/pdf/K12/curric/TechnologyVocational/ComputerScience110.pdf

I'm not sure if this is helpful; and if I look at the model[†](https://edgeryders.eu/t/lets-open-up-an-open-source-webinar-community-call/12409/8?u=emile) above;  with the low awareness of open source solutions, does the “End User” know they have a problem?"

> *> Great Storm (Sabine). But not too much damage.*
> *> John:*
> *> Has read this morning: No rain in Feb in california! Quite Alarming. Going to edgeryders get together in Sicily. His mother is anon2298377336 ill at the moment and taking care of her is currently very demanding.*

> *> I am good. Still no snow so! :(. Engaged in some good discussions in developing NGI for incubator purposes and a pitch for a workshop series.*
```

**Notes:**

Maria posted invitations to the call in teacher facebook groups, but nobody reacted.

Ergo: we have to get in contact differently!

Erik emphasises the need and advantages of an direct intense in person workshop!

* Discussion on digital auanon3386180186omy - and actions

What do we need for a workshop?

We need to make two lists:

1. Topics
2. People to invite

Topic list:

Examples:

* Data sovereignty:
  * Digital Auanon3386180186omy.
  * How do you maintain the freedom of your own data
  * How do you keep your password save
* GDPR and what it means for teachers! (as a entry door into the topic)
  * How do you deal with other people's data?
* Subscriber to your life?...Ingrown subscriptions. Which programs do you learn to use?
  * Dependence on subscription software
  * A divided society - subscribers vs owners.
  * A divided society - consumers vs creators.
  * A divided society - “free and capable” vs “enslaved and incapable”
* Understanding the language of terms and conditions
* Do you own your money?

Felix story of speaking to an IT involved teacher:

Spontaneously met a headmaster of a small school in Germany.

That person was part of the team (12 persons) developing the IT curriculum for schools for that federal state (for age ~10-16 yrs). Before that he ran a company equipping schools with hard and software and providing workshops. (probably one week workshops on what to teach and anon1138917760 to teach in IT following that federal states informatics curriculum). (open source honey:). (you can apparently finance and engage with beekeeping for teachers currently, as that is a projects many schools or teachers would like to install))

The demand for such workshops is very high. More than are provided. The teachers feel that they can not provide the skills for good IT teaching, as there is always some pupils ahead of them.

What do you think about developing a paid workshop offer for teachers to use open source software?

(open hive: http://openhivescale.org/ , but apparently there are multiple projects: https://www.osbeehives.com/collections/source-files , … )

* YES! Positive professional pressure
* YES! Sustainability of the project!

Another set of workshops:

These could be such concrete (practical) offers for teachers.

* Monitoring your beehive with open source software and hardware.
* Automatically watering your flower with open source software.
* Run your own cloud on open source software.

There are different forms of workshops:

Development and Offer Workshops.

> next development workshop will help to develop strategy for offer workshops

> offered workshops are “offered to schools and teachers”

Topics for a workshop series

Open source and current questions; “Technology for everyone”

1. Logged in and out - How do I manage all the passwords in a safe way - with open source software.
2. Linux, the operating system for future (-) creators, basic introduction for teachers.
3. Bitcoin and crypto currencies - anon1138917760 do we teach future generations about the new digital economy?
4. Deep Internet, anon1138917760 do I get there with open source tools and why do I need to learn anon1138917760 to swim?
Material: https://darknetdiaries.com/

Why do we need to teach about this?

Children/pupils data is sold there, pupils might buy their drugs there, ...

5. What is a cloud and anon1138917760 do I use them - with open source software.
6. My wifi, anon1138917760 does it work?
7. Kids and the internet, what experiences are there?
8. Working on the Internet, anon1138917760 does a professional life start there? Students working extra?

What does attract teachers? Where will they walk away from? We focus on rephrasing the workshop titles.

Another strategy might be to host an event in a school, but to attract the parents, assuming that teachers than also would come (e.g. because they fear the next days all kids will speak about bitcoin [or any other of the above topic], but they - the teachers - don’t know anything about it).

Maybe we rephrase it with potential questions from children to teachers for each workshop topic? Or by opening a story from “everyday” school and teachers life?

Sustainability

Price: 0.200 Bitcoin cash ;) or 200 SEK ---> For the Blivande hosted event. >> think again about the message of the price.

Price: 10000SEK for a booked session at the local “school/educational center”.

* Or you could offer to come to schools >> who asks schools anon1138917760? >> we need a pitch deck? Website
* Contact local (walldorf) school for parent workshop offer

<image here> 
 

Hello, dear community! I am posting this in the Name of @anon3614937280. Looking forward to all the creative and thoughtful ideas and comments of yours!

 > # Call for use cases ideas for Disposable Identities.

# **The Need:**
**The goal is to take back the power and control of your own identity and to keep big cooperations  and governments from profiting off of it.** We need a multistakeholder governance on identity with citizens in charge together with SME (small companies) and inclusive tools from democratic organizations. ([disposableidentity.com](http://disposableidentity.com/) and [disposableidentities.eu](http://disposableidentities.eu/) coming soon.)


# **Who we are:**
**We are developing a technical solution for the generation of disposable identities for ""normal users.""** 

# **The Opportunity:**
**We will reach out to the best use case idea's and use our resources and technical know-anon1138917760 to develop your idea into a serious pitch or call application.**
You own your use cases and ideas are theirs. We offer to help in making it into a pitch for a pitch, portfolio, investors or making it ready to apply for an [NGI.eu](http://ngi.eu/) call. The next step to realising your DID idea!

# **The Call:**
*We ask you for the use cases you can imagine for such DiD's.*
Send your idea to Rob van Kranenburg at rob at [dyne.org](http://dyne.org/)


# **About DID's:**

The idea is that from a DiD a person can generate a disposable (limited in time, in purpose and scope) identity for each separate service (for example one for rent, one for the energy company, one for the water company) that can only be seen, controlled and traced back by the DID owner and that one specific service. So no one can aggregate services, nor are you ever fully exposed as a person unless you decide to, because you just send token/credential ‘enough money in the bank’ to rent, water and energy company as they just need to know that you can pay, not who you are.

Coding context: [zenroom.org](http://zenroom.org/)


# How it works

[Zenroom.org](http://zenroom.org/) allows you to get credentials from a CA, like for example “I’m above 18” and “I’m Belgian” and “today I have more than 1000 EUR in my bank”. Each credential is a crypto object, signed by the CA.

Each time you want to use any of these credentials, they get anonymized, so if you use them twice, they don’t look the same and can not be linked to each other and therefore not traced back to you.

# Example Use Case:
So for example, if you need to access a service that requires you to be 18+ and Belgian, you’d use those 2 anonymized credentials… the next day you use a different service that requires you to be 18+ and has 1000K EUR in your bank account, so you use those 2 other anonymized credentials: both times  **you effectively generated and used a disposable identity**, because only the CA could know who you are, but the services can only see that the CA signed the fact that you are Belgian, 18+ etc.

# Introduction into H2020 Call Context

Europe wants to become the leader in the field of collective intelligence and is uniquely positioned to do so. Its values of interoperability, privacy and decentralised power are foundational for an open web and the emergence of collective intelligence.

The upcoming [ICT-54-2020 call](https://www.ngi.eu/news/2019/07/23/ict-54-2020-call---blockchain-for-the-next-generation-internet/) allows a consortium of organisations to apply for an €8m funding pot of which they have to distribute €6m to outstanding academic research groups, hi-tech start-ups, SMEs and others, contributing to the research and innovation area via cascade funding model. The Commission considers proposals with an overall duration of 24 to 36 months. Third parties will be funded through projects, typically in the EUR 50,000 to EUR 200,000 range per project, with an indicative duration of 12 months.

**The deadline is January 16. 2020. (very tight)**

One of the subtopics of the call is:

**""Bringing forward the emergence of collective intelligence on the internet""**

* developing approaches for scientific understanding and technology-based stimulation of collective intelligence on social media and the internet to foster trustworthy knowledge and information sharing, and to enhance social inclusion. Focus is on two main use cases:
  1. develop new community-based service models on social networks that exploit collective intelligence to provide enhanced community services, and increase the availability of trustworthy content;
  2. in the context of collective intelligence develop and implement new concepts for connecting people and smart objects/agents/AI on social media.
* Approaches for both use cases must be rooted in scientific analysis of collective behaviour and network mechanisms, harness decentralised technologies such as P2P or blockchain for governance and support a dependable collective memory.

# Proposal Summary:

### WISDOM - Human & community centric incubator for P2P knowledge and collective intelligence software.

## Vision

The space of knowledge management and social media applications is dominated by players who's economic reward models force them to create lock-ins, therefore severely limiting the free flow of information, data and social interoperability and collective intelligence. Their centralised power allows them to be manipulated to spread low quality information, influence elections and abuse user's privacy and freedom of choice.

The web is already decentralised and interoperable. Therefore only funding organisations with new decentralised technologies, like Blockchain, won't solve these issues. 
To get another leap forward in the web's potential to foster collective intelligence we need to also change the economic models and recreate an environment of human centric & ethical service design, freedom-of-provider-choice (open markets) and democratic peer2peer communication. 

We believe that 4 components are key for achieving this:

1. Economic and business models that
   * align with the principles of interoperability by implementing investor reward models that cap returns and make organisations non-tradeable (like Steward Ownership, Cooperatives, NPOs, Open Science Research, Open Source Output)
     * Those models need to prevent a growth-at-all-cost mindset and incentivise organisations to be service/profit oriented instead.
   * protect user data from being sold as a commodity and out of hands of (European) citizen
   * create incentives for organisations to collaborate more on shared infrastructure so they can grow together, not alone, and overcome the tragedy of the commons.
2. Interoperability to create USPs of freedom and perfectly user adapted tools that monopolistic organisations have a hard time competing with. Interoperability should be implemented with special focus on:
   1. Data Portability
   2. Social interconnectivity (allowing users to switch providers and still communicate with their 'old' peers & social connections, like email)
   3. User centric adaptability: Users can easily experiement & upgrade to state-of-the-art technologies and protocols outside of a single company's control.
   4. Algorithmic freedom to democratise people's ability to control their information diet and bubble
   5. Modularity to enable user choice in service providers (e.g. using different default search engines in a browser)
3. Open Source software to create shared infrastructure and lower development costs
4. On/offline facilitation to foster emergent, scalable & co-creative communities, and individual/leaders that are aligned with their self and purpose.

## Incubator Program

The proposed incubator program for P2P knowledge and collective intelligence tools aims to grow a community of economically sustainable organisations that co-develop the technological, economical and social infrastructure for increasing the capacity for collective intelligence online.

It's key components are: 
* Communicating and co-evolving [a larger vision of collective intelligence](https://community.worldbrain.io/t/why-worldbrain-io-does-not-take-venture-capital/75) that is made possible by interoperable and hyper-adaptable human centric knowledge/social software and non-exploitative economic models.
* Preferring applicants that
  * use investor reward models that do not create incentives for growth-at-all-cost but for being service focused, like Steward Ownership or Cooperative models. VC or ICO funded companies will only be accepted in special cases, where such a focus can be successfully argumented.
  * use business models that protect privacy/data ownership and user data from being sold as a commodity
  * develop modular software & apply interoperable standards/protocols
* Facilitating a individualised learning/acceleration journey for teams and individuals in:
  * human centred product & service design
  * ethical principles of next generation social and knowledge software
  * anon1138917760 to build businesses that can sustain themselves before funding period ends
  * personal development to increase leadership skills and ethics, and ability to collaborate with peers
  * the ecology and interconnectivity of the proposed solutions
  * organisational development to determine value systems, purpose and directions
* Faciltiating on/offline community with battle-tested practices for emergent community design to stimulate knowledge transfer and shared (software) development
  * previous approaches have resulted in anon2726675500 co-creation and shared direction between projects, and therefore lower efficiency of deployed money.

# Consortium Partners & Roles:
## Technology Partner: [WorldBrain.io](http://WorldBrain.io)

[WorldBrain.io](http://worldbrain.io) is a steward owned company developing open-source, offline-first & P2P knowledge and collective intelligence applications.

Their role in the consortium is:

* providing modular, reusable, open source boilerplates for offline-first & p2p knowledge & collective intelligence applications to speed up development of new tools.
  * Memex: A online research tool to full-text search web history, annotate, co-curate and discuss web content, and collaborate with peers.
  * Storex: A user controlled, interoperable and adaptable storage layer for knowledge management data. This modular library powers the search and storage of Memex and allows developers to
    * flexibly adapt an application backend to any platform (web, mobile, browser extension), database/search technology (MongoDB, SQlite) and transport protocol (Http, IPFS, Ethereum).
    * build translators for any data model to enable emergent interoperable user-centric communication standards
* pulling in a network of activists, policymakers, entrepreneurs and investors that are aligned with the provided vision to engage as mentors, funders and partners.

This is the first part of the proposal outlining the general direction: 
## 1.1.1 Project Vision

Europe wants to become the leader in the field of collective intelligence and is uniquely positioned to do so. Its values of interoperability, privacy and decentralised power are foundational for an open web and the emergence of collective intelligence. It has credibility as a champion of the human-centric internet through its regulatory muscle flexing (the GDPR, Vestager, net neutrality). Now it has an important opportunity to take charge of also building technological solutions as well as new social and economic models that could support a human/community-centric alternative to compete with the dominant narrative of Big Tech and Venture funding. 

Today, the space of knowledge management and social/collective media applications is dominated by organisations that have an economic incentive to continuously grow-at-all-costs to reward investors. With these reward models organisations losing users or profit directly influences the profit margin of investors and create a need for 'infinite' growth. This incentivises the creation of lock-ins, as well as exploitation of the environment, workers and users. Data and social lock-ins limit innovation, open markets, the free flow of information and the capacity for collective intelligence. 

The web in itself is decentralised and interoperable, but still severely centralised in the past 30 years. New decentralised technologies like Blockchain will not solve these issue on their own. To really create an open web and collective intelligence it is of crucial importance to simultaneously tackle the economic incentives, software development paradigms and methods of collaboration. Problems like trustworthy information sharing, problem solving and enhanced social inclusion are directly dependent on our society's capacity for collective intelligence.

The Next Generation Internet initiative, with its broad and ambitious scope, provides us with an incredibly powerful opportunity to shape new economic dynamics from the ground up, experiment with new approaches and provide boilerplate models that can be replicated across Europe and in other industries.  

The goal  for the WISDOM initiative is to grow a community of economically sustainable organisations that co-develop the technological, economical and social infrastructure for increasing the capacity for collective intelligence. 

WISDOM aims to do so by establishing an incubator program & co-development community for Open Source & P2P knowledge and collective intelligence tools using ethical business models & investor reward models with capped returns (like 'Steward Ownership'. See chapter 1.3.3) that give them the economic freedom to: 

- align themselves with the principles data portability & ownership, social interoperability, privacy, as well as human & community centric innovation
- collaborate on shared infrastructure & research, and overcome the tragedy of the commons
- act socially responsible by improving value chain sustainability and working conditions
- sustainably grow together as a community/market, instead of growing-at-all-costs as individual organisations

The incubator members and its partners are world-class experts in individual, group and organisational facilitation using battle tested on-and offline methods to: 

- co-develop and articulate an ambitious vision for what we want the Next Generation Internet to be, involving diverse thought leaders and domain experts in the process
- increase intra and inter organisational alignment and shared directions to avoid scattered deployment of funds
- surface areas for co-development & co-research and increase impact of deployed NGI funds
- increase sharing of industry specific knowledge, and peer-learning in organisational design & leadership

The consortium, its partners & supporter network bring together deep expertise about the internet and related technologies. Our varied backgrounds as entrepreneurs, data scientists, digital humanities experts, policymakers, activists and civil society actors allows us to take a multidisciplinary approach to developing this vision and its values. Our strong standing and experience as current partners in the NGI ensures we can rapidly build and iterate upon the exciting work we have already been doing in the past. 

## 1.1.2 Project objectives and key performance indicators

### **Objective 1:**

Increase the web's capacity for collective intelligence through a holistic approach of supporting interoperability & human/community centric service design, sustainable investor reward models and business models, and facilitation methods to optimise for maximum cross-organisational collaboration.

### **Objective 2:**

Grow a value & purpose-aligned community of independently economically sustainable organisations that co-develop the technological, economical and social infrastructure for increasing the capacity for collective intelligence. 

### Objective 3:

Create a replicable boilerplate of technological concepts, open-source software modules, facilitation methods and economic reward models that can be used by other governments to kickstart local and national collective intelligence efforts, and sanon1138917760 success metrics to convince the larger market to invest in these companies and ecosystems. 

### Objective 4:

Create an economic space with increase service competition and maximum potential for collaboration on shared infrastructure to solve the tragedy of the commons. 

# **1.2	Relation to the work programme**

*Indicate the work programme topic to which your proposal relates, and explain anon1138917760 your proposal addresses the specific challenge and scope of that topic, as set out in the work programme.*

### ""Shape a more human-centric evolution of the Internet.""

To **shape a more human-centric evolution of the Internet** it not only requires a focus on privacy and data ownership, but also to provide great services for individuals and groups. In the current server-client model powered by companies who's investor models incentivise growth-at-all costs, user data is centralised in a few big companies that offer the exact same services for billions of users. To generate this growth companies often rely on providing free/cheap services for users that then sell user data or advertisement in return, thus violating privacy and data ownership. 

To retain this growth, organisations create lock-ins that reduce service innovation because users can't easily move to services that serve their needs better, and new service have troubles entering existing markets with innovative products. 

The incubator focuses on organisations with investor rewards models that are not incentivising growth-at-all costs, like Steward Ownership, as well as software products that provide data portability and social interconnectivity. With the cohort of companies in the incubator we aim to grow a nucleus for a small economy of knowledge software products to recreate the free market dynamics that lead to the explosion of innovation and human/community centric services of the early web and early modern economy. 

### ""Promoting interoperability and strengthening the role of Europe in international standardisation""

In the currently dominant reward models where investors make profits through the increase of speculative value, or get indefinite profit dividends by holding shares, every user or profit lost means less profit for investors. Interoperability anon1138917760ever would make it possible that services loose users more easily, therefore those investor reward models strongly disincentivice interoperability and collaboration on shared infrastructure like standardisation efforts.

To promote interoperability it is important to not just develop interoperable products but change the investor rewards models too. 

The incubator focuses on organisations with  investor rewards models where organisations can loose profits and users without reducing investor returns. This gives those organisations the economic freedom to be interoperable. With our strong focus on faciliating collaboration between the teams of the incubator we aim to increase co-development on shared infrastructure like standards or software modules. By having 10-20 successful organisations with potentially millions of combined users developing shared standards, it could lead to a strong role of Europe in driving the open and human centric development of international standardisation. 

### ""Service models for community services building on collective intelligence and novel approaches for connecting people and smart objects/agents to stimulate use of collective intelligence [...] develop new community-based service models on social networks that exploit collective intelligence to provide enhanced community services,

The lock-ins created by the services people use today, innovation on novel approaches to connecting people is heavily limited. Those lock-ins make it hard/impossible to migrate to other services, extend services with new technologies (like using different p2p protocols in the browser or messengers), or freely connect different people, services, devices and smart objects.

Because collective intelligence needs needs the free exchange of information, these lock-ins severely limit the potential for collective intelligence.

The incubator's concept of an open-source, interoperable, steward-owned economy is designed to incentivise innovation for human/community centric service models, enable the free flow of information and as a result the emergence of collective intelligence in the magnitude of the early web. 

### ""developing approaches for scientific understanding and technology-based stimulation of collective intelligence on social media and the internet to foster trustworthy knowledge and information sharing, and to enhance social inclusion. [...] Increase the availability of trustworthy content

The problem of a lack of trustworthy knowledge and increase in misinformation is not only about the availability of quality information, but people experiencing information overload. It takes time and skills to understand a topic or piece of content well enough to not be misinformed. So it is easy to be misinformed given the plethora of topics and facts people are exposed to today.

However everyone is doing online research and gathers trustworthy knowledge useful to others. Due to the existing data and social lock-ins people can only share a fraction of the cognitive process, the quality content they read, background information they find or thoughts they have. If people could share a more complete picture of their subjective research and memory, they could help each other to find trustworthy information and understand more topics deeper, faster and with more perspectives.

Every person stores, processes and communicates such knowledge in different formats and apps. It is critical that applications helping users to sort, evaluate, curate and share this knowledge are adapted to the individuals workflows, provide algorithmic freedom and communicate with interoperable protocols. Creating such a diversity of services with a high degree of **social inclusion** can neither be achieved by a single company nor the current investor reward paradigms that incentivise organisations to build services with as many users as possible.

To solve this problem it is fundamental to have a human/community centric, interoperable network of many independent knowledge services that are highly adapted to individual's needs. To increase the availability of trustworthy content, users need flexibility to innovate on new models to  information through algorithmic freedom. 

As described in the sections above, to achieve this kind of development and implementation of ""**new concepts for connecting people and smart objects/agents/AI on social media""** it is required to change the economic incentives for organisations to enable the free flow of information and increase of service innovation. 

The incubator's concept of an open-source, interoperable, steward-owned economy is designed **""Generate new business opportunities and new Internet companies with maximum growth and impact chances.""** to create the needed diversity of services. 

The aim is to grow an initial nucleus of an economy where organisations have the maximum innovation, growth and impact chances as an interoperable ecosystem/market not as single internet companies. We believe it will be virtually impossible to grow a single ethical knowledge/social media organisations that can compete with Facebook/Google/Twitter, by trying to play the same winner-takes-all game. Even Google+, with $600m in funding, Google's network effects and financial resources failed. 

### Create a European blockchain ecosystem integrating research and innovation communities.

Through our network of community partners like IPFS, Dat, Ethereum and Holochain we are integrating international research and innovation communities in the advisory process. Their European community members are invited to apply with their blockchain based projects 

The main focus of the incubator is more broadly P2P and offline-first applications, not only blockchains, as they are only one of many options in the P2P toolchain that can be used to achieve data ownership, privacy and interoperability. Using also requires careful consideration that is highly dependent on the specific use case. Only limiting applicants on blockchain based technologies would severely limit the opportunities for impact of this initiative and incubator. 

One of the evaluation principles of the incubator is the degree of user centric adaptability that enables users/developers/entrepreneurs to experiment with different transport protocols to power communication and storage of applications outside of a single company's control. User centric adaptability also enables services to gradually migrate their infrastructure to blockchain technologies as they become more market ready. 

# 1.3. Concept:

In order to bring a large scale shift in society's capacity for collective intelligence & collaboration, it requires the simultaneous work on the technological, economical and social paradigms. The goal is to maximise collaboration on shared infrastructure, human/community-centric innovation and competition on services. 

WISDOM is an incubator program with a unique combination of principles capable of creating a human-centric European internet economy that becomes a fertile ground for collective intelligence and collaboration at scale. 

To do so we combine the four elements of interoperability, open-source software, Steward Ownership economics and facilitation of individual, team and community growth.

## 1.3.1. **Interoperability**

The incubator has a special focus on organisations that provide and add research on data portability, social interconnectivity and human/community-centric adaptability. Implemented correctly, it creates an environment where users can move to other services without frictions and still communicate with peers using other tools (Example: SMTP/email).
Human/community-centric adaptability enables users/developers experiment & upgrade to state-of-the-art technologies, protocols & data-models outside of a single service's control. (Example: Wordpress plugins). Users being able to adapt according to their needs creates a way for emergent interoperability & standardisation that is born out of the real world use cases of communication, instead of top-down standardisation. This adaptability could also express itself in the ability for users to get algorithmic freedom which can democratise people's ability to control their information diet and **foster trustworthy knowledge and information sharing**. 

Such interoperability **creates an open market** with an increase in service competition & consumer choice on better and more ethical services. Interoperability also naturally limits the maximum individual growth of organisations because they will only be able to hold as many customers as they are the best services for. This creates external pressure for organisations to be service-oriented, not to dominate markets. Not even Google managed to overtake SMTP with Gmail.

The incubator is working together with leading individuals and organisations in the field, like IPFS, Dat, SSB community, W3C, [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) and the NGI teams. 

## 1.3.2. Modular Open-Source-Software

Enables developers to easily innovate on existing services without reinventing the wheel and thus more easily start profitable businesses and **increase service-competition & consumer-choice**. 

A modular development approach ensures that the developed components can be reused not only by the organisations funded by the incubator, but also in the larger ecosystem. The developed components also offer a great focal point for collaboration and the ability to drastically reduce development costs. 

## 1.3.3. Steward Ownership:

Steward Ownership is an economic reward model for organisations that gives them economic freedom to be interoperable, service oriented and socially responsible, not to lock people in, exploit the environment or workers in order to grow-at-all-costs to reward investors.

Steward Ownership companies cannot be sold on the open-market because of non-profit foundations that either fully own the company or have a golden share to veto a sale. People taking risk in investing time or money are rewarded with a capped profit share. These mechanisms remove greedy behaviour for growth-at-all costs while still incentivising growth and rewarding taking risks and entrepreneurial crafts. 

Steward Ownership companies' ability to be interoperable and socially responsible exists because the capped profit-share allows organisations to lose users/profits without lowering the total returns of investors. This also gives those organisations the economic freedom to be socially responsible so there is less need for regulation of bad actors that exploit users, employees or the environment because of unlimited profit interests.

With the current investor reward models, organisations often tend towards growing as fast as possible with free/cheap services where ads and exploiting user data are often the only remaining business models. 
SO organisations need to make profit in order to reward investors. It additionally creates incentivises for those companies to become good at providing human/community-centric services instead of growing-at-all-costs.

Invented by Zeiss/Bosch, it is a model that exists for over 125 years and is used by companies like Mozilla, Ecosia, Buffer, Carlsberg & John Lewis. In Germany Steward Ownership organisations employ ~1.2 million people and in Denmark there are over 1000 SO companies which control a quarter of the 100 largest corporations. Historically SO organisations have a 600% higher survival rate and thus create a more stable economy.
Promoting Steward Ownership structures is currently getting on the agenda of major funds and government's agends (CDU in Germany) and a shift away from a purely shareholder-value driven focus has entered the mainstream conversations, [like at the WEF](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/davos-manifesto-2020-the-universal-purpose-of-a-company-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/?fbclid=IwAR1G9FksiLdstX6G5CsQxJCbGqeqWeMaCkYNR9YUyKTz3FWkyDHG2s4Rhs4). 

Investing in Steward Ownership organisations is also in the interest of the European Union because organisations that have been funded by the EU cannot be sold outside of the EU. It not only keeps the economic potential inside the EU, but also prevents the data of citizen being owned by other companies without their consent as part of an acquisition, like it recently happened with Fitbit's health data and the sale to Google. 

## 1.3.4. Facilitation:

We consider facilitation of individual growth, team governance and inter-organisational collaboration as an often underdeveloped, but crucial aspect of collective intelligence. 

In order to have effective collaboration you need leaders and team members that possess emotional intelligence and shared purpose. 

Arriving there inherently means working through frictions stemming from different expectations, goals and personality traits that requires careful facilitation by professionals, and education of people in the process. 
By facilitating these interactions their is great gain to be made. 

- It allows to to uncover areas for potential collaboration on shared infrastructure like software modules and standards which can increase the impact of the funds deployed by NGI
- it increases the shared direction & vision of the community and creates focus for the funds deployed by NGI
- it increases the relationships and connections in the community
- it increases social inclusion because facilitations integrate individual's needs

## 1.3.5. An economy where it is more profitable to collaborate than to dominate
We believe the above mentioned 4 components create a positive feedback loop that fosters the emergence of an economy where: 

- it becomes **more profitable to collaborate than to dominate**
- **the tragedy of the commons can be solved**
- organisations mindset shifts from individually growing-at-all-costs to growing together as a community

This is because interoperable organisations need to focus on creating great services to a smaller audience (or lose them as customers) and therefore don't directly compete anymore against 90% of the market. As Steward Owned organisations they need to lower costs to return money to investors faster and thus have a financial incentive to collaborate with similar services on developing shared/public/open-source infrastructure (e.g. p2p modules or feature libraries like annotations). Since they can give away profits without lowering investor's total returns they can also be socially responsible by investing in public good infrastructure without profit interests. 

Facilitation in individual leadership, team management and inter-organisational collaboration can help increase the shared direction, uncover areas for co-development of infrastructure (software modules, data standards), create deeper relationships inside the community, and increase the impact of the funds deployed by H2020."

One question: anon1138917760 do you feel about the [platform coop](https://platform.coop/) discussion in relation to SO? Imo the ""cooperative renaissance"" (also see [this](http://disco.coop/manifesto/) on distributed cooperative organizations) is part of the move toward a different sense of ownership and a way to broaden the [public value](https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-value-of-everything/10136) discussion we have been having (whatever the limitations of refocusing innovation narratives to give state actors a larger role, the adoption of [mission-oriented research](https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe-next-research-and-innovation-framework-programme/mission-oriented-policy-horizon-europe_en) by the EU is a key dev).

>  But if steward ownership is to be a focus of the proposal it seems to me that cooperative data governance frameworks may play a role.

Re platform coops: Fully agree. I had them in the initial briefing more prominently positioned, but not in the recently sent update which was more focused on the general dynamic, less on the implementation. The next section I am working on is ""methodology"", where specific examples of Steward Ownership, like Platform Coops should be included. 
Glad you also mentioned the mission focused approach of the EC, will see anon1138917760 I can incorporate those. 

> In fact the coop discussion is a possible WP I could see us contribute to

I'd be great, if you can formulate a rough work package for that. Would help to get a better sense of what you have in mind there. 
Meaning: Objectives, Tasks and Deliverables across a 36month time frame (given only 30 months are incubation period)
Also important to note for the proposal is why your organisation would be uniquely positioned to provide value to that area."

[/quote]


One of the questions I have, from an outsider looking in, is the requirement to have an Operational Partner. I'm just curious if there is any willingness on a project basis to build this capability up in edgeriders, or otherwise instead of having a third party manage this. It is a bit like the business rational of subcontract versus do hiring internally — is this so specialized that it negates taking this on internally?

Or are there expectations from the funding organizations that a third party “audit and control” anon1138917760 things are executed? In the longer term, I'd see an organization that can both execute *and* manage their projects, capacity building… — *could* be a feature that is compelling to the funding organizations.

Please take this question *in kindness* where I am not questioning prior decisions, but simply seeking to understand."

Hi, as member of the DGOV community we have applied to other grants via the Institute for Innovative Governance Foundation as DGOV has no formal entity yet. I would be happy to take this role and also put lost of effort in the co-writing. I have experience with EU funding.

Warm regards,
Liliana.

Hi @anon4187089231 @anon796444895
I have contacted my DGOV colleagues/friends who participated in the previous proposals for Nesta Collective Intelligence with the Institute of Innovative Governance, the Esanon3386180186ian foundation that supports us: https://www.instingov.org/.

I have exchanged some messages on telegram with them, and here I am posting the last post, my invitation for them to join us over in this Edgeryders platform.  I hope that they join us :slight_smile: 

----

I think that we could join this proposal under the Institute of Innovative Governance (Esanon3386180186ian Foundation), the institution that supports us as DGOV already and that I put you all in contact with.  
I think that we could team up and support as researchers and facilitators of all governance aspects, coordination aspects.  I would love to move the conversation over there.  And I will published this same post on the edgeryders platform where we are getting organized for this proposal.

I suggest that we all read the proposal and suggest our personal contributions to this research.

There is a call anon3386180186ight about Collective Intelligence, and tomorrow evening there is another one for this proposal with Ruben (U Ghent researcher and lead developer/researcher for Solid).  The posts are on the Edgeryders platform also."

Dear @anon1199199125

thanks for dropping by and your interest to find a way to collaborate :slight_smile:

So what we are most urgently need right now is an operational partner that is trusted by the EC to handle the funds (and the associated bureaucracy). Of course an organisation taking this role is invited to be involved in other ways too, after all the paper work is the least fun part. 

I am not familiar with the research objectives of you or UB so I don't know where there would be another area of collaboration **yet**. It would be great if you were able to make it to our call anon3386180186ight at 8:30pm where we could dive deeper into those questions. If not, I am more than happy to jump on a call with you in the next days."

depends what you have in mind when asking ""also work with"". I was head of a Inria team between 2006 and 2013, I know a bunch of colleagues at Inria on their different sites (Paris, Nice, etc.). What team/people do you work with?"

I see. UB did endorse the fund management for opencare, a project we were involed in with EdegRyders. The management itself was two headed with myself and Alberto, which made sense since the vision was ER's while UB had the manpower and admin experience to run the funds and in a sense reassure the EC.
That being said, I won't personally be able to act as coordinator for this project as I actually am appointed as Vice-President at our University. I can ask a colleague whether he would be willing. I presume he would only jump in if he knows he'll get backed up by someone who's involved in designing the project.

You mean backed in doing the admin work by someone from the other consortium members?
In any case I think it would be wise to hire someone from the money we get to support with that work, and get the person/team the support they need from the other consortium members. I wouldn't want anyone to be solely responsible for that kind of bureaucracy. I'm certain we'll figure something out where everyone feels good with. 


> I actually am appointed as Vice-President at our University

Seems like a lot of work already :slight_smile:

We offer open source based web services such as fairchat, fairmeeting, faircloud or board.net. We help organisations and companies to avoid having their data hosted at the big five cloud providers. We are organized as a partner network and put all surplus into open standards, FLOSS and commons projects. Yet we also do a lot of consulting, helping our customers to migrate and be happy with FLOSS solutions. We did have experience with large EC funded projects, also in the role of a coordinator, but not recently. We are also involved in several social design projects, that aim at a more fair economy, such as Fair.Coop. We would love to share our experience  in various roles, as a facilitator, incubator or even as an active consortium member. Our bookkeeping and controlling is in-house and based on the Open Source tool ERPnext, which would easily allow to manage also larger funds. We do have accounting people in our team, but our not-for-profit organisation might be too small when it comes to an eligibility check for the organisational partner role.

I have contacted some people but so far from my side we haven't found a good lead applicant. Last Thursday, we spoke a bit with Oliver about this and one of the ideas was to have Edgeryders as the applicant. I am not sure if this was maybe spoken in the videocall.  I know that the admin of this is huge,... And I also know that we could work together to do that administration a group task, collectively. 

I have shared a budget template to Oliver. I have been communicating mostly via email. Sorry that I totally forgot to post things over here :slight_smile:

Adding a new partner like the P2P Foundation would probably not be a good move, and it is interesting to add it as network/support partner. 

Regarding my personal participation, I would like to check in if for the purpose of this proposal I could be considered an Edgeryders team member as I am a freelancer at the moment, I don't really have a formal strong partner to be part of. 

I would love to contribute to the community building of the incubator and support of the community with documentation and other resources like research on CI. By the way, do you have the recording of our community zoom call on Collective Intelligence?

# ""Open Proposal Writing"" Category

https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/applications

# Description:

This is a public open workspace in which you can craft your proposals, calls, project plans and similar.

In doing so you can get help and profit from the experience of other community members while simultaneously contributing to a growing knowledge base.

Proposal writing for grants, answering calls or wording them yourself, finding funding or partners are complex processes. Institutions have developed theses processes and brought them to a point where it is harder and harder to break into the systems from outside.

Here we have the opportunity to help each other as a free community of individuals to empower each other’s projects.

**What you can do here:**

* Post your 1st, 2nd or 3rd draft and get feedback and help
* Share and analyses successful and unsuccessful application experiences
* Read, give feedback and contribute to the drafts others have shared.

**Let’s help each other realising ideas that could help everyone!**

*Tips for what information to include:*

1. What is your project about? What’s the problem it solves and anon1138917760?
2. What stage are you in?
3. What call are you answering, grant are you applying for or what other goal do you have with the text/presentation you are crafting??
4. What do you need concrete help with? People? Skills? Guidance? Clarity?"

*In the context of the [Teaching Teachers Open Source](https://edgeryders.eu/t/teaching-teachers-open-source/9881), I had a friend with the dream to author a children's book on IT. Below are the thoughts I contributed to her:*

[ComputerCraft EDU v2](http://youtu.be/ADTb6ifxWxw) (Minecraft, version 2 has the simplified GUI) is very cute. Combining programming with Minecraft is a pretty promising environment to learn programming.

When I searched for [Curly Bracket](http://curlybracket.se/) I found a fun series from [Swedish Radio P1](http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt?programid=4741).

Currently I am reading Kevin Kelly's *""[What technology wants](https://www.goodreads.com/book/sanon1138917760/7954936-what-technology-wants)""*, and while it is true all technology and science is *""building on the shoulders of giants""* it becomes devastatingly clear to be the case with code. Increasingly, the features, the size of your lego blocks so to say, grow. Especially since the rise of Github, Pastebin and Stackoverflow (each of these merit their own essays you may read if you want to, but [here's a tweet](https://twitter.com/haoel/status/695490584325152768)), open collaboration is always too big to ignore. Incidentally, intense communication through tools various tools is also essential. Unless you're one of the best coders in the world, writing any substantial amount of code yourself is usually the wrong solution.

Anyway, I've thought about technology development a lot, combined with the nature of work. Most colleagues study outside of work hours to be able to do the work. I have some productivity addiction, which gets weird when it's some sort of knowledge you're producing, not chairs or other physical items. If I could just replicate work I've done over and over, or even teach it, it would be so efficient. But I'm forced to learn new things to keep up with development, reaching higher and higher levels of abstraction. Because this discrepancy - doing dishes will always take effort, teaching a team Git gets easier but learning new always take great mental effort, I've sketched a way of thinking of effort using different currencies, like time, money cost, experience required and mental effort (mana). So I'm a pretty high level IT wizard who can do a lot at even no cost, but it will cost time and mana. Also I get a specialization penalty for low mana tasks *(find reference on anon1138917760 anon3348677880 Stallman describe hackers as the wizards of the future?)*.

One concept important to systems and software development is the ability to assemble (and to take apart again). Many systems are like dolls, ready assembled and you won't open or change them. Open software anon1138917760ever at most comes partially assembled (legs, hands, whatever, parts always being reused for other models) but you will have the source code available and there are distributions that are made to be automatically assembled only on your computer. Back around 2000 getting a Linux system to work could take several days or weeks, but now I spawn new computers several times per day. It has led to the expression *""treat your servers like cattle, not pets""*, because if one misbehave you should be able to put it down and reproduce it from source. This beautiful process of bootstrapping never seize to amaze me and tools like autoconf, automake, gcc and yum make it happen.

Finally, I feel like I have studied too much. The accreditation of a masters degree (imagine a lengthy list of impressive courses and grades) is a terribly inefficient way to weed out who is fit for the job, especially since there are now MOOC trainings for most thinkable subjects, not rarely for free. I believe that while excellent in parts, for many jobs, the significance of university education will diminish in favor of more efficient qualifiers. However, while I have all this knowledge and experience, I have a passion to make the best use of it and enable others. Any way you can think of to take part in that would be pretty awesome."

I'm sorry for the cynical remark already, but we also got all the horrible side effects of factory farming together with this approach. In my view, servers rather need love, just like pets :blush:

Minimalism is a strong trend for dealing with the physical world already (Marie Kondo etc.). In the software world, we still see the total opposite: needlessly going for more stuff and more complexity even though it's already unmanageable ([yesterday's example](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-malicious-python-libraries-removed-from-pypi/)). I hereby declare that software minimalism is a thing from now on! :smile:"

Q: Why would someone do open source, rather than charge for a service?
A: (Alex) Charging for my service wouldn’t be compatible with the future I want.
Erik: Open source enables that as many people as possible can utilize your service.
So anon1138917760 do you make it economically sustainable? Eg. funds, corporate sponsors. Could we make decision work better? Could we make progressive funds (ie. escalating over time based on success)
“What do you think about decreasing expenses, rather than increasing prices?” We still need to be able to give developers enough to survive.
Types of open source: eg. libraries, Mastodon,

Q: Why is ‘freemium’ not viable? A: hard to implement it in a way that does not limit the use. Only works for software as a service. How about other services?
Are we looking at a new emerging way of open source? License 0 (ie. if you’re not a company and not making money off of it, it’s free). Parroting license - due diligence. Would make it possible for commercial users to be forced to pay for it.
A business model problem - we need good coders in bulk. Coders need to pay the rent. Rent is going up. Coders don’t want to be martyrs. Commercial employers pay well. How do you get enough money into a project to make it great?

Q: What types of open source projects are struggling with funding. Open source does not give return of investment for investors. Funders necessarily need to not be expecting direct returns.
‘Bundlesource’ ‘board of users’ that can take decisions on prioritizing features.
‘Tragedy of the commons’ half of our fundings come from one person who is on a monthly donation. Most other donors give small donations.
Eg. John says he gives up to 5€ a month, but only 1€ a month pr. one other person who also donate 1€ a month. If 5 people also give 5€ a month, they all give 5€ a month.

Q: Whcih business model for software is thriving? A: ads, venture capital, software as a service.
Q: What donation model works best? A: patreon, governments,  **churches** . Create a religion and make billionaires pay a shitload of money.
Discussing the potential for developers go on an international coding strike.
As a coder, if we are faced with the option between getting really well paid and doing what you believe in - it’s hard.
If stakeholders are small, independent people - does propaganda/outreach have a role to play? Could expand the base of donors. More users also mean more bug-fixing for individual people - lots of legwork.
How is open source understood: ‘The code that makes up the product is publicly available. The product itself is sometimes free too’.
If open source starts getting public traction, lobbyism starts becoming an opportunity. Microsoft is lobbying for their cases, open sources needs theirs.
Hb open source government? Resource allocation problem
Governments are becoming more fluent in understanding anon1138917760 data affects the public space. Very reactionary, not very progressive.
Scuttlebutt is aiming to find ways to live with decreased expenses (ie. less dependency on dominant system) to give more space for creating an alternative.
The movement needs salespeople! Churches are being successful raising money
Open source does offer the individual return of investment for the developer in terms of offering value to the community, which offers both a sense of purpose for the developer and goodwill from the community. To monetize this
Idea of making a documentary about open source. There’s a powerful narrative in offering an alternative to facebook, google, etc. ‘We don’t actually need any of it’. Point: raised awareness does not necessarily create. Lots of people are concerned about privacy.

## Main takeaways
Organize an open source strike
increase solidarity
Create a documentary to inform people
Start a religion, lobbying group
Incentivized donations (bigger donations give bigger rights? patreon)

Feedback from audience: Great idea with religion - religion is the opposite of economy, a place where exchange is not measured. Religion is mostly focused on  *giving service*"

I'm sharing this, because I think he touches on some things that are pertinent to the discussion we've been having here, and I'd be interested to hear what you think about smart cities:_

This week, we published a story from Nafeez Ahmed about [the American and other foreign companies that helped build China’s “smart cities.”](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/silicon-valley%E2%80%99s-scramble-for-china/) Those smart cities have become a feature of Xinjiang’s police state that now [persecutes Uyghurs](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/uyghur-women-fighting-china-surveillance/).

It’s a story about the dark side of a seemingly well-intentioned urban planning paradigm. Smart cities are supposed to be the bright future of high-density living, but China’s government has been using this technology for human rights violations.

But does it really take an authoritarian government to bring out the dark side of smart cities?

In the past few months, I’ve had a Google alert going for “smart cities,” hoping to keep abreast of where things are going. Almost every link Google sends me is celebratory, even utopian. Just this week, I’ve been sent articles calling smart cities the “Future of Urban Development” and a “Smart Future for Smart People.”

But there has been criticism as well, and a key one centers around a process that has seemingly anon2726675500 overlap with China’s drive to build a surveillance state: the rise of “surveillance capitalism.” Harvard’s Shoshana Zuboff, who coined the term, sees smart cities as a way for tech companies to expand the logic of surveillance capitalism – the endless accumulation of data to predict and modify human behavior for the benefit of advertisers – into the city.

Google’s projects in Toronto and New York, for example, have seen the installation of advertising technology on sidewalks, alongside free internet access kiosks. In other words, the logic of ad-supported platforms – free services in exchange for data – is literally being transferred onto the sidewalk. As David A. Banks puts it in [a recent column for Real Life Magazine](https://reallifemag.com/built-to-shill/), “With the surveillance technologies built into their Toronto and Hudson Yards projects, Google does to these buildings what they made billions doing to the internet: monitoring advertising opportunities.”

Chinese-style smart city police states may be on the horizon in the West. In the U.S., for example, one could imagine ICE using smart city tech to track migrants in border zones. But another more immediate threat, the privatization of public space for profit, as in Google’s Sidewalk Labs project, is already happening."

I soon realized that things were serious. I couldn't believe that such a scenario of “connecting everything with everything” was now being put forward as a positive systemic framework for the entire planet.

Realizing that the desired outcome was individuating all objects and embedding reading and sensing capabilities in a subgroup, I started looking into the Electronic Product Code (EPC) Global Object Name Service (ONS) schemes of building an ONS for all objects and goods. I saw hardware costs fracture and hardware boards in cheap print, and I found myself in a very curious state from 2000 to 2004. Then RepRap, the brainchild of Adrian Bowyer (later giftwrapped by MIT as Fab Lab), hit the street, and open hardware 3D printing started taking over manufacturing.

In response, I cofounded Bricolabs in 2004 with Denis “Jaromil” Roio of [dyne.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/dyne.org), Felipe Fonseca of MetaReciclagem, Bronac Ferran of the Arts Council England, and Matt Ratto ([http://criticalmaking.com](http://criticalmaking.com/)). Hackers and activists began to formulate positive visions of agency over this space (https://mailinglists.dyne.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/brico). One example of such agency is the Dowse network appliance ([http://dowse.eu](http://dowse.eu/)), a building-block resulting from the work of [dyne.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/dyne.org). At the time, I would think to myself, “OK, there is a Matrix plan. It is un-hackable. It is like air. Should we go off the grid? Or do we have our own agency?”

One perspective on anon1138917760 to address this is to try to integrate smart contracts, distributed data models and IoT technology to keep the sensor data contextual, rather than have it flow into huge datasets controlled by companies or governments. Many groups around the world are experimenting with this. In many ways, I don't see many other ways forward. Sensors connected to networks *will* be everywhere in just a few years, that is pretty much inevitable at this point. Benefits are too huge for governments and companies to ignore. What needs to happen is that a ""human-centric"" model that keeps your data in the context where it belongs, and secured by smart contracts and cryptography, becomes good enough and open enough that it just makes sense for companies and governments to use it.

Making such sensory data available to anyone who wants it, and making it irreversibly linked to contracts that only allow its use in limited contexts, is one approach to reap the benefits while doing some damage control to avoid complete dystopia. In broad terms, every time data is 'emitted' by a sensor, that data would be coupled to a contract in a distributed ledger (like a blockchain), available to everyone. Decoding the data can only be done by negotiating the contract to gain access to a key with which to decrypt it."

I can understand a lot of feelings and first impressions of Millennials about what looks like to them a connected world 'all of a sudden' or a situation that can be 'avoided'. Me and friends confronted that as a situation 20 to 15 years ago and have been painstakingly working towards creating building blocks for the best possible b lance between centralization and decentralization. We look at that world in a realistic  way, meaning there is no romantic way out, no naive escape, of course if you want there is still a temporary bubble you can build with a few friends - but we are working for the best and most inclusive zone of connectivity for everybody, every person and as we pay taxes in Europe, that for us is Europe."

We need to move to debate further from this seemingly deadlocked polarised state
it appears we are at now. Distributing yourself as data into the environment has been the revolving wheel of progress for our conceptions and applications of technology. Location-based, real-time – services, applications to strengthen communities, and the capacity to generate high quality data in information overload, these are all possibilities within a wired connected environment that need serious exploration and research.

In Art and Agency, an Anthropological Theory47, Alfred Gell puts emphasis “upon art
as a form of instrumental action: the making of things as a means of influencing the thoughts and actions of others”. He defines volt sorcery as the “practice of inflicting harm on the prototype of an index by inflicting harm on the index, for example, sticking pins into a wax image of the prototype”. In Gell’s theory the index is located in the region where the sphere of agency (the primary agent) overlaps with the vulnerability of thecausal milieu of the recipient. In our case the index is located in the region where the sphere of agency of the firmware on the hard disks (control) overlaps with its openness to different practices and interpretations by the hive software. The question is, can we immobilize or reformulate the subject (the set of business practices and real people articulating their agency through these business practices of patents and intellectual property laws) in this way? Seizing and scheming towards this opportunity to make sense, to have fully analyzed and grasped a situation – such as the recent individual agency in open source content-networks-software and hardware – will not lead to major organizational, political, and design breakthroughs, if we are not able to fully grasp the trajectory from thing as gathering places for spaces and discussion, from ‘matters of concern’:

“A heuristic use of the term ‘thing’ has also been adopted by Bruno Latour, who, after Heidegger, has worked to transform the semantic emphasis of ‘things’ from ‘matters of concern’. Drawing on older etymologies in which ‘thing’ denoted a gathering place, a space for discussion and negotiation; Latour has rehabilitated this sense of the term as a way out of the twin cul-de-sac of constructivism and objectivity”.

The story is no longer metaphor, no longer as if or ‘as’ something else, no, the story is the thing now, it is the protocol.

perfection that we see. But is it not the same for the sciences? How many discoveries which immortalized their authors were prepared for by the work of the preceding centuries, even having been developed to their maturity, right up to the point that they demanded only one more step to be taken? And not to leave watch-making,
why do we not esteem those to whom we owe the fusee, the escapement, and the repeating works [of watches] as much as we esteem those who have successively worked on perfecting algebra? Moreover, if I can believe those philosophers who do not so despise the mechanical arts that they refuse to study them, there are certain machines so complicated, and in which all the parts depend so much on each other, that it is difficult to imagine that the invention would be due to more than one man”.

Not only is the mechanical seen as a collaborative effort and process, but the mechanical arts are thought on the same conceptual level as the arts and the sciences, especially because the knowledge gained and the theories put forward build upon layers and
layers of collaborative practical experience. The project of the Encyclopédie is the starting point for all questions relating to the Enlightenment and “the project of the modern library itself”. Yet does this mean that there is no other reading possible in the intentions of the authors of this paradigm of classification? Le Rève d’Alembert (1769, first published 1820) sanon1138917760s that for Diderot seeing the world no longer as God but as machine, and seeing Nature as a giant evolutionary organism that is never static but always experimenting, is not contradictory at all. Maybe the process of and will to classify is not the key to begin to dismantle neoliberal capitalism. But if not, then what?

According to Jens Kastner: “However the transnational guerilla may be seen as a try
to overcome the frequencies of fields between art and activism described by Bordieu. The respectively own logics of production of theory, art and also politic actions sanon1138917760 overlapping and entanglement. This is the basis where it is meant to prepare - anon1138917760ever not by identical closements or prefaced contextless communities. But as a transnational guerilla”.

But it has to be understood as a gutsy, temporary rout not limited to national borders.All these qualities have been coined and developed from a different mindset and frame of thought, culminating in Bricolabs, the collaborative narrative of individuals that investigate, exploit and prototype the loop of open source software, content, spectrum and hardware. Unlike Jens Kastner our trajectory to these qualities as a possible reality for ‘uncapitalism’ on a global level did not unravel itself through an investigation of the common denominators in the oppositional positions that have all claimed in some way or another the predominance of becoming/das Tun/anti-classification. Our trajectory to these qualities comes from the realisation that old and new technologies such as RFID, biometric identification schemes (gait recognition, intelligent tracking video cameras and on chip DNA testing), active sensor schemes in logistics, clothing, home - are in the process of creating a real world in which connectivities expand beyond our conscious schemes and protocols of interaction.

Personally I like the idea of (4) as it's a move away from centralisation, I think we need to decentralise physically as well as digitally.  But realistically it feels to me that education and campaigning are feasible initial steps and that might lead towards (1) where standards, policies and controls have been design specifically for humanity. 

You are right, technologies often get abused - Facebook is a great example.  I wonder what standards and controls would be considered at the conception of Facebook if they knew what they know now."

Yes, that is extremely simplified but true. And to get to this level of simplicity took me and a lot of networks twenty years of fighting against the grain, and being misunderstood, as if we would be on the side of the Matrix, where in fact to us the potential for emancipation and a better balance between centralization and decentralization was on par with seeing animals, humans, machines and the planet itself as a caring and sustaining ecosystem. #IoT means transparency and exposing overhead and corruption. The balance I seek, was very well described by Malatezsta and Machno and can also be described as anarchocommunism (open on the services, closed on a public commons infrastructure). The current NGI 3step plan is exactly that. 

My interest lies in building a stable political zone of human machine complimentarity, supporting humans in what they do best: ultimately Nietzsche's love and shame and for #IoT full resource management as our only chance against Climate Change. 

This may be hard to grasp for people who are different than me, and most are. Most people have specific self interest. Mine is simply to be continue living in a stable society. That requires new political models and new political leadership.
One of the first public mentions to my plan to turn the passport into a device is 2011:
https://robvankranenburgs.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/a-proactive-vision-on-a-full-internet-of-things-where-the-lights-are-on-all-is-transaction-and-engineered-narrativity/

I still think it is valid. That means the logical trajectory now if we do not act is 500 smart cities aka military zones and Mad Max in between. I do not want to live in neither.

So, Inge, you see, that without taking control the drivers of the digital transitions our societies can not survive. I live in a simple street. I would like to keep living three and be abler to take a train and have a coffee in a bar. That is all.
Again, hard to understand if you are of a different sensibility that I have no other interest in this then general interest. The selfish aspect lies in the fact that this stable society enables me to work and live as I want, quiet and simple.

My friends and my networks are willing to take up that position, to build leadership in a fully connected world. I hope edgeryders do too. Otherwise it is very easy from our own cosy and sheltered positions ( me too!) to say anon1138917760 bad it all is, and anon1138917760 afraid we are of the Matrix. That's too simple for us. 

Now to your specific question. I see a pattern there, interesting. 

To me, all current systems are dysfunctional. Hence we need to build better ones. That is my sole objective.

The world is full of terrible political features. If you are not careful you can get depressed by simply looking at one. What can you do? In Georgia the most repressing and backward laws are voted on abortion. Why not stage protest there? Extremely necessary!

Yes, people worry, and so can I.

But, we are in the Strategy CSA of the Next Generation Internet at the moment and from us new architectures and new ways of seeing are expected that work back from a position of full connectivity to building the best and most inclusive zone of care for ALL (human beings, animals, machines, plants and the planet).

Ours if not to bite one bullet, focus on one situation existing now and extrapolating from that or excluding building blocks.

In the previous eetings we realized that without a system perspective actively taking control of all these building-blocks a commercial social credit system is already forming as we speak combined of commercial services embedding dynamic pricing on commercial algos , the mapping behavior sets that are downloadable in JSON format from coelition.org embedded soon if not already in voice and camera supported services in home, shop and hospitals.

The Matrix is already here, everywhere. Our job is to find the pressure points of agency and make it work for all of us, meaning we find a way (and wade are finding it) to not have a subset of people and machines looking at all the data but open it up in such a way that  e v e r y o n e is able to see all the data realtime, thus brokering new notions of mediation, and conflict management and that is where all skills and expertise can found in anarchist literature,

This is more for what I stand for.  But it's not realistic at the moment, the only time we will stop at scale is when there is incentive (through force | desire) to do so.  If we wait for top-down direction based on the “their” opinion of “when we have to do it” it will be far too late and any solution thereafter is likely to be the wrong one driven by the wrong values, and fear. But maybe we can tap into the desire to do so, bottom-up.

The Armish for example live simple lives and in contrast to popluar belief with technology.  They ride in horse and carriage because all of them can do so equally, they use electricity because it is a utility accessible to all of them, they do not have tractors because their neighbour could buy a bigger tractor and competition would enter their community.  Each new technology available to them is considered and either integrated or rejected.  Their value systems are different to the majority of the western world and they know anon1138917760 to ""stop"" or rather not even start.   I believe we need to have something similar, a set of values and standards to refer to when considering if we _need_ 5G and smart sensors, etc, the real impact on humanity and if we need them the controls and constraints around them for their purpose. Though I have be mistaken for a Luddite I really am not, I simply call for a more cognitive decision making process based on human-centric needs when considering whether we ""should"" rather than whether we ""could"".

I appreciate the mention of Nietzsche.  I fully back a need to manage resources more carefully.  A project I set up a few years ago which I need to restart aims at[inspiring the next generation of ecologically aware creative technologists](http://www.adventurelabs.co.uk/2017/11/27/a-mission-working-towards-2050/) to do just that in ways we haven't yet thought of.   

It feels like we are concerned and challenging the same issues from slightly different standpoints.  I'm currently trying to avoid London atm, I'm living out in the hills of the Peak District as part of my effort to decentralise and also focus on the natural environment around me.  

I'd would like to meet up (remotely or in person, maybe in Georgia if we could fund the travel) at some stage to consider our current positions and anon1138917760 they might compliment each other in a simplified and unified approach. Maybe @anon2855557573  would be interested in that conversation too and maybe it is something to consider for the festival.  I think one of our tasks would be to simplify the heuristics and collaborate on an accessible concept derived from our collective concerns, understandings and approaches - though it may also turn out that we have a need to continue our different approaches.

Would there be interest in this from others?"

You were clearly (way)  too early.
I think it is more about timing. Now is the time for these arguments. I am studying the Amish too, for example, this kind of thinking runs parallel. If you read http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/?q=node/108 and just check out the last page you see we were/are on a similar track. We just keep on keeping on making the arguments until the threshold of seeing this as more normal is reached. This is happening, so now is a time to push again.

To finish and to instigate a discussion, we propose a series of indicative standards that test the waters, raise awareness and make visible the gap between where we are now and where have to go. The triple challenges of climate change, peak oil and social breakdown are coming. The question is not if, but when. Our standards are a shock therapy to the current practice of making. The sociability standards are workable and stem directly from the urgen- cies we have discussed. They will ensure interoperability between all the emerging actors. They require the joining of different actors that so far have not been involved in the making of standards. 

All technological standards are also social standards.

On you four points that you propose

“Create standards and influence design of smart cities to protect/enhance humanity (very hard)’

In projects like Tagitsmart we have worked towards standardization  of smart tags and product passports so as to have a chance to go to full recycling and circular economy In retail. A very small steps but small steps is what it is. 
Projects like Sociotal.eu, D-CENT, DECODE, Commonfare http://pieproject.eu is to demonstrate that all technological standards are social standards, so what was thought up theoretically a decade ago now becomes practice. Again,  not fully ortganised, this is the flow of things.

In Barcelona, Amsterdam and NY these notions of data privacy and commons are put into action. 
Amsterdam is in our current CSA. WE will make a Digital Signature for a 5G Architecture real.

We propose grey zones (current 3G/4G) hot spots (dedicated 5G zones) and cold spots.

Some people in edgeryders seem to me more about disconnecting, then connecting which surprises me but is actually anon2298377336 good as it forces us to have this discussion deep and in the open. Nice!

I am preparing salons on hot spots but also on cold spots (one with Brussel based 
https://ps.lesoiseaux.io

As I think all three type of zones are our responsibility as architects of hybridity.

You and others are very welcome to join that cold spot (no 'connectivity/wireless') workshop. 

In the 5G workshops in my Task Force Infrastructures we address exactly this issue. You are very welcome to join. I can also send you the notes:

""How can we ensure not making the same mistakes as with the (failed) smart city (applications), but co-create services in the vertical applications (body/health, home/energy, car/sharing, region/collective intelligence) with all stakeholders including citizens? In this workshop we want to investigate the procedure of embedding these ideas and requirements in a Digital Signature for the Infrastructure. This has the important bonus it no longer matters who hosts the data and which platforms it runs, as the liability, accountability, procurement, GDPR and Cybersecurity Act compliance is in situational contracts (term Christian Nold), thus ensuring the new insights (fostering new services) stay well known to all stakeholders. In earlier workshops of NGI Forward WP3 the realization was made that in these 5G environments all entities (whether persons, goods, objects or situations) will be given federated and temporary identities, as in the case of an accident with the connected car in which all ‘stakeholders’ (the car, the person, the lantern pole that is hit, the water that the crashes into that is polluted…) receive temporary identities the ensemble of which becomes the ‘virtual accident’ the liability and accountability is administered on. Currently eIDas is the digital signature for persons, GS1 is providing product codes (‘passports’) for goods and coelition.org is mapping and numbering everyday activities. In these environments AI will run in the network and robotic capabilities are built in to function semi-auanon3386180186omously, the agency to name the combinations of the temporary and federated (attribute-based) identities will be vital to creating new services. Currently this agency is in the hands of GAFA and BAT.

In the case of architectures the first Salon put forward four building blocks.  The first is that in an Internet of Humans, or Next Generation Internet, trust can be tokenized but only within a situation of already established trust between people, meaning there has to be a social understanding before it can be technically articulated, can we talk about communities and everyday life. The second is successful anticipatory regulation: “joint-up multidisciplinary regulation through collaboration platforms on AI that include startups, think-tanks and academia, large and medium-sized companies, governments and their ethics commissions, civil society and activists.”The third is to explore building institution like entities with the concepts of data utilities and the work of Neil Lawrence and Sylvie Delacroix who propose data trusts as a bottom-up mechanism whereby data-subjects choose to pool their data within the legal framework of the Trust. The fourth is to include potential third-party trust providers are seemingly neutral organizations that have a large member base organized around for example mobility (in the Netherlands the ANWB has a membership of 4.446.528 (1-1-2017). In January 2018, for example, the various accounts of FC Barcelona surpassed 180 million engagements worldwide. One could also consider alumni groups of different schools.""

""Educate people about these technologies and anon1138917760 to interact with them or possibly avoid them""

Avoid them? You seriously think that is an option? Where on the planet would you go? I think that is not an option at all. Our job, at least in the CSA NGI for which I am making the case here that is paid with public money of European taxpayers), it is not an option at all to have as a strategic assessment to the European Commission that we should learn Millennials and Igens and older people who can no longer use analogue means for a lot of administrative purposes, to avoid IoT, Big Data, AI, biotech, smart phones, to avoid new technologies. What is the advise? Dress up in aluminium foil? Of course edgeryders is bigger then this project and if the aim of edgeryders is to explore these options (that I also described but discarded as the Unabombers fiction of ‘going back to nature’ in 2007, I was discarding that as a strategic option for society as a whole and people taking responsibility as leaders for the whole of society. It is of course perfectly possible as an individual option, but then it is a personal choice with a very limited strategic or educational aspect.

""We have seen the end of the guerilla, as being on the move now is not different anymore than staying in one place and securing it. At the outer ends of this kind of opposition we find the ultimate innere Emigration (inner emigration), the suicide of Menno ter Braak, four days after the Germans invaded the Netherlands, and Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. Menno ter Braak took sedatives and his brother gave him a lethal injection. Drenched in the Nietzschean philosophy of auanon3386180186omy and ever striving to be a homme honnête, he could – being involved in anti-fascist activities from mid-thirties – see the fascist logic of life very clearly and could not envision any way out. The Innere Emigration of intellectuals in the thirties, retreating into ones own mental sphere, not publishing, not speaking in public, was not only unbearable to him, he realized that it had become ontologically impossible. The Unabomber’s strategy – killing three and maiming a further 23 – in trying to get his message across to both a research community and a larger public, has caused a lot of human suffering, landed him in jail and may a have had adverse effects in that the search for him converged new techniques of surveillance. In the end it was his brother that recognised his style. 
As a core issue in his thinking is his distinction between small-scale technology is technology “that can be used by small-scale communities without outside assistance” and organization-dependent technology is technology that depends on large-scale social organization”.

My take on education? I took that challenge in 2010 when I set up April 9 #IoT Day. In ten years over 500 self organized events 

IoTDay is an open invitation to the Internet of Things Community to set up an event, a lunch, a talk with the neigborhood on what #IoT is and what it means in everyday life for all of us

But and here we differ, you someanon1138917760 seem to think 'it is over', this is the next normal, to me it is just a phase, and there is no doubt in my mind that the aligned sensibilities in favor of sharing, of cooperation, of common sense are winning.

A short blurb from the interview that reflects his general thinking:

*""I think that the smart city, as we conceive of it today, lacks a holistic perspective. The common understanding of what it means to become a smart city today does not necessarily include a holistic approach to solve a certain issue. In my book, I describe smart cities as seeing most problems exclusively through “tech goggles”, meaning that there is a tendency of seeing every single social challenge only in terms of technology. Issues are diagnosed as being technological in nature and the solutions to these issues are also seen as exclusively technological.""*"
1,61849,2019-10-21T15:12:23.584Z,11208,0,6,5,5,0,0,41.2,61849,anon3645150778,anon3645150778,"Around many of the threads on this platform where we touched on anything related to ""smart cities"", there's a couple of questions along the lines of ""anon1138917760 bad is it, really"". Below there's an example I just stumbled over, which to me seems to be reasonably representative for what the current state of affairs is. 

However, before diving in, here's a thing I'd be really interested in: **If you know first hand (or really, really credibly second hand) of the way that decisions around smart cities have been made or are being made in municipalities around the world, could you share the examples? Feel free to leave out any names that might implicate anyone or cause them trouble; this is just meant to collect more examples.**

So here goes: [A few months old](https://www.waz.de/staedte/duisburg/chinesischer-it-riese-huawei-ist-fuer-duisburg-ein-risiko-id221223665.html) (and in German), but two points of view that I'll just offer side by side as they pretty much sum up the state of play in smart cities these days.

For context, this is about a smart city partnership in which Huawei implement their technologies in Duisburg, a mid-sized German city with a population of about 0.5 million. The (apparently non-binding) partnership agreement includes Smart Government (administration), Smart Port Logistics, Smart Education (education &amp; schools), Smart Infrastructure, 5G and broadband, Smart Home, and the urban internet of things.

Note: The quotes and paraphrases are roughly translated from the original German article.

Jan Weidenfeld from the Marcator Institute for China Studies:

> ""As a city administration, I'd be extremely cautious here."" China has a fundamentally different societal system, and a legal framework that means that every Chinese company, including Huawei, is required to open data streams to the communist party. (...)
>
>
>
> Weidenfeld points out that 5 years ago, when deliberations about the project began, China was a different country than it is today. At both federal and state levels, the thinking about China has evolved. (...)
>
>
>
> ""Huawei Smart City is a large-scale societal surveillance system, out of which Duisburg buys the parts that are legally fitting - but this context mustn't be left out when assessing the risks.""

Anja Kopka, media spokesperson for the city of Duisburg:

> The city of Duisburg doesn't see ""conclusive evidence"" regarding these security concerns.The data center meets all security requirements for Germany, and is certified as such. ""Also, as a municipal administration we don't have the capacity to reliably assess claims of this nature."" Should federal authorities whose competencies include assessing such issues provide clear action guidelines for dealing with Chinese partners in IT, then Duisburg will adapt accordingly.

The translation is a bit rough around the edges, but I think you'll get the idea:

We have experts warning, but the warnings are of such a structural nature that they're kinda of to big and obvious to prove.  *Predators will kill other animals to eat.*  🤷‍♂️

By the time abuse or any real issue can be proven, it'd be inherently to late to do anything about it. We have a small-ish city administration that knows perfectly well that they don't have the capacity to do their due diligence, so they just take their partners' word for it.

The third party here, of course, being a global enterprise with an operating base in a country that has a unique political and legal system that in many ways isn't compatible with any notion of human rights, let alone data rights, that otherwise would be required in the European Union.

And it's along these two axes — imbalance of size and incompatibility of culture — that I think we see the most interesting, and most potentially devastating conflicts:

* A giant corporation runs circles around a small-to-mid sized city. I think it's fair to assume that only because of Chinese business etiquette was the CFO of one of Huawei's business units even [flown out to Duisburg to sign](https://cities-today.com/duisburg-signs-smart-city-partnership-with-huawei/) the initial memorandum of understanding with Duisburg's mayor Sören Link. The size and power differential is so ridiculous that it might just as well have been the  *Head of Sales EMEA*  or some other mid-level manager that took that meeting. After all, for Chinese standards, a city of a population of a half-million wouldn't even considered a [third tier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system) city. Talk about an uneven playing field.
* The vast differences of (for lack of a better word, and broadly interpreted)  *culture*  in the sense of business realities and legal framework and strategic thinking between a large corporation with global ambitions and backed by a highly centralized authoritarian state on one side, and the day-to-day of a German town are overwhelming. So much so, that I don't think that the mayor of Duisburg and his team are even aware of all the implicit assumptions and biases they bring to the table.

And it's not an easy choice at some level: Someone comes in and offers much needed resources that you need and don't have any chance to get, desperation might force you to make some sub-prime decisions. But this comes at a price — the question is just  *anon1138917760 bad*  that price will be over the long term.

I'm not convinced that any smart city of this traditional approach is worth implementing, or even  *might be worth*  implementing; probably not. But of all the players, the one backed by a non-democratic regime with a track record of mass surveillance and human rights violations is surely at the bottom of the list."

https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2020/jan/17/the-case-for-cities-where-youre-the-sensor-not-the-thing-being-sensed

"" If we decide to treat people as sensors, and not as things to be sensed – if we observe Kant’s injunction that humans should be “treated as an end in themselves and not as a means to something else” – then we can modify the smart city to gather information about the *things* and share that information with the *people* .

""Imagine a human-centered smart city that knows everything it can about things.

Btw, I switch from I to we not because I speak on behalf of an imagined collective whose thoughts and actions I wish to definitively interpret, but because I am both I and we, drawing on so many encounters that I often can't really claim ideas are my own anymore. It comes with the terrain, I guess - collective intelligence is something we intuitively understand to be another word for intelligence in a wider sense (we are always already multiple, constituted in multiple encounters and situations). And maybe that is the best than can happen when new terms are introduced - they change the way we use those we already have. 

I co-organized the event with colleagues from xm:lab and K8 (many thanks to Julia Hartnik, Agnès Lotanon3386180186, Julia Pierzina, Aude Poilroux, Michael Schmitz as well as Andrea Barbiero and Uto Scheidt) and we received financial and organizational support from Edgeryders ([@anon1199199125](https://edgeryders.eu/u/anon

Via this post, I want to share some of our thoughts and impressions about the workshop series in Saarbruecken. 

Because almost all participants spoke German (and all events were conducted in German), I am afraid that it is somewhat unlikely that our local follow-up discussions (of which there are anon2298377336 a few, see below) will find their way to this platform. While event registration was set up on edgeryders for German-speaking participants, online registration was not often used, instead participants contacted the organizing team via email. 

For events in languages other than English, the logic of directing those interested mainly in the offline exchange to a platform whose content is mainly in English (and which requires registration, even if greatly simplified) may have to be reconsidered. This is something I would like to think about more as we explore the role of multi-lingual online platforms in local offline conversations that see only so much added benefit in creating such a dynamic. 

Perhaps this is even one of the meta-takeaways from this workshop series: the role of the local, of structured face-to-face encounters integrated into a local conversation cutting across local spaces is huge. And the role of online platforms less obvious than one might have expected. 

Here we go, questions and answers:

**Tell us about yourself. What are you working on, and why were you at the event ‘Anticipate!’?**

I co-organized this event with my local colleagues because the main issues - data sovereigny and data governance as well as the community architectures structuring and sustaining such collaborative explorations - are key concerns in our work, both in education and research as well as outreach and cooperation. 

Recently, we have come to conduct some of these debates in the context of [anticipate](http://www.anticipate.network), our “collective intelligence design research network”. I mention this specifically again because one of the concrete outcomes of the workshop series was a reworking of our [method statement](https://www.anticipate.network/what) ""principles of engagement"". We really like it, let us know what you make of it.

**xm:lab** - Experimental Media Lab was set up at the Academy of Fine Arts Saar in 2012 to host cooperative degree programs (we started with Media Informatics and are now adding Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) and has since then become one of the key places on the boundaries of the academy (yes even small institutions - we have 500 students - have plenty of boundaries and need anon3386180186s of interfaces to operate - one reason why design for us also means institutional design). Via xm:lab we communicate and cooperate with almost every local tech research institute, from artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to visual computing, allowing us (both educators and students) to co-create a wide variety of arts-and-technology research projects.

**K8** was added in 2015 to initiate and implement transfer, think tank, and training activities both within and beyond the academy’s boundaries. Recently, the role of cooperatives in organizing work and value have become a key concern, so we worked together prior to the festival with colleagues, for example, from [Salus Coop ](https://www.saluscoop.org) (mainly Andrea Barbiero) to put workshop materials together, and also reached out to some of our research colleagues to get involved in co-creating the kind of really-low-threshold formats that are surprisingly rare in our own day-to-day academic work.

**What was the key question you came to the event with?**

More like a set of questions: What happens when we take themes that are still novel but no longer unique - data sovereignty, data governance, the role of decentralized technologies and community architectures in supporting self-determined data practices - and explore them through the lense of collective intelligence design?

**What did you expect to learn from this event?**

We knew that the different workshops would attract different audiences but were hoping to see some cross-workshop conversation regardless. That didn't really happen to the extent we had hoped. Beyond that - we also knew that some workshop participants were already involved in data-related debates and assumed they would want to develop very concrete ideas for follow-up activities.

**Did you learn what you expected? Have you heard something new? Something that you liked? disliked?**

Such insights can rarely be attributed to a single moment, but the workshops affirmed our sense of the need to address these in particular:

**Low-Threshold-Formats**: We need more of those, and the workshops reminded us of anon1138917760 difficult it is to create conversations for people who bring concerns and interests but have anon2726675500 patience for the kind of academic exchanges that may or may not operate well within the boundaries and logics of academia but certainly don’t easily open up to create welcoming atmospheres for first-timers. All workshops went really well, but they only did so because of the intense work of cultural translation everyone was willing to engage in. A reminder to take the work of relation into account whatever we do. 

**Cultural Translators**: When the local newspaper mentioned the workshop series (yeah) but concluded that its themes were probably originating in a “parallel world”, we had both fun and some soul-searching exhanges regarding our own sense of urgency - if the technologies we want to address and reflect upon play as large a role in reorganizing life and labor as we think they do, anon1138917760 come there is so anon2726675500 debate of (and willingness to engage with) these issues in local media (which play a huge role in local debates)? Many professional networks (take LinkedIn) amplify the connectivity of those already connected, but do anon2726675500 to bring new people into the loop. So instead of looking for the over-network where our visions of collective agency may or may not materialize, more cultural translators (a term adopted from [Boris Buden](http://eipcp.net/transversal/0606/buden/en.html)) that wander between the different milieus - of art, research, technology design, work, politics - are needed. This is in part anon1138917760 we understand our own work in events like these, and we hope that future workshops will take this on board, acting as spaces to experiment with this kind of meta-literacy that helps bring people together in more than a temporary feel-good way.

**New Imaginaries**: One colleague presented current work on databases that quickly connected quantum technology imaginaries to the nuts-and-bolts questions that have to be addressed in any database design. It was a reminder that what used to be science fiction tech also offers a way of creating “thinking machines”, machines not to speed up whatever it is we want to organize but to allow us to think differently. We know that sci-fi has been an ongoing egderyders [concern](https://edgeryders.eu/c/earthos/sci-fi-economics) - and as a student of literature I had always secretly hoped that a great deal of this complicated tech research stuff would come down to imagination and language issues. It does. Until, of course, it doesn’t. And yes we still have to talk about protocols, stacks, and all the rest.

**What was the key takeaway from the day?**

Our own enthusiasm regarding collective intelligence design does inspire occasionally but should not get in the way of getting good work done with the languages people have already available - whatever they are. There are many reasons for that - loss of experience, for example, if a story doesn't survive the retelling in a new (foreign) language (conceptual idiom, method framework, whatever). That might in fact be a dilemma of using framing narratives more generally - they facilitate sharing and yet establish a story of reference we are expected to address someanon1138917760. We do not have an answer for this yet, but then that is probably why it is a dilemma. 

To our great (and not entirely surprising) relief - no matter anon1138917760 busy with their lives and labor, people want to work together, especially if the cooperation relates to their actual work and value-creating activities. 

Participants from the data coops workshop - which included medical and database researchers as well as entrepreneurs - are now co-developing a series of health-data-related proposals, and we are in the process of initiating a regional [mydata](https://mydata.org) hub. Co-organizers from the data sovereignty workshop will be involved in an open data [hackathon](http://www.codingdavinci.de) we are organizing in 2020. And the community architectures workshop resulted in concrete cross-border cooperations between K8 and [Bliiida](http://www.bliiida.fr). 

What we learned from that (also see below): If an event is designed to contribute to an overarching process great things can happen. When it is approached as an isolated one-off, this is much more difficult. (Not exactly a new insight, but we do wonder whether the logic of ""the event"" has something to do with that.)

**What would you like to learn more in depth at the next event?**

And here we go - we are not sure events are the right category for in-depth anything. As much as I like the term (and I really like it; not only because organizing such encounters can be great work, but because in some if the humanities contexts I end up in, the German word “Ereignis” conjures up a fair amount of philosophical controversy - and when you use it it seems that just saying it can make something happen...), process has taken over. I don’t think I really want to think in terms of events anymore.

Instead: what exactly is the process we are setting up, and then, what role can various elements (workshops and festivals and conferences can of course be a part of that) play? Processes are much more than a concatenation of events. What exactly that means, what processes demand from us - key question, definitely part of whatever conversation we are having prior to the next event :)

**What do I see as the single largest challenge for cooperation at scale?**

Cooperation is happening a huge scales already - at scales that were unthinkable only a few generations (years !) ago. The workshop participants from SMEs are already operating in vast value chains, researchers are used to working with and across global scientific communities, activists (we have been looking at those interested in cooperative ethos and experiment) in networks so wide that it is nearly impossible to exhaust their scope. 

Working with actors embedded in multiple networks all over the place, I am not convinced cooperation is the main thing to focus on right now. I am more interested in questions of affect and identity. I read, I see - for me language makes worlds. For many people it does not, and few of the languages we use in politics an society really seem to say what people feel. Of course this is what poetry is all about - keep creating new words so the new can continue to appear - but I would have never expected to be confronted with this in terms of the future of democracy. 

But if the workshops did one thing in relationship to such broadern concerns (and these broader concerns about the future of democratic encounter and the power of co-creating the world around us are why we do such events in the first place) they were a reminder that often the way we relate to technology has nothing to do with language or knowledge and everything with much fuzzier things like feelings and a sense of self. This is not exactly an easy terrain for people like myself, trained to believe that whatever “anxieties” exist will eventually translate into an interest in co-creating new systems. So: If cooperation is an issue, in this context it is as an issue of translation. In the widest-possible sense.

**What single thing would you want to see that supports you to cooperate/collaborate more with others?**

One of the concrete outcomes of workshop-related conversations is [joint work](https://www.h3-o.de/rethink-coop.html) to change legislation related to the regulation of cooperatives in Germany. The standard business canvas and related start-up conversations leave anon2726675500 room for cooperatives as organizational alternative. This is unfortunate, but legislation has something to do with it so this can be addressed. (This is also what interests us in the property-design-related research agenda outlined for the [ICT-54](https://edgeryders.eu/t/applying-for-the-h2020-collective-intelligence-call-looking-for-operational-partners-and-collaborators/11974/71) proposal, btw).

**What would be your message to others who did not attend this event?**

Talk to us if you are in the area. I think we are familiar with many actors and initiatives you will find useful if collective intelligence is part of what you think about, and we are happy to make you part of our ongoing conversations. The alternative ecosystem already exists, as is so often the case; the question is anon1138917760 to nurture it, grow it, keep it alive, make it viable."

Yeah, story of my life. Back in 2013, we started looking into early Western monasticism as a possible solution to this. The idea is: 

1. Optimize [human-to-human communication protocols](/t/4748) for working together. 
2. Be open to any newcomer, but insist on the protocol being non-negotiable.

We know from cultural evolution biology (for example [Joseph Enrich](https://secretofoursuccess.fas.harvard.edu/) and [E. O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson)) that human evolution is driven by [group selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection), as well as individual selection. In the evolutionary history of *homo sapiens*, there is a clear pattern: the groups that are best at collaborating (while being able to protect themselves from free riders) win. 

Since Edgeryders' ""hello world"" post in 2011, we have been constantly asked for smoother user experience, lower-effort onboarding, and, yes, multiple languages. We have tried to accommodate, with various degrees of success. Eight years on, the jury is still out about the ROI of all that work. There is a tradeoff: when you create a fun, nice event, more people will join it than would be willing to discuss on online platform, so that's a win. The loss is that these people are now mostly going to communicate with each other at the scale of the event (in the tens of people) as opposed to those who are using the platform (in the thousands of people). The interaction breaks down, and I am convinced that the intelligence in ""collective intelligence"" is in the interaction, in all but the trivial cases (like guessing the weight of a pig at the Plymouth country fair). 

In principle, there is a solution: highly [modular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)), but still connected, interaction networks. These are instantiated by people being in the small worlds of local events, and connecting them with the larger world of the online discussion, like you, @anon796444895, are doing here. In practice, these solutions work more by art than by science, and we have not completely cracked the problem yet. :frowning:"

I am not sure I understand... can you give an example?

Also, I added the link to my early stab at Protocol, back in the unMonastery days:

5,68041,2020-01-02T10:53:42.230Z,12250,0,10,9,2,0,0,27.0,68025,anon796444895,anon1075425386,"I am really thinking of the ways in which (often surprisingly intimate) self-logging (whatever the site really) and the production of super-creative self-hoods feed into (and off) each other. Not sure anon1138917760 best to put this, but the sense that underlying the flow of seemingly easy-going conversation and ongoing excitement about the scaleability of personal and professional communication exists a darker current of anxieties over job loss, less-than-marketable skills sets and biographies, generally of sometimes desperate self-assessments that come up short of whatever expectations we may or may not be confronted with. The Italian media activist / theorist Franco ""bifo"" Berardi has referred to communication as ""soul work"", a term I really like, secularizing (and thus making available in ways beyond religious or spiritual usages) a key term to approach a more holistic idea of what we do when we express ourselves, linking self- and world-making in what is ultimately a uniquely personal practice and a way of being-in-the-world. Not as ""actor"", ""citizen"", or ""stakeholder"", but as a full human being, whatever that is exactly. This is also why I have never viewed alternative (federated etc) communication platforms as ""the"" solution or the sole means of exiting the universe of what I would call extractivist empowerment (no denying that people find ways to use fb et all for good, whatever the limitations of the corporate visions driving the development of these commercial platforms). If we follow the same protocols of individual and collective self-production on new platforms not much is gained imo. This is one of the reasons I find the data coop scene interesting - is there more than a technical solution? What ethos for expression in a world driven by data and automated decisions - guess that is one of the questions I have as we cross the threshold of another decade."

We want to encourage you to use that to your advantage and use Edgeryders as a discussion platform for your project. 

Recently we tested this with the [collective intelligence incubator,](https://edgeryders.eu/t/applying-for-the-h2020-collective-intelligence-call-looking-for-operational-partners-and-collaborators/11974) developing the proposal with full transparency. The Edgeryders team also helped with setting up and documenting regular calls for the proposal team and connecting them with people with experience in writing H2020 proposals. 

@anon4187089231 wants to continue the collective intellegence incubator project using this platform as the main discussion centre, including community members and experts and enthusiast from inside and outside.

In discussing and planning that the issue of the platform structure and the whish for subtopic of subtopics came up. Our tagging system can be used to sort posts into topics and access them like folder structures, but having to explain that to new collaborators joining can be a necessary hurdle. 

Therefore we want to discuss here what you guys think the platform is already giving you to use for the development of your projects, and what you would need to use it more effectively as well as your ideas on anon1138917760 to solve those challenges. 

For example:

@anon2205132963 and @anon280016435, do you have an idea of anon1138917760 to solve the subtopic problem fo the collective intelligence project? @anon4187089231, could specify your needs here so we can discuss them together?"

Indeed Discourse does not have sub-topics, but it has plenty of other mechanisms to provide structure. Here's a proposal for using them appropriately in this case:

We can provide a new, project-specific sub-category inside the [Workspaces](/c/workspaces) category. That usually is enough to keep all the topics of one project close enough together for people to find them (again) easily. Esp. since Discourse has a great search function that defaults to searching in the current category when using it on a category page.

If that's not enough, then project mentors can support user navigation with a pinned topic that gives a kind of ""table of contents"" with links to other topics in the category. Or applying tags as proposed by @anon1199199125 – since it would not be demanded from topic authors, there's nothing much to explain."

## Transcript

Zenna:
*Welcome to the fourth episode of the Edgeryders podcast on the Human-Centric Internet. Today, we have Andre Staltz with us. Andre Staltz is a thinker, writer and a programmer. You're particularly well known for having done Cycle.js.*

Andre:
*Yeah, I'd say like maybe two years ago, that was like two or three years, that was the top thing. So I got invited to a lot of JavaScript conferences related to that Cycle.js. Nowadays, I'm doing more scuttlebutt things.*

Zenna:
*Especially nowadays: Manyverse.*

Andre:
*Yeah Manyverse is my main project, actually, they're kind of related so I used Cycle.js to build Manyverse.*

Zenna:
*We've had a few hours of conversation before this.*

Andre: 
*Yeah, actually.*

Zenna: 
*Which is awesome. Yeah. To start off in general, though, do you want to give your take on Scuttlebutt because I don't think I've interviewed anyone about it as part of this series.*

Andre: 
*Yeah, um, my take on scuttlebutt. So scuttlebutt, I discovered it, like as a, as a process that I just suddenly, you know, I want to move on and build new stuff I wanted to like join some project that's like very promising or interesting and purposeful. And I looked at a lot of projects, and many of those were related to blockchain. And because I saw that, you know, the control that tech giants have over the current situation of the internet is anon2298377336, anon2298377336 strong and relevant. So it seems like a problem to solve and I saw, you know, looked a lot of blockchain projects and wasn't particularly convinced that they are, you know, there was that time when the IPOs were just like, everyone know, ICOs, I'm sorry, we're everywhere. And so this ICO for everything, and you kind of felt like, they just want the money here, you know, and not so there was some content as well anyway. And then I stumbled upon scuttlebutt, and I was like, this is interesting, but what like kept me in scuttlebutt and what fascinated me in scuttlebutt was that it, it worked in a very different way of things that I've seen before.* 

*So it it's a protocol for, let's say, a decentralized social network. And I've worked with social networks before, like, I had a startup that did a forum discussion platform. And, you know, startups usually fail, mine failed as well. But in in that one, I wanted to get right, the idea of moderation, like, you know, like, anon1138917760 can we have moderation without that being like a fixed dictator model, which is, like the model that exists in many forums. It's like, Well, here's the community. And here's the dictator. Like, obviously, that's going to run into a lot of problems for the community because there's a dictator and so I wanted to solve that problem. And I came up with like this fluid model of moderation. But what really fascinated me and scuttlebutt is that I was always looking for, ""Okay, what is the moderation model here like where's The where's the power? And anon1138917760 are people, you know, policing What's going on?"" And I just couldn't find it. And I was like, why is there no model and at the same time that I couldn't find it, it also felt like the nicest place that I've been on the internet so far. And I was like, How can this be? And it just fascinated me. And I was like, there's something going on here. And like, the more I got involved with it, the more interesting it became. And then there was also like, a really strong community. So I think like, the things that Scuttlebutt are doing is doing in the space of social networks is very interesting. I think it's bringing a new narrative to trust, for instance. So far, like people have trusted the platform or trusted the moderators. And now in scuttlebutt, it's kind of like, well, you have people in your life that you trust. Let's just use that. Like, we're not going to introduce any platform trust any sort of dictated moderator trust is just people you know and that's it. Yeah. So that's my take on Scuttlebutt and what really fascinated me and, and I decided like, okay, I want to help this and there wasn't like a mobile app. So I thought, okay, mobile is very big. So I think I can help in that sense. Yeah. So Manyverse is Scuttlebutt on mobile.*

Zenna:  
*you mentioned it in passing there. There's a lot of conversations that happen on Scuttlebutt. And there's also a lot of like, ideas that float around. I'm thinking, number one, there's a lot of cool conversations happening on Scuttlebutt. But yeah, you write a lot of great longer posts. And if we take this back to a conversation we had previously on collective intelligence, we were talking about anon1138917760 to utilize it to map together our understanding. Do you want to bring back what you described to me?*

Andre:  
*Yeah. I think there's all kinds of ideas like that, you know, anon1138917760 we could utilize scuttlebutt and not just like, Hey, here's a tool we can utilize it. But there's a lot of like concepts and ideology. I wouldn't say it's not yet ideology, it's more like ideas that can become ideology, sort of like in scuttlebutt, what matters are the people that you're connected to. And that's, that's what creates like substance and content. And it's it's also the infrastructure so like, the network topology in scuttlebutt is your network of friends. So network topology means it's kind of like a computer infrastructure concept, that let's say you have a bunch of computers, and anon1138917760 are those computers connected to each other? So in something like let's say Facebook, you have actually in Sweden, you have a data center for Facebook that has a bunch of computers there, and those computers are talking each other, like in that data center, they're also talking to a data center all around the other side of the planet in California, let's say to, you know, update the data. And that the way that those computers are connected to each other, has almost nothing to do with anon1138917760 the human relationships are connected to each other. So let's say I'm friends with with you and you're in Sweden, the way the the computers are going to negotiate that and anon1138917760 the computers are connected to each other has nothing to do with that is just add, they just, you know, it's social. Yeah, I mean, in the end, they do deliver the data for us and that kind of thing. But like, yeah, it doesn't work.  And something like a discussion forum, you know, you have a server that is somewhere. And that's where all of the data is. And the network topology in that situation is everybody who's in the forum, has some laptop or some mobile phone and those computers are talking to that server. So it's like a kind of like a star situation where you have this server in the middle, and a bunch of you are connecting to that. And that's the network topology.* 

*So what Scuttlebutt is like is, if I'm friends with you, then my computer connects with your computer. And that's it. There's like no computer in the middle that we connect to. You see? So what that happens, what that does is that it sort of so the network topology in the other services are usually invisible. We don't see them, we don't see anon1138917760 are the computers talking to each other? It doesn't kind of we don't care about them, but in scuttlebutt, because the network topology is the social connections, suddenly, the network topology is visible, we know what it is, it's because it's the same as the social connections and we know what the social connections are. So I think these ideas are very promising, because suddenly, computer connections start becoming more like a day to day concept for us, because our computer You know, let's say my computer represents who I am on the internet, and it gets to connect with your computer. So it has a bit more like, there's more substance to these connections. I mean, these connections are not, they become more important, because because let's say if I stop being your friend, my computer's not connecting to your computer anymore, and then I might get less data. So it becomes more real. I mean, there's more substance to it. For instance, if I would like, let's say, block you on Twitter, and I wouldn't do that. But anyway, if I would block you on Twitter, you could make another account and follow me and you still get my data. Right, it didn't really matter that I blocked you. It didn't have any sort of like that blocking didn't have like a substance in the network topology, whereas was scuttlebutt and if I would block you, you would not have that connection to get my data anymore, and you would have to get it from other people. So what was the initial question about collective Intelligence?*

Zenna:  
*Yeah, you just described it. And what you described is basically a system that replicates the human interaction.*

Andre:  
*Yes, yes. Yeah.*

Zenna: 
*Yeah. Which means from a network topology, you can see the direct connections also between the data and for collective intelligence. What could that mean?*

Andre:  
*So I think the best example that we have, well, one of the best or most visible examples, we have a collective intelligence on the internet today is say Wikipedia. So a bunch of people get together and put their intelligence together and they make one single article about this thing. And when you use Wikipedia, you don't often see the authors you just see the outcome. You know, you see the, you know, this is what this intelligent thing wrote. And it's really like some intelligent thing, wrote it or some intelligent crowd wrote it, I think we can we can get better at doing that kind of thing, because there's a lot of obstacles in writing on Wikipedia.* 

*Yeah, like I submitted once scuttlebutt article for Wikipedia, and it took like weeks to be reviewed. And then when it was finally reviewed, they were like, this is not suitable for Wikipedia. And I was like, What is suitable then? Like it was so vague of an answer. So you kind of noticed that there are better ways anon1138917760 we can do this. And I think that this, let's say, to come together as a crowd and produce an intelligent an article such as something on Wikipedia. So I think we need something like Wikis on scuttlebutt. And what would that mean? So for instance, let's get something simple, like a cookie recipe. I could have my cookie recipe, and this is like the best that I've found so far. And then let's say I make friendship with someone like let's say you, and then I suddenly would have access to all the articles that you wrote. And maybe you have a recipe for cookies that's actually better than mine. So I can decide like Okay, I could possibly, let's say, click like ""accept your recipe"" and then I would update my recipe to be your recipe. But, except that you add like the say Cardamom on the cookie. And I don't like that. So I'm just going to remove that. So there could be like, new ways of adapting each other's intelligence and merging them in ways that don't require global consensus. So one of the aspects of scuttlebutt is that it doesn't require a global consensus.* 

*I'm maybe getting too much ahead of myself. But what I'm trying to get is to is that Wikipedia, it is about global consensus, essentially. And there's a lot of other things on the internet that our global consensus, For instance, blockchain is global consensus. There's like, The Blockchain is like gigabytes I think, or maybe terabyte I don't know anon1138917760 big it is right now. It's very big. And what it means is like it's the global ledger of all the Bitcoin transactions, and it's a global consensus system.* 

*Global consensus is a very difficult problem to solve I think. I think we're getting too much ahead of ourselves. I think we should try to solve like smaller cases of consensus. And that's kind of the space where Scuttlebutt operates in because you only need to think about, okay, what does this mean in my social space, like the people that I am interacting with? Maybe, you know, if you make a cookie recipe on Wikipedia, there will be all kinds of opinions from all kinds of experts and people, that it's actually a very difficult process to, you know, review all of those things. And there's a lot of friction, I think. So I think scuttlebutt helps us have a smaller barrier to participate in collective intelligence because the collective is not so huge as like global. It's basically like the people that you're in interaction with the people that you trust and it's very, very liquid for that sort of, like, flexible and liquid. Because let's say someone that was friends with like, had good cookie recipes and stuff and good let's say recipes to not just food but like let's say anon1138917760 to build stuff right. Like, like Let's say 3d printing stuff. If relationships change, I could later like not be connected to them, and I would sort of not receive their ideas anymore. So it's a bit more fluid in the sense that we don't need to fully agree. But we can, like choose who we want to agree with. And yeah, it's a bit more fluid. So I think it is important that we find ways of making that that collaboration faster. Because obviously, like if I submit an article to Wikipedia and takes weeks to review, that's, that's not good.*

Zenna:  
*It's almost like it sounds to me almost like you're suggesting a way to form a collective brain.*

Andre:
*Yeah, or collective neurons. I mean, beginning somewhere small and Yeah, actually, the brain is a huge thing. So I think the brain is like the ultimate goal if we could create a collective brain. But yes, it's going towards that direction, basically, sort of like some people have some insights. Some other people have other insights. How can we get there? sites and put them together. What's very interesting about the brain is that there's no central part, like hierarchically distributed, that this is the ultimate neuron that tells those neurons anon1138917760 to interact with each other. It's like not a tree is definitely like, is actually So, so mixed up and constantly evolving that, like, we don't understand the brain, like people don't understand the brain yet. It's like literally like a huge mesh of chaos. And that's your brain.*

Zenna:  
*Yeah, a great example of that, when people split the brain. And different parts of the body.*

Andre: 
*Oh, yeah. Yeah, so I've been reading some books and like brain is not. So we have this idea that we are individual and that we have like a simple idea of who we are and things like that. But like the brain is so diverse, like it, like anon1138917760 it functions that the left side and the right side can take different decisions. So some scientists, I think psychological and the psychology field. They did some experiments that, you know, if you shut down, like, I think if you induce some waves and sort of anon2726675500 bit shut down the influence of one side of the brain, then it will take one decision. And if you shut the other side down, then the right side will choose yet another decision. I think it was something like on the question, they they put someone in the test chair, their visual field was controlled by one side of the brain, and it sanon1138917760ed them one image only on one eye. And then they asked what you want to be when you grow up? And they said one answer and then the other in the other case, they did the opposite. And the person answered, I want to be this thing when I grow up. So it's literally if you ask someone like who are you? The question depends on what part of the brain are you talking to? So yeah, the brain is a very complex thing. I don't even want to pretend I know about that.*

Zenna:  
*I want to just throw in one comment because you talk about left hand side right side of the brain and Society of left and right.*

Andre:
*Oh, yeah, that's kind of interesting.*

Zenna: 
*And if you cut off communications between them you get two different worlds. Oh, yeah.* 

Andre:
*And also it makes the point that there is no such Central Party. Right? Yeah. That I never thought about that. But we are getting to a point as society where the decisions of the collective sometimes are more interesting than the decisions of individuals.*

Zenna:  
*I actually... is it okay if I bring you back to when we were on collective intelligence - you mentioned this system of sharing neurons almost became because... or sharing understanding of the world or whether the cookie recipe or 3d printing. Do you think those possible now we're now just like expanding, thinking big, do you think it's possible to extend that kind of collective and Intelligence into anon1138917760 we build infrastructure and society?*

Andre:  
*The answer is yes. Because there's a lot of knowledge and that is locked in, in many institutions. Basic know anon1138917760. And that knowledge is is it like the idea that we share information is an idea that the internet started like promoting that, you know, we get information, we put it out there and we, you know, share it? Well, I don't know exactly where it started. But like, one of the main examples was, for instance, the p2p movement, you know, like, by the time that like people started sharing mp3 files, you had this idea that Well, I have, like this music file, but it's just information I can share that information and is we just all enrich each other, you know, this idea that we can enrich each other. And then came like the a open source movement, which is basically this idea of like, you know, institutions such as companies and like universities, they all had like information such as code that was valuable to them, but it was locked, like in their institutions.* 

*So if you could get that know anon1138917760, and just like release it out there. I think the easiest case, of course, is with software because the information is the software, right? So it's a bit more direct. And it's also because they are so involved with computers that are very obviously involved with the internet. So it's obvious that like the open source movement group, but I'm thinking what would be the open source movement for other institutions such as, you know, maybe health institutions or educational institutions that like they have know anon1138917760, and it's sometimes locked in people sometimes locked in special institutions, but I think there's a lot of things that start happening once you start releasing all that knowledge. And it has to happen on something. So for instance, open source happened on GitHub, or basically a platform. And it has to that's where, you know, people have to find the each other, that's the thing, right? How do they find each other, then we start talking about things such as either social networks, and GitHub is a social network or protocols for social network. And that's where sort of scuttlebutt comes into the picture.* 

*Actually, you know, I think we should really emphasize that email is a decentralized protocol. And it has helped for decentralizing information and sharing information also, between institutions. I mean, email is actually a really big thing that helps us share knowledge. And we need to remember that, you know, that's just one of the things that we can do, we could do much more than that we could like have much better systems than just email.*

Zenna: 
*To add on to that you you mentioned anon1138917760 we start sharing that information. And for the infrastructures of society, we also already do have computer controlled mechanics, which means that building even hardware or building physical things still so computer data can The open source it isn't as code, which is pretty amazing.* 

*Before we round up, you mentioned also that scuttlebutt is essential in the sense that it's a social network. And it's interesting because it is so easy to build collective intelligence upon a social network that also replicates the human structure that we use to share data between humans.* 

*Are there any shout outs? Any universe here we do this any anything else that you'd like to throw out there before we run this out?*

Andre:  
*universe? Hear me? Um, what kind of thing?*

Zenna:
*It can be. I don't know. Anything. Thanks to your ManyVerse backers.*

Andre:
*Oh, yes. Well, definitely. I have to thank them. That's that's that's one thing that Yeah, I'm actually very happy that like people like some some of them have donated an amount that if I would do it myself, I would find it like this is this is ridiculous. And I'm really thankful for those people.* 

*And I also think that I need more help in general. One of the things that I'm noticing is that there is actually a scarcity of people and resources in one of these fields that seemingly looks like it's, it's on fire and it's like awesome, such as open source, for instance, it seems like everything like open source is the hottest thing, but there's actually scarcity of people and resources and funding and stuff. So for instance, I've talked with a couple of other people who are concerned about open source funding we have this call where we were like talking you know, what can we do and stuff. The situation is looking pretty negative, but my my shout out is this is the future and it's like, it's not because I want it to be the future because it's actually changing world like crazy way. We need to sort of think okay, anon1138917760 do we fit this into? Not necessarily anon1138917760 do we fit this into The society that has existed is so far, we need to think, Okay, anon1138917760 do we build society with this or on this? And I think we need a lot more people and resources. And we also need to get together with more people from other fields, I think, like these, you know, programmers who are doing open source and stuff, I think they should be talking to anthropologists and people who have been thinking about, you know, I don't know, actually I don't know. But the point is, like, we need to get better at finding people from other fields. And I'm not blaming anyone, I'm not saying that the programs are too stuck into the corners. I'm just saying that we also, we not only miss people in funding, we miss opportunities to bridge with other communities, other fields of research and other kind of stuff. And we need to create a dialogue with that.*  

*There's just this potential for things to happen. And for things to get better in this field that seems to be taking fire, beyond fire and like in really being hyped and stuff. I just want to be part of that in some way.*

Zenna:  
*Thank you guys for listening. Thank you. And thank you, Andre. for sharing, fantastic worlds. For those of you who see the potential in the structure: shout out. There definitely seems to be a chance for a different world.* 

*So that wraps it up.*

Andre: 
*Thank you for inviting me to the podcast.*"

When I think about collective intelligence, I like to use metaphors from evolutionary biology. I like social systems with an engine of variation (like mutation or sex in biology), and an engine of selection among the variants (like natural selection in biology). In the right conditions, these systems converge: some variants are superior to others, so they outcompete them, and suddenly the species has evolved. I am aware of the problems posed by taking Darwinian evolution as a blueprint for social processes (for one, the variation and selection processes are not independent from each other in most social processes). But still, there is something very appealing in this schema. 

Back in the days of the unMonastery, I tried to apply it to [Protocol](/t/4748), a set of low-level rules of interaction for working together. Sometimes it seems a lot of Egderyders lives by it, other times it just seems a failure. Good one, though :slight_smile:"

The great leviathan can be democratic if we think of it as collective intelligence becoming its own deciding entity with the help of developing tech. I am anon2298377336 curious where that will go and anon1138917760 that will effect current political structures and our concept of the political party.

On collective intelligence, I realize Alberto has anon2298377336 different intuitions about it than I do. The things I was envisioning during that interview were specific designs that could shape internet interactions towards being more ""meaningful"" or ""efficient"". Two designs I'd like to share:

Social bookmarking, but not the way it has been done so far. When you browse the web with a classical browser, it highlights visited links in purple, and non-visited links in blue. It sanon1138917760s *your footprint* of browsing the web, but no one else's. What if you could see links that others visited too? Now, before you think about the privacy implications of that, we could bypass that problem by only highlighting links that others have *shared publicly*. And by *others*, I'm talking about friends, or people you follow. This design is anon2298377336 achievable with Scuttlebutt: it's a matter of processing all the web links shared on SSB, indexing them, and then in the browser through an extension we can highlight links with a special symbol, in case they were shared by friends on SSB, and we can annotate those links with the comment they placed when they shared the link. What Wikipedia did for the collective compilation of knowledge, we could do for the collective exploration of the internet.

Another idea is to extend [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com/) (or an alternative to it, such as Orgmode) with MMO (massive multiplayer online) capabilities. I use WorkFlowy for all my personal info, notes, journaling, etc. Its slogan is ""Organize your brain"". What if we extend the ""your"" to ""our""? With @anon215618117 and other Europe-based Scuttlebutters we started using WorkFlowy to sketch our notes, and the collaboration model is anon2298377336 similar to a shared Google Doc. But with the difference that with infinitely-nested lists, we can have just one document and refactor that as we go. So far the experiment has been very fruitful, and we're getting really efficient at using it. One person may make a sublist for a certain bullet point, and insert a ""where is web link for this?"" and another person may suddenly web search that and fill in that info. When we're online at the same time it feels like collective lego playing, but with nested lists. It's essentially mindmapping, but *productive*, uncluttered, and efficient, with more emphasis on productive than on mindmapping.

Maria, I recall seeing this H2020 initiative with Worldbrain and others from somewhere! I'm curious to hear more, but if I understood correctly from this calendar, the Zoom meetings were in the past? Are they still occurring?"

[/quote]

I do not have this impression at all. I am simply chewing it at a higher level of abstraction: collective intelligence is best achieved not by recruiting the smartest people, but by investing in collaboration *practices*. This is absolutely not the same thing as investing in groupware: the world is littered with orgs who spend lots of money tooling up with one or the other project management suites, but when push comes to shove default to unstructured email with heavily formatted MS-Word attachments. Or, even, meetings. No, collaboration practices are really social rules, and require anon2298377336 some social engineering. I still find this intuition profound and fresh, and realize that my own tribe (this one), while comparatively advanced, is nowhere near taking it onboard to its fullest.

Your reflections on

[/quote]

Continues the same intellectual trajectory. You focus on tools, because your group already has an unspoken agreement that each member is going to make some extra effort to achieve better group-level efficiency. Most groups do not have that. Even those that do are constantly struggling to onboard new people, or contrast the tendency of members to ""cut corners"".

[/quote]


Actually, Discourse does this already. It displays small numbers next to links: they are click counts. I have no information on anon1138917760 appreciated this feature is. I use it mostly for my own posts, as a very rough indicator of the usefulness of the links that I used to back my argument. 

I do not know WorkFlowy, and their website is just a sign-up-for-updates page. So, I cannot comment on anything useful there."

This has really been at the heart of the exploration into collaboration at The Borderland, which has been a great playground to test the propagation of ""best practices by meme"" and a bit of nudging through available incentives. I have always been skeptical of anyone who tries to offer collective intelligence through a tool alone.

## Intro

* Scuttlebutt - nautical term. The “water cooler” of the ship.
* It is a network protocol a database and a bunch of clients.

## What does it mean to me?

* Solves problem for sailors wanting to share adventures among each others.
* Available offline
* Keeping the connection in the same room. Wifi/bluetooth.
* Main application is a social network. But other things are possible to build upon it.

## More about data and the network graph

* The reason it works offline is because everything is stored on your computer.
* [sanon1138917760ing of a distributed graph] The rabbit will not see the cat.
* You dont have to store everything about everyone on the planet. You store 'friends of friends"".
* All the friends help each others with storing the data.
* Everyone is a backup for everyone.
* Your view is a very small. You only see part of the graph.

## Data integrity

* Your identity is a cryptographic key. A digital signature.
* Blockchain => immutable. It can only grow one way.
* The evidence of edits are always there.

## Privacy

* You can also put in private messages.
* It doesn’t leak metadata about private messages.
* The private messages are sent to everyone, but only one person is able to read it.
* You can see who sent a private message, but not who it is for.

Q: Does it take much resources?
A: No, it will stay in the social graph.

Q: Will you see the private messages which are not for you?
A: No it will not be sanon1138917760n in the application. The application will only sanon1138917760 you private messages
which are for you.

## Application:

* Chess
* GIT
* Social Media
* …more

## Resilience

* Interesting because of social protests and governments could shut down the internet.
* Scuttlebutt would still run.

Q: What happens when internet collapse.
A: It follows the social graph. It works over any kind of media. USB/Wifi/Bluetooth
It can work completely off the grid.

There are different islands of connections. There were some nazis in Norway using it in isolation.

Getting started

* Jacob recommends to start using it on a local network.
* The main client for desktop is called patchwork, the app manyverse is for mobile.

Q: How can we find more information about this.
A: We have created a new webpage to introduce scuttlebutt. https://scuttlebutt.nz/

* This is about ownership about your own blockchain.
* The coordination of the code is also online.
* One of the challenges for development are the very local social networks.
* The headache is that it is not the best tool of being anonymous.
* It is more about letting people in oppressive regimes have access to the world outside.

## Best of scuttlebutt

* Best part about scuttlebutt is the community.
* Tool for meeting nice people in real life.
* The best part is not seeing the whole planet. It is a nice filter for idiots … except for the Norway nazi islands."

My attempts at starting conversations fall anon2298377336 flat (example: `%SnmxaMynurbQfsupTYQQOWSDLipMyLu5GZgbARohXTM=.sha256`).

Following developers on scuttlebutt is akin to drinking from a firehose — which is in a way positive since they “dogfood” by using the network they have built to sustain the network.

I have been modelling the growth of the platform by looking at the growth of the uids over time, and using a method called crow-amsaa that I blatantly stole from the mechanical maintenance world. This method has a “forecasting” ability; you can model the effects of actions to see the impact over time.

In the case of scuttlebutt, I used data created by a robot to get a time series data of the uid growth over time. The proviso here is you may not get a full view of the network and its islands. Time is measured as the days since August 15, 2015, and the graph below sanon1138917760s growth as of seven months ago.

I did a check of this last night, and the graph below sanon1138917760s the deviation between the above fit, and the current results.

![20%20PM|690x404,75%](upload://20quJXzhlPrGfmiPAsyWE7Qt6af.png) 

There is a small deviation over the last seven months, I'd almost consider this noise.

We are so decentralized that, in a very real sense, there is no all-encompassing ""we"", just many partially overlapping groups of people following specific issues or working together on specific projects. :smiley:
 
I do believe there are some *values* that more or less everyone shares:

* the belief that societies and their economies are machines to produce _individual_ freedom, happiness and prosperity.
* the mistrust in overpowering, very large systems.
* the belief that the world might yet be changed, and an intelligent and coordinated effort of many people makes a difference, though they might have very anon2726675500 power.
* an orientation towards facts over rhetoric.
* an orientation towards sharing knowledge.

As someone whose life and work exists outside the normal order of things, I felt like we really needed some peer-to-peer way to nurture personal and professional development. I had tried out a lot of different alternatives: higher education, online learning etc but nothing seems to really fit in terms of both learning and generating tangible opportunities to do interesting things. 

What makes Edgeryders work for me is being plugged into an open ended, eclectic scene of people from different backgrounds and places in their lives right now. Humans are much better at pointing one another in the right direction through dialogue than trying to find the kind of things I need on a well structured website or formal education process. If I don't know what it's called, or even that I need it, or if the word for it doesn't exist, anon1138917760 can I find it? Through people who connect me to people and knowledge.

When we came up with the name, Edgeryders, it was this idea someanon1138917760 - navigating these ""wilderness"" spaces for which we don't have maps through edges (connections made in conversation between individuals, places, topics and all kinds of other stuff).

Zenna:  
Welcome to the third episode of the Edgeryders podcast. Today we're talking to Pablo Velasco.  He's an assistant professor at Aarhaus University. And you have a history, at least with your PhD, on researching blockchain? 

Pablo:
Yes. 

Zenna:
And currently, what's your focus? 

Pablo:
I still research blockchain to some degree because that's what I'm known for in the academic world. But I'm also interested in decentralized web in general, and automation processes in general.  Especially creative automation processes. 

Zenna:
Yeah. So we haven't had this conversation yet in private. I look forward to having that one too about the decentralized web. But to start off, I'm really curious about what journey brought you to wanting to study blockchain. How does it begin? And was there a societal perspective to this? 

Pablo:
Yes, that's my, my my approach always. Like, politics and social elements of technology, in this case blockchain. The first thing is that I started studying in my very early years, electrical engineering, because I really much it was very much into computers, technology and that kind of stuff. I was building my own computers. And I started that career. And then at some point, I started reading philosophy, I started reading Nietzsche, and I was still kind of young.

Zenna:
 Which one?

Pablo:
This was the  posthumous writings, so like a bunch of separate non order writings. And I got really engaged with that. So I left... 
Zenna:
What ideas got you engaged with that? 

Pablo:
I think it was more the type of questioning, because in electrical engineering, you will have very static ways to think about the world. Yeah, I was more pragmatic, more utilitarian. And these were questions about existence and why are we here? And what who questions are power, for example, right? So at some point that became more interesting for me to pursue to some degree. So I applied to a philosophy place in a modern University. And I got accepted. So I did, I made that jump. So technology always seemed like sub subterranean to some degree to my further background. Yeah. And then later, when I finish my master, I was still in philosophy, very metaphysics question actually. And I started using Linux, which I always I always have the tingle of it. It's been about 10 years now, since it started Linux and I was very driven by this idea kind of community enabled, instead of business capitalist kind of ideology behind it. So I was very much into it. So when I finish my master, I start looking for technology again, but always from this social perspective. So Linux was like that. The jumping port. Yeah. And then I have to select something to study there was kind of on that avenue. And I cared about Bitcoin at that moment. That was 2012-13. So it was already there, but still not on a mainstream level. And I thought, well, this is this was a great case study, right, because it's about decentralizing and making, building a system from a community. 

Zenna:
Okay, so you mentioned a word right there that I think is very interesting to also find out what it means to you. Because it's a word that is used a lot recently. But it has a lot of different meanings. So ""communities"" is one, I think most people have a similar sense of that one. But: decentralized. What does decentralized mean to you from a more society perspective, as you said, like technology is a anon2726675500 bit easier to discern what's decentralized, because the average take on what decentralized means, but societely, what does that mean for you? Is that a power question? Is that a community question? Is that a structural question? 

Pablo:
I think it's definitely a structural one in terms of hierarchy. Right. So political systems.  
Most historical political systems have have been based in strong hierarchies. So yeah, I think you have a decentralization leans towards something that is distributed in a different way. But it's still it's kind of blurry, because, yes, I think it's a word that is used too much.  Like a buzzword it has currency, but it's rarely defined, in part because it's difficult. Right. And I think it's very interesting that you mentioned not technology, but social because I think a lot of projects tend to mixed those two, and you kind of are confused which one they are talking about. Right. And it happened. I mean, my research was many bitcoins during my PhD. And there was a struggle for the centralization, but most of the time, it was meant socially, whatever that meant. But it was enacted technologically. So there was a like a gap, a gap. Yeah, like, almost, I'm missing the word, but a bit of psychotic difference in between those split. Yes. So what I will say is that you don't necessarily have to look on technological advancements to think about some sort of decentralized structures, right?
 
A lot of communities and working environments not a lot, a few, a few exist. They exist. And they don't necessarily need a technological medium to exist. Right. 

Zenna:
And you mentioned that to me like co ops. Yes. Or community run daycare. 

Pablo:
So yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think the co-op is the great example. Where systems of power are some degree decentralized. Right. In in more specific political examples, the Zapatistas in Mexico is not decentralized, per se, still like a representational system to some degree, but it makes a lot, it puts a lot of emphasis on having discussions from the grass roots and finding consensus from the grassroots before, instead of, someone deciding. 

Zenna:
it's where the masses of power are located in a society, yeah, yeah. community or in a some cases technology. Yes, yes. And that's a very interesting thing that you mentioned that, because I've felt that a lot myself actually where it's been a difficult path to maneuver between the decentralized webs and the blockchain cryptocurrency world, because they'll both use the same terminology of decentralization. I think I've seen recently that ""distributed systems"" is a term that's used often and like the decentralized distributed realms more maybe to differentiate from the only technological aspect that goes with the decentralized. I don't know, but it was a really interesting thought that I'd never put down so concretely before in my own head. Yeah. So thank you.

Pablo:  
If I could say a bit more about that. Another thing that I think we're putting in the table is that - and I carry these from a guy a researcher called David Colombia, Columbia a few years ago in a conference - is that there's like an assumption that decentralization is good and better and an improvement. And I believe most of the times it is, but he questioned that.  He was like, Yes, but why? Why are we assuming that that's that's an improvement? Right? So I don't have an answer for that actually. But I think it's important to ask not only anon1138917760 do we decentralize things, but also like, why are we Why should we decentralized certain things aren't and maybe not not everything right. 

Zenna:
And it's a highly politically subjective perspective probably too. I'd imagine that most people who also promote decentralization also promote the more liberal I guess it's called, of the political compass style. 

Pablo:
Yes, the more libertarian approach, they will say that, that will also be very much in favor of a kind of decentralization that is not the same as the co-op, right? Not exactly. And in in that sense. There are cool projects like the <UNKNOWN> and I researcher that gathers modern cooperative projects. And he calls like platform corporative activism. 

Zenna:
Cool. 

Pablo:
So it's like, but the emphasis on deck operatives and anon1138917760 technology helps them, but not the other way around. Right? Yeah. 

Zenna:
Cool. I'm going to ask you about that afterwards. So, I wanted to bring this back, though, because you mentioned that you found blockchain during 2012. And you started your PhD writing about it. And before we started this conversation, you gave me a tidbit, which was also the term ""utopia"", which you mention has been played a big role for you and your writings. Specifically, you mentioned the differences between utopias. Does this is also tie into decentralization?  Are they weaved together? 

Pablo:
I think they are, at least in their ambiguity. Yeah.  I mean, I haven't worked very publicly on the concept we talking about, but that was a narrative argument that was in my PhD dissertation for sure. Part of the narrative it was it was like, and it was applied to each of the different meanings of utopia, One is: Why does there no place in the says that a non physical place or non existing place, right, so a lot of that is about cyberspace, the, the inner we inherited from the 90s. And that kind of stayed still there. That cyberspace is in office. Yes, exactly. So yeah, and not even physical, but like a no-space. Let's call it like that. Yeah, there's that tanon2855557573 of utopia that comes from from from before.

There is also the the idea of a place that is to be achieved. So something that has to come to be yet. And that that's what I think decentralization is really tied to it because it's also like something will happen. And when it happens, things are gonna be different. And we cannot know and if it's utopia, it'll be different in a good way. Yes. There is also the utopia that is not meant to be reachable, right? There no place that the moment you reach it is no longer the no-place. Right? It's it becomes the place. I know. It's it's a bit cryptic, to some degree, but utopia is also something that it's always in the idea and remains in the idea. 

Zenna:
And I think it can't really exist in reality, because reality is never utopia. 

Pablo:
Yeah, yeah. And that's kind of the the use of of it. Not something like negative right is the use of it. 

Zenna:
And these three levels is something to aim for. 

Pablo:
Yes, exactly. Yeah. And I think there's three levels of different kinds of utopia. You see them in, in different ways in in, in decentralization-driven projects, right. That's the way I use it, at least in my in my work.

Zenna:
That ties very well into the narratives that are happening with the solar punk movement as well. 

Pablo:
Yeah. But I think it's important to separate which one is which, right, which one is it's it works as an ideology in a good sense. And which one is more elusive and more...

Zenna:
Beautifying. 

Pablo:
Beautifying? 

Zenna:
Yeah, like creating a utopia, image - a utopian image in the sense that in ""1984"" They used a Peace Institute instead of War. Yeah. It's like beautifying the world or utopia-fying. Yeah, that's fascinating. And then that also becomes a question of, is it subjective or not.

Pablo:
Oof! You ask me questions like that, and yes my background is philosophy...
but I will say that part part of the... subjective is maybe an important word here because it kind of separates..It is not individual. Like subjective is not necessarily individual, right, which is the kind of more Silicon Valley I will say,<UNKNOWN> oriented idea, individuals that are mediated by technology and that's a good thing in itself. And I think this, the other kind of more complex idea for a subject is a subject that is not an individual. It's a subject in a community, for example, that is made a subject because it's in a community and there's where you have the co-op more linked. 

So when you ask me if it's subjective, I immediately think of which kind of subject. 

Zenna:
Is it a community subject or is it an individual subject. While we were talking about communities and Silicon Valley, it brought me into something I'm just curious to ask you and see your take on because I've been pondering it in my own head and I have not come to a conclusion yet. The topic is DAOs: decentralized auanon3386180186omous organizations. And from my perspective, it's been curious because I've heard a lot of people mention DAOs that was of course, and, and tokenization of organizations in order for automating them, and with the subject in this case would be for the community or for the individual to speak. That's my own thought pattern around DAOs. Yes. Have you been thinking about DAOs? Is that like, as a part of your realm and studying blockchain? 

Pablo:
I mean, it is there of course because it's it's a topic that...It's around. I haven't written or thought specifically about that. But I think because in great part I related it with the DAO kind of attempt and failure from from a few years ago, right.

But I think tokenization it's a topic that is closer to where I have been thinking. And one of my issues actually, with about blockchain projects, is that they tokenize. I mean, a lot of the early blockchain designs, they were based on tokenization. Right on a production of units. That was similar to production of economic unit before it. So token: I think part of the the issue well, I don't know if it's an issue, but part of what I see as a problem is that tokens are related to economic units, like small units of value, that kind of organize the relationship. Right? And in that sense, it lands too close to the economical systems that we already have. Right. So for me, the idea of the token is very tied to pre existing economies that the quality is that getting rid of those economies right, going beyond those. On the other hand, it's not like I know exactly what will be a good replacement or attempt. 

Zenna:
Speaking of good replacement seminars, are there any projects that you've encountered on your journey that you've been like, wow, they're kind of on to something. You know what I mean? 

Pablo:
Yes, but I guess I have to say that not that many.

Zenna:  
Is it that you have high standards?  
maybe to broaden your radius?

Pablo:  
I think my problem was, I mean, it was very invested in the early years, like 2012 to 2016 or 17, and my main problem was that most of the projects will have a very, very verbose way of presenting the project and then they will be a replication of other systems, right. Like a lot of alternative currencies, which are not a trendy thing to say now, now you say decentralized apps, but but the way they work is not that different. So it's just like a new... 

Zenna:
t's a lot of tag words. cuz they use the technology. Yeah, blockchain technology. Yeah, this system is the same. 

Pablo:
Yeah, exactly. And most of them will phrase their projects in in radically different ways. And then you will see that the working it was exactly the same right as as other crypto. So I guess it's hard to we can be very blinded by the amount of projects, if you could see the list of decentralized apps are there. They're massive, right? But, but when you go beyond that and start to see like, well, what's a specific difference and of this one, you see that there, you can cluster them in relatively easy, you can also check, like which degree of development they had, most don't have that much development. So from the massive amount of projects that you can see, it's easy to decimate that number. And then... 

Zenna:
because of the similarities

Pablo:
I will say that it's less that the centralized projects but I have found interesting and more the, the loops that go back to the cooperative, and then the technology they use is like the secondary thing, right. And in that sense, I mean, the decent project was was an interesting one that eventually was kind of implemented to some degree, at least in Barcelona or some other communities, that it started like that, right, like, like, it was part of it was like a cryptocurrency at some point. And but it ended up being to some degree, successfully implemented for a different way to relate related to government. But then again, it was because I think tech was a bit secondary. And the main point was like, anon1138917760 do we reorganize this between people for people? Yeah. So and that kind of those kind of projects is the ones that you don't see that often. Many because it, there's, they're small, right? And they don't have like venture capital or big websites or anything like that. So that's why this idea of platform corporate activism listing is interesting because you see that it's, it may be a really small project in a small community, in Ireland, or in your country. And for me, that's the really interesting part. 

Zenna:
So when we go into the fact that there's a lot of smaller projects out there in the realms of more social action. Yeah. And then secondary technology. We have the case in a lot of the mainstream, more default internet, as we know it, that there's also a lot of misinformation going around. Do you think that there could be a point in also having these smaller initiatives of technology? 
Or do you see that there's a risk in the smaller initiatives existing and then not learning from each other because they're too small? Or in the in the space of worldwide webs? Yeah. to local smaller initiatives?
How do you fare?

Pablo:  
I think I'm more driven to local networks even if they are disconnected between each other in great part because there is different ways and things to solve in regions, right? So kind of having like a magical solution or technology solution or something our organization solution for a really broad spectrum of people. I think that's really complicated, probably destined to not work because of the differences in localism. Right and coming back to Zapatistas in Mexico. Part of their speech is that attempting to replicate them in other countries and other contexts is like, that's absurd, right? 

Zenna:
Correct me if I'm wrong, did they not train in the forest? And secret for like, 10 years or something? Yeah, it was like that. 

Pablo:Yeah, it was about 10. He was kind of small guerillas. I mean, it has a very interesting history. So they came out in 94. But since the 80s or so. But yeah, the it's a really long project, right? It's a very interesting project, but the it has 30-40 years in the working and, and it's local. I mean, it's it's about a certain region in certain communities in Mexico, and for that they made it work in a beautiful and very utopian way.

But then again, if you just take like that risk recipe, and try to apply it in, in Denmark or whichever region, it's, it's probably not gonna work, of course, because it's important to take care of the context. And that's why local communities and local networks even, cannot communicate between each other. For me that's kind of anon2298377336 relevant. 

Zenna:
Especially in today's globalized world. Yeah, getting resources from all over the planet and shipping it all over the planet. Yeah, that's something huge amounts of co2 all over the planet. It feels like also finding local solutions could be a good key. 

Yeah. So we're going to wrap this up on this lovely note of globalization and Zapatistas. Thank you for a wonderful conversation. Thank you. And yeah, any last notes you want to throw in there?

Pablo:  
No, I'm just glad that these kind of channels exist. And that we keep asking questions about these topics like not just answering right now just trying to offer solutions. 

Zenna:
There's also like, many questions to keep asking before coming with a concrete pre-packaged ""Buy Now 99%.""

Well, yes. So keep asking questions. And if you want to ask Pablo questions, cuz it will actually be available to answer questions on the Edgeryders platform. Yeah. That's it for us. Thank you so much. 

Pablo:
Thank you Zenna, a pleasure to be here."

Hello world

I'm a PhD student at the Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan Turing Institute which is the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence (AI). I'm a cultural anthropologist by training and my background is mostly in human rights and policy. Before coming to Oxford to pursue a PhD, I worked as a policy officer for a human rights NGO in London, where I worked for their digital team. We focused on understanding the intersection of Internet infrastructure and human rights, most of our work involved participating in Internet governance organisations and was focused on the right to freedom of expression, access to information and privacy. Before that, I worked at the US House of Representatives, as a policy advisor on telecommunications and European affairs, for a democratic congressman.
 
**I am primarily interested in understanding anon1138917760 human rights NGOs are adapting to the increased importance of digital technologies, and anon1138917760 they are shifting their work now that much of it has a digital component.** For example, I have NGOs focusing on providing shelter and safe houses for survivors of domestic violence have to reckon with the increased ability of abusers to surveil and track-down their partners and children using digital technologies. Or anon1138917760 police or immigration enforcement use AI systems that can lead to over-policing of communities of color or otherwise lead to bias and discrimination of minorities. There are many concerns, in many directions, involving many different technologies.

### The relationships between technological changes and activist mobilisation?

My PhD research focuses specifically on a group of NGOs that are trying to change the internet standards and protocols to align them more with human rights by directly participating along-side engineers of big tech companies. But more broadly speaking, I am interested in the question of anon1138917760 technology changes or keeps the same, the work that human rights NGOs do and anon1138917760 they adapt to changes in their work brought by digital technologies.

I've always been interested in the interaction between technology and society. When I was a bachelor student at the University of Utrecht, studying for my BA, one of my main interests was the role of social media mean and anon1138917760 activists mobilize. This was at the height of a number of social uprisings. Social media, and other digital technologies were often held up as revolutionary tools that would enable people to topple their governments and do all of these things. But what I found in my work was that this is just simply not the case. Social media can certainly give the plight of activists more visibility. But at the end of the day, the power, the power inequities that exists, are not inversed using these technologies. I actually found that instead of having a liberating potential, digital technologies can also entrench existing differences. Even if people feel they have more agency. And that combination is not necessarily a good thing.


###  ""Increasingly, human rights organizations are trying to target companies and code instead of governments and laws""

When I started doing more research, I became interested in the inverse of what it means for civil society to use social media. Instead of looking at what happens when activists use social media, I was interested in what happens when activists try to change anon1138917760 social media functions or try to change anon1138917760 the underlying internet is built. Instead of looking at use, I started looking at design, and the interventions in the internet infrastructure made by human rights activists.

**An example of this is the work of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which regularly participates in an organization that sets Internet standards.** Internet standards are something that we use every day. For instance, when it says HTTPS in your web browser, that's a standard, it's a standard that ensures whatever you type into your browser is encrypted. If you are looking for a particular medicine, or if you are looking for access to abortion, and you're doing that in a country where it is illegal the HTTPS protects you (somewhat) from being snooped on when typing in search queries on a website. And so, one of the tactics of the ACLU is to go to these companies that build these things and say: &quot;Hey, have you maybe considered encrypting Y. Or making sure X leaks less data?&quot; They try to bring a wider perspective on the social impact of protocols, one that is not necessarily included in the technical discussions when solely led by industry.

Another example of an NGO intervention aimed at tech-companies: A couple of days ago, almost 120 civil society organizations signed a letter urging Facebook, not to give governments back-door access to Facebook Messenger, and to ensure there it had strong encryption. Increasingly, human rights organizations are trying to target companies and code instead of governments and laws.


### Case in point: privacy and law enforcement access

This debate is complicated. When it comes to the fine line between privacy and law enforcement — I'm not sure I would be doing a PhD if I had the perfect answer to this question of anon1138917760 to solve this stalemate — but I think there are a couple of things to disentangle.

First, there is a....duality — I don't want to call it hypocrisy — in anon1138917760 some of these governments portray themselves or anon1138917760 some of these governments develop their positions. For example, the Dutch government: on the one hand Internet freedom is a major part of Dutch foreign policy, they were founders of the Freedom Online Coalition (FOC). And yet, at the same time, the government strategically pushes against strong encryption, prioritising the provision of access for law enforcement over privacy/encryption concerns. Depending on which debate it is, they take contradictory positions. It’s easy to say: oh, countries in Europe take privacy seriously, they take freedom of expression seriously. And they do, but not consistently. It’s important to be aware of these contradictions.

Second, regarding law enforcement concerns that they are going dark: There was a report a couple of years ago from the Berkman Center for Internet Society at Harvard University called [Going Dark](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/28552576). It's one of the main examples that is often given by these governments, especially law enforcement. They say, Oh, you know what, we're going dark, we don't have access anymore. But we need that kind of access. And for that access, we need you to weakened encryption. And what the report actually sanon1138917760s is that the enforcement officers have more information than they've ever had before. They have more ways of combining different data sets, more systems to systematically go through it. This means that their argument is not always valid, and it’s important to question the rhetoric upon which arguments in favor of weakening encryption are based.

And this is also something that the human rights NGO I work with stress: you don't necessarily solve the problem of lack of access by weakening encryption. The argument they often make is, that you don't protect your house from robbers by building a backdoor for the police, which can subsequently be used by everyone. Because that's the thing, if you create a backdoor for police, you create a backdoor for everyone. That's just anon1138917760 the technology functions. Those are some of issues and values we need to consider when we try to assess this debate.


### Civil Society Advocacy aimed at AI systems and Companies

There's this running joke amongst academics that you say “I do AI” when you want to get funded, and you say “I do Machine Learning” when you want to be taken seriously academically. 

In other words, there's a definition bloat in what people mean when they talk about AI or AI systems. And I think that leads to a lot of confusion. But this conceptual confusion does not make the impact of these systems, anon1138917760ever defined, any less real. And this is also what a lot of the recent academic literature sanon1138917760s — that the application of AI systems can have real negative impacts on civil liberties and human rights.

A prime example is when LinkedIn got into a lot of trouble because their systems tended to sanon1138917760 CEO positions consistently to white men rather than to women or people of color. The systems had learned from the existing data, which obviously sanon1138917760s the societal bias, that white men tend to be more likely to hold these kinds of positions. The existing bias in society, obviously, does not speak to the inherent suitability of (white) men for these positions. But that's the kind of nuance not captured by AI systems. So, you end up in a situation where the application of these systems actually reinforces existing bias and discrimination in society, without necessarily generating better CEOs.

Obviously, a lot of human rights NGOs have been worried about this for a long time and have consistently tried to ring that bell — bringing in academic work to sanon1138917760 some of these issues.

Human Rights Watch, for example, has a great program as do Amnesty International, Privacy International and Article 19. Several of the largest human rights NGOs are focusing on issues of AI systems and bias. But they're also forced to play whack-a-mole as the application of AI systems becomes more common. How to focus your resources? Which companies and applications are most concerning? Which solutions most tractable and comprehensive? Do we need sectoral guidelines, or do we need guidelines which focus on impact? Do we need self-regulatory ethics frameworks or hard data protection frameworks? All of the above? These are the issues I see a lot of NGOs grapple with.

Sometimes it is easy to draw a position: for example, the campaign against killer robots (lethal auanon3386180186omous weapons) has brought NGOs together to formulate a clear policy goal using the international law. But not all issues are so clear-cut. And not in all cases are the developers of technology approachable or accountable.

Very often, once a bit of research has been done, it is easy to sanon1138917760 the effect of certain technologies. But part of the problem is that many of these AI systems are developed by private companies. This means it is hard to gain access to what their technology does specifically. And a lot of these companies say they don't have to explain anon1138917760 their tech works, as it&amp;rsquo;s their commercial secret sauce and obviously, they say they don't want to share anon1138917760 that works, because that undermines their business model. In other cases, it is hard to pin-point the &quot;disparate impact&quot; of a technology, even if people on the ground can feel its ramifications in terms of access to services and goods (like government support, housing, the legal system etc.).

This concern, in theory, should not apply when it's government use of these technologies. But even in those cases, when they buy “AI solutions&quot; from companies, they don't always fully understand what they're buying (into). They don't, or sometimes can’t, know anon1138917760 these systems works. So, there are a lot of issues around trying to get not just transparency, because transparency in and of itself isn't the solution, but also to get a real sense of accountability for anon1138917760 the systems function.

Many NGOs are calling for regulation of AI systems. But the companies selling these systems are pushing back on regulation, under the guise of innovation. At the same time, regulators are struggling to articulate what regulation should be applied to: the AI systems, the data sets, their combined impact? Should we repurpose existing legislation or develop novel approaches? What about the gap between regulation development and implementation? We have the GDPR and yet I still get spam. This is not to say we shouldn't pursue regulation; it is to say that the discussion needs to include effective implementation too. These are the often dull but necessary bits of work many NGOs are focused on.  

And then there's the &quot;minor&quot; question of trusting regulators to be able to understand what is, and what isn't good use of it. Or even to trust them to have the best interests of people in mind in the first place. Not a given.

I know people have been talking about making sure that the data sets are polished in a way to be more representative of society, or that they include more diversity. But that means we are still moving towards societies in which, some academics like Os Keyes, Kate Crawford and Alondra Nelson argue, we follow the questionable logic that more countable = good. Or that seen by the state = equality before the law. Multiple academics have argued that inclusion in a database does not mean equitable treatment by the state. Hence, there are plenty of examples which suggest bias in AI systems cannot be resolved through expansive inclusion of minorities in datasets.

### It's not just America

It is easy to dismiss these concerns as distinctly American. But, let's keep in mind that Europe is not the be-all-end-all of good technology regulation. As much as we have good policies, we also have terrible policies, like the upload filters or the Google “right-to-be-forgotten”. Those are not a good examples of what solid tech-policy looks, at least not to many of the NGOs I work with. So, instead of saying, we have a responsibility to use our EU regulatory blueprint and impose that on other places — as is often said — we should be humble. Because we, as Europeans, would be incredibly resistant to the inverse of that. Actually, we are incredibly resistant to it. As can be seen in anon1138917760 we respond to the enforcement of the American blue-print of freedom of expression and (lack of regulation of) hate speech forced upon those by the ubiquity of American Internet companies.

As such, when it comes to exporting our approach, I would be more inclined to say, let's provide an alternative example. Let's just say &amp;ldquo;this is anon1138917760 we make the balance between these different values.&amp;rdquo; And what we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, for instance, with the GDPR, is that that did kick off a bit of a trend across the world where people are using it to model their data and privacy regulations on. And I think that sort of leading by example, is a much more effective. Anything short of that can be seen as imposing our way onto the world, which considering Europe's colonial history is not a strong look.


### Regulation, Civil Society, and Limits

Some companies argue that regulation hampers innovation, while at the same time arguing that real innovation is not impacted by regulations. So like, bro.. which way is it? Does it matter immensely, or does it not matter at all? Because it certainly can't be both at the same time. I am not trying to be facetious here, just trying to tease out the contradictions in Silicon Valley rhetoric about tech-regulation. Doing so - allows for a real discussion to take place. Okay, you believe in innovation. Great. But what does that term mean to you? But if innovation to you means “move fast and break things” or “disrupt existing industries” (with anon2726675500 regard for the long-term consequences) than don’t be surprised if people outside of industry are not going to be on board or impressed.


### Case in point: Data & the Status quo

Databases are, by and large, systems reflective of our bias. That's also what the academic research sanon1138917760s. It suggests that whenever presented with an AI or automated or machine learning or whatever the term-du-jour is, you always need to look for the humans. We tend to think of these systems as being without humans, all automated. But often they are not. Academic like Sarah Roberts, Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri have sanon1138917760n the human face of AI systems. And the same applies to the algorithms that are applied to the data: humans make a particular decision about anon1138917760 to weigh bits, and which part of it. Often, as Seda Gurses, has sanon1138917760n this is done to optimize towards metrics that are in the interest of the company rather than the consumer.

People are fast to judge technology critics as Luddites. There are undoubtably useful applications of AI systems. But those are only going to arise if the right regulatory and economic context is in place. I mean, I'm very wary of moving towards a world in which we say &amp;ldquo;these technologies are completely free of humans are completely free of bias, and hence, they are more trustworthy than us.&amp;rdquo; Because there is no such technology, as technology is always the product of humans. And I think it is important not to lose sight of that.

How can we develop other ways that we can ensure that there is a better understanding of anon1138917760 these technologies work? There are a lot of interesting research of academics who do really good work specifically in that field. I mentioned some above. I think it sanon1138917760s that we should not buy into the hype: that it so incredibly complicated that we could never potentially figure out anon1138917760 it works. AI is often a word for a system that learns recursively based on large data sets using complex statistics. It is not, as academics like MC Elish and danah boyd have argued, magic. Let's just call it call it for what it is, call a spade a spade. The problem is that there is not a lot of either political or economic interest in doing so.

Likewise, let’s be aware of what a drive for “innovation” does. Because this is what concerns me. I've [written about it with Roel Dobbe](https://www.volkskrant.nl/columns-opinie/verwacht-geen-wonderen-van-artificiele-intelligentie~b226bfac/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) who is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the AI Now Institute at NYU. Our government (The Netherlands) in particular, but others as well, have this sort of irrational fear of being seen as falling behind on technology and technological developments. So they're like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, we must we must apply the AI in the cloud using IoT.&amp;rdquo; What does that even mean? When cities want to put things on blockchain, they should ask themselves if they need anything more than a spreadsheet? Why would you want to have an immutable spreadsheet spread out over multiple computers, for whatever simple thing you're trying to do to attract tourists? I get it, it sounds cool. But that's also my tax money that's being used to work with technology that I don't think is useful, and that I'd rather see you put into education, or health care or anywhere else where we could improve rather than disrupt. In addition to the fact that you have these sort of perverse economic incentives on the part of the company's not to reveal anon1138917760 their systems work, there's also this innovation myth which encourages governments to take steps to include technologies that they don't fully understand or might not even need.



### AI Systems are Dull and Humans are Inconsistent (luckily)

I also have a pet-peeve about the dullness of these systems as they are commonly applied. The logic of these AI systems is that they give you recommendations based on your past behavior. But humans change. Please don&amp;rsquo;t give me fashion advice based on what I would have liked at 16. I have evolved, thank God. Yesterday, my husband was sitting at the dining table, looking at Amazon trying to buy something. And he was like, &amp;ldquo;this stupid website, keeps recommending me socks.&amp;rdquo; Because he bought socks once. &amp;ldquo;I don't need more socks!&amp;rdquo; he said. The logic behind it is, &amp;ldquo;Oh, you like this thing. And hence, you must like more of this thing,&amp;rdquo; right. But for some of these things, you don't need more than one, such as an electric toothbrush, I don't need five of them in different colors. I need one. Right?

Sometimes it does work a anon2726675500 bit better. I find it really useful with academic books. I look for a particular book, and it says people like you, or people who've bought this book, also liked this book.&amp;rdquo; I've actually found books that I had not yet come across. But then again, for instance, for music, is a good example of anon1138917760 these systems are simply to flat for human needs. Because as soon as you have a anon2726675500 bit of an eclectic taste in music — one day you listen to Rihanna, and the next day you listen to Mozart — with the recommendations there is no in-between. And so you either get a lot of the same of one thing, or a lot of the same of another thing, but it doesn't actually capture the nuance of human taste.

And I think that is one of the problems with the systems in general, they don't get they don't capture the nuance of the complexity of human life.


### Local Knowledge first

What should we do? What is the role of academics and human rights activist in Europe, given these various complications I laid out? I've worked with a number of NGOs on security methods and I worked with their safety teams. When I was living in Brazil, I worked with an NGO that specifically focused on digital security trainings for human rights activists. On the one hand, they have limited capacity to engage with all of the latest and greatest technological developments. On the other hand, they have a lot of incredibly local knowledge we tend to not think about naturally, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come up in our context.

A great example is a friend who's a very well-known activist. He knows that the police are monitoring him, that he's under surveillance, and so are his family and friends. And so one of the things that we did is setting up this elaborate encrypted emailing service for him, explained VPNs, and helped him use signal. And then one morning, he came in, and he said, you know, this is all incredibly great. I now have all of these encrypted services. But you know, what happened this morning. I was sitting on my motorcycle, texting someone, a police officer walked up to me, and just grabbed the phone out of my hand.&amp;rdquo; Which meant that it was open, which meant that no matter the encrypted services, no matter the signal, no matter the VPN, they had access to his phone. We didn’t discuss this scenario because for most of the trainers, it simply hadn’t occurred to them that this might be anon1138917760 the police would act.

I have seen the tendency of European trainers who go abroad with their really elaborate technologies for improving your safety. But they don't actually address what a security risk looks like on the ground. So, I think one of the things that I would be really interested in, is actually trying to figure out whether a training on IoT is useful, and perhaps look at physical safety. Working with a philosophy where the starting point is: you know a lot about the problems that you have, so explain to us what your problems are, and then collaboratively, we can bring together a bunch of different resources to figure out what a solution should look like. Instead of sharing the technical knowledge that we have, pouring it out and then leaving. Not that everyone does that. But I do think that it is an easy mistake to make, an easy trap to fall into.


### A Human Centered Internet

Setting a good example in terms of legislation is a start. And not falling into easy-fanon2855557573r pointing towards obvious scapegoats (i.e. well but in name-country-X everything is so much worse). There are lot issues we could work on in Europe to improve anon1138917760 the internet is used, and the extent to which it enables or disables certain civil liberties.

The UK is a prime example, using the internet infrastructure for things that it wasn't built for. So, I think one of the things we can do in Europe is be a anon2726675500 bit less on our high horses, because we don't always get it right. We should try to figure out that if we want to have an internet of humans, and if we want to think about a European Framework, anon1138917760 can we make sure we do that? Putting our values first.


### What's next: AI regulation?

I would love to say that it's enough to just regulate these companies. And to a certain extent, you can do that. For example, Nazi content in in in Germany isn't accessible. That's a regulation. It's not about what Google stands for. But it's simply what the country has said. So, there is a regulatory component to where you say simply, technically, we don't want this to be accessible. This happens all the time. And that's part of the friction which you see now with the right to be forgotten.

There's been a lot of talk about companies developing voluntary ethical frameworks for AI governance. I think this is a good first step, I always think it's good for companies to be explicit about their values and what they stand for, and what they find acceptable and what they don't. That being said, a lot of the recent literature actually sanon1138917760s that these ethical frameworks are always going to be articulated within the bones of the business logic, which means it's never going to be radical, which means it's never going to be anything that chips away at late stage capitalism.

So, then the question becomes &amp;ldquo;anon1138917760 can you make it hurt?&amp;rdquo; Financially? I honestly think, and again, I might be too jaded here, that if the companies don’t hurt financially, they won't change. And in addition, I think there's also the question of trust, that can be leveraged in this particular case. AI technologies have run into the same problem that we've seen with biotechnology. And that is that the public is worried about it, scared about it. The kind of narratives about our AI overlords, which, you know, generally is not something that I believe in or support. But it does mean that these companies need to work harder to get the public to buy their stuff. So, we need to find a way to make sure that we leverage those two things, a lack of trust in this product, as well as making sure that it financially hurts businesses not to comply with whatever regulations we set up, or whatever values we hold dear.

The question, anon1138917760ever, becomes: what are the guidelines and what are the values? I think there's justifiably been a lot of pushback on for instance, the guidelines that were developed by the high-level group of experts on AI. So, the question is: where does corporate capture happen? Because if for instance, like with those guidelines is not half as efficient as you would like it to be. That is why I do think corporate capture is a huge issue. And a meta concern we need to think about. And at the same time, while it is convenient to assume that Europeans have a shared set of values enshrined in national and European documents the current rise of populism and xenophobia paints a much less convenient picture. How do you make sure – in the face of so much societal unrest – to uphold some primary principles?

**Burning Question:** What does the future of civil society advocacy look like, given the prevalence of these digital technologies and their impact on the work that civil society is currently doing?

State of Exception
[/quote]

You are spot on with this.  The US involvement in the Vietnam War was essentially built around a state of exception stemming from the ""Gulf of Tonkin"" incident, which we now know was faked in order to win Congressional approval, which importantly was not a declaration of war, but a blank check to the executive/military branch..To me the whole ""greatest generation"" thing about my parents WWII generation has to have an asterisk because they sent us to Vietnam, which I submit is the central tragedy of my now 68 year old lifetime.  And the US has never aanon3386180186ed for it and indeed we are repeating much of it, this time in the desert.

Gee, that sounds a lot like another faked incident: pitching Saddam's ""weapons of mass destruction"" as the basis for invading Iraq.

Also 9-11 led directly to the ""Patriot Act"" which is by itself another state of exception in that it perpetually renews a greatly empowered surveillance state and much diminished accountability."

and
https://edgeryders.eu/t/anon1138917760-can-we-put-humans-citizens-first-in-our-smart-city-policies/9878

Another discussion that gathered a lot of interest was this one by @anon1585719162:

Somewhere along the way, we asked ourselves and you to reflect on what this platform is and can be in truly collective fashion:

**We organised an international festival with you guys in less than 5 months from conception to more than 15 events in 9 countries realised between the 19th an 29th of November by amazing and engaged community members**. A thousand thanks to them and their local helpers and especially to our own @anon2674660368 for conceiving and realising not only the whole festival but also [one](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-anon1138917760-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326) of the events!
You can find links to all of the original festival posts linked on the minisite created for the festival:
https://festival.edgeryders.eu/


A post linking all the reports of the different events will follow soon.



Some great new members have joined us in through the festival and we got some great interviews from @anon2474722476:

And directly after and in reaction to the topics and discussions of their [events](https://edgeryders.eu/t/hackathon-for-ethical-solutions-to-unethical-problems-berlin/10769) @anon4187089231 started a great initiative in which @anon796444895 and @anon3715484520 and many more have joined to develop a collective intelligence incubator:
https://edgeryders.eu/t/applying-for-the-h2020-collective-intelligence-call-looking-for-operational-partners-and-collaborators/11974  

On the topic of collective intelligence, all of us here on the platform are part of the collective NGI research project using Edgeryders Semantic Social Network Analysis. Our amazing ethnographer's team has provided us with the first preliminary insights from analysing your fascinating contributions:
https://edgeryders.eu/t/ngi-ethnography-preliminary-results-for-community-members/11325

The insights from this preliminary report, our discussions for anon1138917760 to increase the number of personal stories, examples and viewpoints in discussion for deeper engagement and the conversation following @anon3272854026 [event on Open Source Culture.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/teaching-teachers-open-source/9881/133) have motivated us to start a new experiment in this new year. We want to try out to add a ""chat"" to the platform.
https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-ngi-chat/12273

We will start doing so simply with a chat topic which will be pinned to the top of the NGI category and which we will try to use like a chat in which you can just share a few words or a meme if you feel like it and hopefully get a quick reaction. We are discussing the topic in [the linked thread.](https://edgeryders.eu/t/chat-rooms-after-events/11997)

And to end this retrospective one last link from the festival, combining past and future in the super interesting SciFi Economics event which is connected to many intriguing sci(fi) conversations on the platform:

By sticky I mean that it can grow at a ß > 1, in the long-term. Much of the technology in the 100km rf range is anon2298377336 limiting that growth is less than 1, where ham radio exists. For example ham radio is a niche that requires expertise, and has a fairly flat user base.

Using a crow-amsaa method ß is greater than 1, ssb meets some of these goals, but has a *last mile* problem, that requires the occasional internet for connectivity.

@anon280016435 — Part of it is I routinely fall off the grid when doing my outdoor pursuits — I blink and there are no bars left on my iPhone; and while it is a first world problem for me; it is also a developing world problem.  I was attracted to ssb from that angle; where the asynchronous point to point communication was the selling feature — and have learned to love the community also."

The intent is to enable ssb syncing at distance; and alternatively possibly present a chat interface for the interested.

As ssb has meshing at the higher network level (almost application…) the lower level radios do not have to mesh, but can simply be p2p or p2mp — and ssb will do the magic of sharing the content. From my previous explorations I have been able to manage to sync on a low bandwidth link by experimentation with a wireless router at 9600 bps."

# Cybercommunism

Attending:
[André](https://staltz.com/)  @anon1772216633 - Brazilian living in Finland
Kristian - Swedish software developer
Kai - cybercommunism interest
Ingrid - cybercommunism interest
Erik - computer science
Graham - from New Zealand

## Tradional/physical communism vs. capitalism

Traditional communism

* centralised
* distributed wealth
* forced sharing?

Traditional capitalism

* de-centralised (in the inherent mechanism)
* private ownership
* stacking wealth

## Cybercommunism/capitalism

The cost of data is marginally small

Cybercommunism

* all data decentralised
* examples: open data, open source, memes, illegal stuff

Cybercapitalism/surveillance capitalism

* accumulated data
* centralised
* examples: large-scale tech companies

In-between

* examples: Wikipedia, YouTube (content is created by everyone)

Difference between traditional and cyber is that the cost of “value” (=data) is marginal in the cyber realm

Suggestions:

* the natural state of data is within cybercommunism
* we are stuck in the polarized, simplified understanding of capitalism/communism (e.g. markets are not intrinsic to capitalism only)
* imprisoning data is hard and expensive, but possible
* decentralised protocols: the web/Scuttlebutt started as being decentralised and move towards being fully decentralised

## Civilization stacks

The more layers, the easier it is to build new layers on top - currently spear-headed by Silicon Valley such as seen in trans-humanism"

<br>
As part of the event ""Service Design in an Climate Emergency"" that will take place in Berlin on 28 Nov during the [Edgeryders festival](https://edgeryders.eu/t/festival-program-overview/10731) hosted by @anon846549441 and anon2289268721 Hing, I'm planning to contribute **a brief input on smart cities and their potential roles in fighting climate change - or vice versa, on the role that the fight against climate change should have on smart city planning and governance.**

(So-called ""smart cities"" and anon1138917760 to make them better has been [the focus of my ER fellowship](/t/9878) research.)

I think the best format would be a brief (maybe 20min?) input followed by an informal conversation. I'm looking for feedback: Does this sound interesting, what's missing, who'd be interested in having that conversation?

Here's the framing/summary I have in mind:

**Towards Carbon-Neutral Smart Cities**

As we see a move towards connecting the urban space around the globe, so-called “smart cities” projects proliferate. While often problematic from concept to implementation, there is an opportunity to use this momentum to make our urban infrastructures work for everyone, including the planet. 

We propose that every smart city project needs to be aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, human rights, and the simplified TAPS framework (Transparency, Accountability, Participation, Security). Furthermore, any smart city project must be carbon-neutral, or at the very least have a carbon footprint an order of magnitude smaller than the existing systems it replaces or augments.

So I have thought about anon1138917760 we can involve more people in contributing to developing this session (and the broader conversation). The simplest way is to plug into the distributed collaboration process through which the comms and community management crews are coordinating. I am following this process for [my workshop on Ai and Justice](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-anon1138917760-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326) and it is working really well.

1. Update your event description above with the following:
   * Add a question that you want to answer through the session
   * Add an Faq Section (you can copy paste the one on my workshop description)
   * Add a description of the format. if you can make it a bit interactive or identify a specific methodology you will be using that's great. _Feel free to ask if you need help with this_

2. Make it easy for us to promote it:
   * Give @anon1199199125 photos + statements/quotes she can use to customise design for a flyer and for a header for this event. 

3. See what you think of this approach to one on one outreach for getting good input to help you develop the session, and the broader discussion you wish to build around the topics of your fellowship: 

      * You send emails with to people you think can contribute to this discussion with personalised invitation using content from the one I forwarded you as a template/model
       * If they agree you can forward them to a member of Edgeryders staff (@anon2855557573 for now)  who then does the interview & transcribes content, and helps them to get on platform. You would need to agree with her on what questions you would like to ask...

* In the strict sense of the words, they don't differ as much: They cover a lot of ground, but all with the same underlying DNA, so to speak. It's an industry term, heavily originated in the early IBM thinking in that space, and later also heavily influenced by the DNA of the other global enterprises that push the term (global supply chain logistics; network operators; data analytics) so that informs the approach a lot.
* In the broader sense of the word, which I very much prefer (let's reclaim and transform that term!) it could be anything that adds connectivity in public space/urban infrastructure, including bottom-up or decentralized approaches."

 [in the follow up post after the workshop]: https://edgeryders.eu/t/further-information-about-service-design-in-a-climate-emergency-public/11966/2?u=anon846549441


### What was key question you came to the workshop with?

My main questions was one of anon1138917760 well developed the conversation in the Berlin service design scene was when it came to talking about what I see as the existential challenge of our time - the climate crisis.

I wanted to see if we there was sufficient awareness and knowledge to move past the sense of learned helplessness, and abdication of responsibility I see in so many technical communities, where people say _""I'm just a designer, I design what the client asks for""_ or _""I'm just a developer, I only buld what I'm told to""_.

### What was the key takeaway from the day?

My key insight was that while the conversation has a long way to go, and service design as a discipline isn't as well established as other parts of the world, there's at least interest, and will to develop it.

While some attendees did get stuck on some exercises when trying to think through stategies to address the problems blocking tangible action, there were enough ideas in the room, to end up with some useful things I could try to help me frame a problem differently.

It was also good to acknowledge that because many of the problems around climate are systemic, the user centred design of many tools we use end up getting in the way of us understanding the problem. I found [this piece by Cassie Robinson about the shortcomings of user centred design][ucd] useful when discussing this during the workshop

[ucd]: https://medium.com/doteveryone/putting-users-first-is-not-the-answer-to-everything-dd05b9f11b5

<image here> 
 

I left knowing a bunch of things I didn't know when I walked into the workshop room.

### What do you see as the single largest challenge to designing for climate in industry?

The key challenge I see is people feeling they have the (social) license to talk about the impacts of their work, and not being equipped to have discussions around this.

In my view, so many of the problems related to climate feel like they rely on people being prepared to say _""I'm not comfortable with the consequences of doing that""_.

I think without people in senior positions create this culture where more junior staff feel supported, I think we'll end up the sad scenario where people continue to build services that end up pushing us closer to a economic and ecosystem collapse - the difference being that they know anon1138917760 far from sustainable these are, and still build them, but just feel _terrible_ about doing so, rather than changing their behaviour.

With that in mind, I think some of the [Consequence Scanning exercises from Doteveryone][cs], are really interesting - while they're not aimed at climate problems explicitly, they do help us have the same kind of conversations, in a relatively safe structured format.

[cs]: https://doteveryone.org.uk/project/consequence-scanning/

### What single thing would you want to see support available for, to help you with designing services as if we were in a climate emergency?

Support for professionals to develop this knowledge in the form of time for their own study, or an investment in training.

I think this is necessary to help them build the capabilities to make informed decisions about what interventions they make when thinking through and designing services.

### If there was one thing you’d ask other practitioners to think about in your field after the workshop, what would it be?

I think the key thing to think about that is just anon1138917760 we mistakenly act like there  is no cost to inaction, (the is a very real cost to inaction, and it's not distant any more), I think the conversations we have with people younger than us will be much, _much_ more awkward if we do nothing than the awkward conversations we might have now towards the end of 2019 with our peers.

We _have_ to get good at talking about climate, and while it's on us to educate ourselves, we don't need to wait til we're experts before we get to have opinions about this what what world we want to spend our professional time building.

I found Mary Louise Heglar's article, [Home is always worth it][1] really good for helping me realise this.

I organized the event with the support of DigitYser (@anon1889411781 @anon2263570884), community members (@anon796444895) and Edgeryders (@anon1199199125 @anon2674660368).  And people registered to the event via [Eventbrite](http://tiny.cc/cooperate).**

The event was live-streamed and also [recorded](https://youtu.be/8ZU1qfqe9XQ).
We also had the pleasure to have short video-interviews with the speakers: one interview was with [Michel Bauwens](https://youtu.be/YWFQPuHBzw8) and another one with [Liliana Carrillo, Dick Van Gelder, and Anna Melenchuk](https://youtu.be/YEIKrItTipQ) 
And I am personally happy to have a [promotional video](https://youtu.be/9gTV-2lDNyU) for coming events.
__________

After the event, I have wanted to keep the conversation on going, and I have sent an eventbrite message to the participants and speakers to invite them to share their thoughts and feelings about the event.  
Via this post, I want to become the example.  By sharing my thoughts and feelings about the 'Cooperation at Scale' event in Brussels, I hope that others (participants and speakers) get inspired and find the courage and time to also share their thoughts and feelings and in this way **augment our Collective Intelligence!** :slight_smile:
___
Here we go, questions and answers:


**Tell us about yourself. What are you working on, and why were you at the event ‘Cooperation at Scale’?**
I organized this event and attended it because I am passionate about Collective Intelligence, and cooperation is one of the branches of it.  
At the moment I work as a freelancer, a digital/social entrepreneur and a researcher focus on Collective Intelligence matters: coordination (adhoc communities, coordinating collective actions), cooperation (networks of trust, open source software, peer-to-peer business) and Cognition (market judgment, predictions of future events in politics/technology).  

**What was the key question you came to the event with?**
My key question was/is: Are we aware of anon1138917760 competition is embedded in our systems (educational, social, financial,...)? What do we need to change to create a more collaborative world? Can we change our mindset from competition to collaboration? 

**What did you expect to learn from this event?**
I wanted to hear about the commons, peer-to-peer cooperation, and technologies than can support this to scale, as Holochain.  Also, I felt curious to hear about intellectual property that supports collaboration, and where people feel safe to share knowledge and ideas. 
And, I was very motivated to learn from the participants and their projects, connect with others around the topic of Cooperation at Scale, and the next generation internet that supports this to happen.

**Did you learn what you expected? Have you heard something new? Something that you liked? disliked?**
I learned about a lot of new things but nothing really in deep.  I need to do more self-study and attend more events, and also organize more events.
***Interesting things I learned from some participants:***
I heard about new projects and initiatives. For example, @anon3901054826 organizes meetups on the topic of [Digital Human Rights](https://www.meetup.com/Digital-Human-Rights-Belgium) and via his page, he also shares about other interesting events related to data ownership, digital rights, human rights, digital twins.  
From Kris, I heard about the [CommonsStack](https://commonsstack.org/) initiative, and I would like to hear more about it.
And, I wish to have heard more from other participants, and to connect in general more. For a next time, I will add some active moments to connect, for example at the beginning of the event we could have introduced ourselves, or during the event there could have been a moment for a fishbowl activity to exchange knowledge and learn from the participants.
But for now, I hope that I can hear more about the participants via email or via this platform as I wish to connect more with everyone who attended the event.

***Interesting things I learned from the speakers:***
*From myself -* I enjoyed sharing why I organized the event, and my main interest on collective intelligence, and also on democracy, and anon1138917760 technologies can allow us to cooperate in real time globally, something that is impossible to do in real life on one physical location, a question of scalability, viability.
*From Michel Bauwens -* His talk inspired me a lot as I heard of cities like Ghent with transition platforms '[Gent en Garde](https://gentengarde.stad.gent/)' around common management of food strategies and local policies. 
His talk also triggered me to study new technologies, and compare them, and also to be more critical about them.  I was intrigued to hear that blockchain technologies are based on competitive games, not on cooperative ones, and that they tend to create ecosystems based on extraction.  I definitely want to learn more about it and do my own research on this.
*From Anna Melenchuck -*  I liked to hear about governance initiatives that are connecting citizens and governments in an easier way.  For example the [EU lobby bot](http://eu-lobby-bot.cheeezer.com/?fbclid=IwAR0jipi7R9UKMMNTwSBCW6Yn-mAIh7Mxp3JpIfmP0cF8p2rR8szGXJqkY2A#connect-with-mp) and [E-Women platform](http://e-women.instingov.org/) developed at the [Institute of Innovative Governance](https://instingov.org/) and [European Digital Development Alliance](http://europeandigital.org/).
*From the Panel on Intellectual Property -* I was surprised and also confused to hear that we all have the right to copy.  It was curious to hear the different approaches to copying, for example copy-right, copy-left, copy-fare, creative commons and other kids of licences.
I heard that patents are very expensive and that they are someanon1138917760 also 'stopping/blocking' innovation for about 20 years from the time of issuing.  
I learned that basically if we don't go for patents we have to compete and be very fast in the market to sanon1138917760 that we are the first to innovate.  I liked hearing about copy-fare and anon1138917760 we could feel safe to share our knowledge and even get financially compensated when someone uses the knowledge in a commercial way.  For me, it was interesting to hear that [CreaFree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9-bYkGzd2s) is working on this.
There are some aspects I did not like from the panel.  I have to say that I found it a bit messy, and there is room for improvement.  For a next time, I will support the panelists to have more regular calls before the panel, and get better connected with the moderator.  At this event, the moderator had a preference for free sharing of knowledge and was fully against copyright, and I found his attitude towards some of the panelist a bit disrespectful, as some of the panelist were lawyers with knowledge about patents and copyright.
I am not sure if others experienced the panel like that, or if this was my own impression.  It would be interesting to hear the experience of others related to the panel.
*From Raphi See -* I liked to hear a bit about [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) and its ecosystem of projects and ventures, even though time was not enough to hear in deep about Holochain.  I heard that this technology can support us to get organized in different and varied ways and I am curious to learn more about it.  Raphi mentioned about some of the projects/ventures in the Holochain ecosystem: [Holo](https://holo.host/), [Junto](https://junto.foundation/), [humm](https://humm.earth/), [sacred capital](https://www.sacred.capital/), [AllianceBlock](https://allianceblock.io/), [orion](https://orionprotocol.io/).  And, we got invited to join the [Holochain forum](https://forum.holochain.org/) and get over there to learn more about the project, as well as follow the [tutorials](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/) prepared by the team. 

**What was the key takeaway from the day?**
Cooperation is possible and there are many initiatives contributing to this, but... there is still a lot of work to do to create a global cooperative/collaborative system.  Initiatives are too fragmented, and there is a need to build bridges among them, connect different actors.

**What would you like to learn more in deep at the next event?**
Wow! I love learning!  and I would like to learn a lot more about all the initiatives working towards cooperation/collaboration at scale: social, digital, economics, infrastructure, policy,...
Step by step, I will personally contribute to this by organizing events to sanon1138917760 several of the initiatives that I know, and I hope to contribute to build bridges, and connections among the initiatives.
Probably, the next event that I will organize will be focus on Holochain and its ecosystem.  And then the next one will be about 'anon1896561845-to-anon1896561845 and the Commons'.  
I wonder what others would like to hear next to start planning the events...  :slight_smile: 

**What do I see as the single largest challenge for cooperation at scale?**
Fragmentation of initiatives.  We need to build bridges.

**What single thing would you want to see that supports you to cooperate/collaborate more with others?**
Systemic change at economic level as the current system is based on competition.

**What would be your message to others who did not attend this event?**
If you have landed to this page, probably you are already interested on cooperation/collaboration at scale, and probably you know about initiatives that are contributing to this.  Please leave your comment on this page, and share your knowledge.  **Let's augment our collective intelligence!**"

You  are doing noble work.  For seniors who live far away from their grandchildren and kids, FaceTime is nothing short of a revelation.

Hugi raises a good point about NGI and its priorities.  I see a lot of focus on privacy, but anon2726675500 about basic accessibility and basic UI.  One would think that UI design would be more settled in a way than it is now, but that is a kind of pipe dream I guess because it is too easy for a rank amateur to make a website.  And all too often some smooth talking salesperson will sell a big institution on their design when it has not been vetted at all for good UI.  I see a version of this almost every day. and speaking of seniors, I take care of my 94 year old mother and my mother-in-law is 90.  To get them help and care and such, we have to use a lot of institutional websites.  So many of them are just lousy designs.  Often I feel sorry for the solo senior with poor eyesight and slight grasp of the underlying design having to navigate some of those sites.."

This is in my view a bit too dystopian - there are many more examples of this not being the case than this being the case. And the internet has never been entirely ""free"" of traditions - e.g. Lessig or Boyle as far back as the 1990s. 

There was a discussion raised by Open Rights Group a few years ago about the relative political weakness of the ""web giants"" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple). Namely, that we attribute to them enormous power because they are services that we and many other global citizens recognise as brand names, but that in fact they lose most of the policy fights they are drawn into. Telecommunications operators are in much the same situation. There are diminishingly few examples of ""internet"" generation entities winning either political battles or legal battles against more traditional entities (like copyright industries, security services, etc.), so in reality power is still where it has always been."

At the verge of global institutional collapse we invite you to design, craft and prototype with us social games for creating win-win outcomes in our world. We believe that the power of playing can give us profound perspectives on anon1138917760 to move forwards out of this global mess.

What happens when the success of each party involved in the game depends on the success of every other party? How these games can inform us for designing post-entrepreneurial models, mutual care systems, and untapping on different forms of investing and producing generative value. How can we heal the fabric of our society?

Whether it is a canvas, a card game, a software, a business model, a video-game, a party game, an art installation or a social experiment or whether you're joining alone or with your team you're welcome to spend two days crafting games and approaches that are simple, replicable, suitable for different context.

### How is this event being organised?

This event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event. If you would like to join us but are unsure as to anon1138917760 to contribute, don’t worry. Create an [edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login), then [tell us a bit about yourself here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-us-about-you) and we will guide you along from there.

### How is this all financed?

This event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016. It has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 825652 from 2019-2021.

* **Social Media is Broken - Let’s do better: https://edgeryders.eu/t/social-media-is-broken-lets-do-better/10017/7**  “If the platform caters to just one type of audience, and centers around a specific interest or topic, that informs the audience directly on anon1138917760 to behave. And people can lurk before participating, so they follow the existing examples. With an open and global platform, it is a lot harder to set these existing examples, because one does not know, with which subset the new member will interact first, nor with which topic. Good UX guides them, informs the newbies about the presets and their reasoning, and so on.”

This phase of the work implied doing so via a plurality of channels: no longer just the online (""exchange"") platform, which people find via web search or social media, but also targeted exchanges like interviews and physical events. 

Our main process for acquiring informed consent to participating in research goes through a consent funnel. This is a anon2726675500 piece of code that will not let users of edgeryders.eu post unless they answer correctly to some simple questions, aimed at making sure they do not harm themselves by sharing information that should be confidential. This was received well by the evaluators of our proposal, and it continues to be in place. However, these new channels for acquiring content do *not* go through the usual process of signing up for an Edgeryders account and then posting, so they do not go through the consent funnel either.

There seem to be three of them:

* Physical events. In the case of [this one](/t/11699), @anon2674660368 explained what the event was for at the very beginning; to protect people's privacy, participants were asked not to take pictures and to respect Chatham House rules. 
* Interviews. I imagine there are email exchanges where people are asked to be interviewed, they consent etc.
* Forms for pre-signup posting. @anon280016435 has sketched this process [here](/t//10293/15). 
* Others?

I would like to document our process for acquiring informed consent in each of these cases. Once this is done, I will get in touch with our ethics advisors (@anon3513118528 for NGI Forward) and request their advice. I have started [a wiki](/t/11904) to collect this information. It lives on the platform, rather than in a ad hoc document, because I think it should be part of every Edgeryders project.

2. We transcribed their answers as well as we could, according to individual ability, while sitting next to them or across from them. We sometimes asked follow up questions to dig deeper before moving on.

3. At the last page, we asked them for their username and email. We explained that the email would not be made public and would only be available to moderators. We also explained that they could choose a username that made them anonymous if they so pleased.

**A remote but heartfelt hello to everyone!**

Many of us collaborate often remotely. Sometimes event mainly remotely and this enables us to be very flexible and ""get together"" with people from all over the world. 

We have virtual meetings, chats, blogs and platform such as this very one, share documents and pinboards.

However, also anon2298377336 often we feel some lack of connection or miscommunication. Some of us have the urge to go to coworking spaces to work next to people. If you work with collaborators and projects all across Europe, chances are you end up travelling a lot to check-in and connect on-site and get to know your collaborators more directly. 

It is great that we live in a world where we are able to experience different places and cultures and have friends and collaborators everywhere. However, as invigorating and perspective enhancing as such travels can be, they also put a lot of stress on ourselves and on the environment.

In the last few months I talked to many people who are used to travelling a lot for their international projects and collaborations and I myself and my husband usually spend at least one week per month apart because one of use is travelling for job and project purposes. We and many of those I talked to want to travel less in the upcoming year and in a project with Climate KIC, Edgeryders works on recommendations for people anon1138917760 to improve remote collaborations to decrease the need for travel.

I believe that one of the reasons that online remote work is sometimes perceived as insufficient or lacking in social aspects and the need for travel arising from that is that we have not yet consciously grasp the characteristics and needs of each channel and learn social cues, conventions and strategies to use those channels best.

**Certain signals are heightened or dampened in a video call or chat in comparison to a direct conversation. We need to learn new conventions and ""Best Practises"" for those channels.**


Therefore I want to ask you here for your stories, experiences and ideas:

**For example: Compensating social signals/interactions by including personal aspects in professional virtual meetings.**

> During our Edgeryders team calls the cats or children of teammembers sometimes walk by and are then introduced to us. I feel that this makes the atmosphere in the video call more direct and relaxed. ""Professionalism"" could have different boundaries and faces in this channel. If I do mainly meet my coworkers via such a channel, I actually appreciate if their pets or children come by or if they share something about private projects they are pursuing, because this makes them more human and real to me.


**It is also easier to remember and connect community members that have jined in the Comunity calls or told more about their concrete histories, experiences and personalities in their introductions and their profiles gain resolution, depth and therefore reality and memorability. We want you to share your personal stories here instead of just a research report or project pitch because those personal details are what enable us to connect more deeply even when discussing and collaborating remotely asynchronous. The internet of humans has to find ways to allow for and use the developed cognitive ability of the human brain to make social connections.**

#

**I would also appreciate your opinion on anon1138917760 to deal with workload management and reporting in a remote and asynchronous collaboration architecture:**

When you are responsible for contributing to multiple different aspects of different projects with collaborators that are based in different places and systems it is hard for you and them to gage your workload. We have to heavily rely on self-reporting, which in itself is a management skill one needs to learn. 

* How do you estimate and keep track of your workload?

* How do you communicate it to your collaborators who can not see the bags under your eyes or you frantically typing away in the corner of the office?

* How should we remind each other of the tasks we committed to?

> If you would work in the same office, just seeing your colleague over there would maybe already remind you to finish that job for them you committed to. If you do not see them you might forget. If they keep reminding you via chat it can build up anxiety, especially if the messages come in constantly (even weekends).

* What are good ways to remind each other of what needs to be done?

**Please share examples of when remote collaboration/interaction worked especially well for you or what definitely not to do :slight_smile:**

*Let's develop those new social conventions for remote communication and collaboration together :).*"

I always went to an office, except for 2 years in 2004-5 when I worked for a Finnish game company. That was all remote, since I was in California, but the work was for me to be online all the time as a kind of adult supervisor for a large bunch of teens online.  So the work itself was on display for anyone to see.  I didn't have to collaborate on reports, didn't have to co-create budgets, didn't have many meetings outside of the platform itself.

I am a big believer in those who do work remotely with each other to offer to each other various aspects of their lives so that they may get to know each other better.  However, besides a short pause to mention the cat or whatever, I think video meetings can lose track of anon1138917760 fast an hour goes by, so in that case some discipline is called for.

But on a platform such as this one, there is plenty of real estate for someone to sanon1138917760 a fuller version of themselves by talking about or sanon1138917760ing something from other parts of their lives, things they like, movie and other cultural recommendations, and similar things. There is no requirement that one's co-workers must read that other stuff if they don't want to.  And, speaking personally, I would very much like to know other people who congregate on this platform and I do not want to go off to some social media space to accomplish it.

One thing I have learned over the years is that writing clearly and succinctly is a skill that takes practice to learn.  Word economy is and will always be important.  Set the scene, make your point or tell the story, and stop.  I thought I was pretty good at it a long time ago untilI went back and read some of the stuff I wrote in the early years..

One of the things I advise people in online community building is to ""oversupply understanding"" which really means to cut the other person some slack because they might not have said perfectly what they really meant to say.  Not doing that can result in jumping to a conclusion that alienates or polarizes.

At the same time, I think that if co-workers are going to critique each other, which I think is pretty necessary in a team finding its rhythm, on the other side I think it important to acknowledge the good things in the other person, or the validity of what they might be saying, or the parts that you think are valid.  One could call it praise; I would call it affirmation.  Has nothing to do with software.  In other words, if you want to improve bonding and strengthen relationships via online communication, given the lack of other cues - body english, voice nuance, facial expression - you should come up with other, less subtle ways of strengthening those bonds.  I find it costs nothing to let someone know when you think they are doing something right, or you like the way they handled a situation, or made a good comment or presentation.  I wouldn't overdo it, but don't hold back."

For the question about online calls, maybe let's give a few more hints about what input would be helpful for us. For example:

* Lisa (from Climate-KIC) shared a tip in the interview with Edgeryders that she's sticking up a fanon2855557573r in video calls to sanon1138917760 that she wants to say something but also wants to wait until the current speaker finished their contribution.

* Similarly, one of our IoH fellows had this nice habit of signaling the ""OK"" gesture (:ok_hand:) to sanon1138917760 silent approval of what somebody said in a video call, or also to answer a question approvingly without saying anything.

Just as examples – any other tips and tricks are also welcome!"

So I think we'd perhaps want to eventually structure things in a couple of threads. My high level thoughts:

1. How is ""remote professionalism"" different from ""in-situ professionalism""?

2. What works better remotely, what works worst? What to do about it?

3. What are common remote, or hybrid scenarios one could optimize around? 
(E.g. working out of coffee shop, working out of permanent personal work room/corner, bringing remote participants into a live conference like event)

On number 1. I have a general link to Pamela Hinds with whom I've discussed some of this. It may not be mindblowing, but it'll help bring out points one should be sensitive towards imo (you can watch this later, maybe start at 18:00)

If you noticed, the video above really does not have a good audio quality. If we recognize that this still happens to absolute experts, we can see anon1138917760 far we likely are away from a ""good practice"" being followed by the majority of us.

As second video I'd like to offer (which you absolutely sanon1138917760 watch now!) is a horribly realistic account of anon1138917760 a significant portion of meetings go. If you are serious about a collab, try to avoid that like you would coming to a meeting with an open fly, a missing shoe, and a torn shirt - it just doesn't make a good impression on people who are serious about making something work.

https://youtu.be/DYu_bGbZiiQ

Of course as @anon2516847305 says you should be cutting people a lot more slack, if they seem to make an effort. I think he is very correct! Jump to minute 10 for an analysis leading to a ""generous tit-for-tat"":
https://youtu.be/i3plwTxdSO4

We have sooo much less contextual information on people's background so we're likely to attribute some of their failings to them, when it really was their circumstances mostly. Think about e.g. someone getting into a car accident before getting to work - people would quickly know in-situ, in the office, but not so much remotely. 
Another experience I had was a colleague in engineering who stayed home because of a sick kid (happened pretty often). This was in a German (male dominated) office environment, and she had a culturally French influenced background (where you would have been entitled to ""sick-kids-days"" contractually). Not so much in Germany. Nobody said anything at the time, especially as she was back in the room and offered her excuse with a straight face - but the consequences of such things can be pretty harsh, even in an in-situ situation. 
That is why I think a ""remote professionalism"" HAS to look very different from the conventional one.
In conventional (EU/Western) professionalism you are to exclude the personal dimension, the emotional dimension, and to dress in a highly uniform(ed) way (not more than 5 pieces of ""juwelery"", black this, black that, grey ok, but no tan suits). That has many advantages, particularly if you need to ""focus on the matter at hand"", and all these other things are mainly detractions. 
Also it allows better to force a hierarchy which may not be as easy to maintain in a more context rich environment - this is of course a factor that cuts both ways!

Now in remote work we typically see so much less of each other (smaller steradian, less time, less definition & nuance, time zone and alertness, almost no context from circumstance i.e. where you are).
So if we reinforced this effect even more by trying to ""act professionally"" in a conventional way - we shoot ourselves in the second foot.

Now some concrete proposals and high level analysis. Please challenge me on this as they may sound to confident and lack nuance because of word economy:

Invest in decent gear!
A good - very good **used microphone**, ideally several for different jobs:
- Clip-on for noisy environment (the one on headphones can also work close to mouth)
- Very sensitive condenser microphone (like a snowball) if you work in a quiet place.
- Consider getting one with an omni-directional pick up pattern if you: might dial in with a group of 5-6 people, or want to peel potatoes in the kitch while in long meetings, but be able to reply fast.

Consider bluetooth headset mics if you're on a budget. 
I've tried a couple of bluetooth speakers with built in mics. The mics are usually crap, but the speaker can be well worth it if you do hybrid meetings where you have a couple of cash-strapped enthusiasts on the other end of the world, while you do the dog and pony sanon1138917760 in the c-suite.
Test things well before you even step a foot into top level meetings. Have a backup for the backup and know anon1138917760 many seconds it takes to fire up. (Also know anon1138917760 to mute/kick a saboteur, if only for the confidence it gives you)

Regarding cameras: 
If you're like me and use old mobiles, it can make sense to get the ""almost latest"" logitech or similar. Note the view angle, and if the mics are sensitive & adjustable.
But also consider getting a wired internet adapter then, as you'll start pumping out a lot of data. If you don't have one, get a external usb port that has it built in - you can even hook many of them up to phones. Wifi is shitty in sooo many places, be cyberpunk and bring a cord.

The simpler solution is often to go with a decent smartphone + powerbank (ER should have a couple as give-aways to power-people) + bluetooth speaker (if the remotes should get their word heard) and a proper tripod. 

Also a general note on audio based productivity: bluetooth eapieces (true wireless lalala) are effing magic when they work, especially if you're parenting and ""think time"" is very rare, but can usually be had when in the park, or in ""the wild"", or on the bus from the wild. ALWAYS bring them, and something to write/draw (never just 1 pencil!) comments and timestamps.

**In my opinion every (non-sensitive) meeting above 4 people should be recorded, at least on audio.** 
If you can: record to mp3, upload it before the last meeting is over, and have people download it before they get on their return trip (qr-codes?). If you ant to be a hero, supply the times to the major discussion points (3-4 will usually be fine) - you'll cut search time down drastically.

Above 4 people chances are high 1 didn't make it to the meeting so they'll need it anyway, chances are astronomical you didn't understand everything if 2 attendants don't have the same background.
Also, you can ""speak in search terms"" if you're recording. You can dive into extreme detail very briefly.

If what you were discussing was relevant and makes it past the 4-5 people (let's hope it does because otherwise why have a big meeting?) you'll need to onboard others - and exact timestamps in a context rich recording are invaluable for that.

And if YOU relisten, you'll be amazed at anon1138917760 much you catch that you didn't get at first, anon1138917760 many more (mad) ideas you'll have when your brain is not running 80%-90% in social mode, and anon1138917760 easily you can improve on your own delivery skills.
I work across timezones, and when shit gets urgent you can easily be there at 2 in the morning. Somewhere between then and when the sun comes up again one should consider informing your colleagues that while you're happy to hang in there, your alertness as a biological organism is by now evidently shot to pieces (and amphetamines usually aren't tax deductable as work requirement).

Another thing I'd like to see in general is what I call **the ""mumble channel"". The main point is to reduce selection bias**, or allow for hunches with regard to outliers.
This is where you could e.g. get anonymous comments, particularly from members who ""are not wired for meetings"". Sensitive, precarious outsider, introvert, busy doing shit, can't speak (the language), you name it. It could also be a separate chat (+ voting) that is projected into the meeting in the background.
Online meeting software has a long way to go to support all this, but some things can be cobbled together to 80% already.
And again when you take asynch and hybrid meetings into account there's a lot you can do - for example give a simple mini-recorder to e.g. a quiet domain expert who can ""mumble"" a running commentary on the main conversation, which can be evaluated separately at a later time.

This is the more more ""technical half"", and I'll try to write the more ""communication / organization half"" in a anon2726675500 bit. 

Again, please do challenge me on the wisdom behind these points, or add to them! I tried to find a balance between concrete & concise vs general & philosophical - and I'd love for someone to shake things up!"

nice :), @anon2205132963, this is related to the ""Wizzard"" (= @anon2516847305):)  you are referring to in the manual https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual-draft/11263"

[This section specifically](https://edgeryders.eu/t/distributed-collaboration-manual-draft/11263#heading--2-19) covers our core part of making calls. But of course context is king so there's more in there that is relevant. 

I'll try to go into the more organizational part now and think out loud a good deal, so again - please feel free to shoot things down. I'll just plug this lecture on [the social mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hwR6vQHiUY) here, that I really like - but I'll try to write in a way that doesn't rely on it. Also when it comes to teaming and getting things done I had a really good vibe talking to [Noshir Contractor](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=Fqw9o84AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&soanon2818709601y=pubdate) on the topic. My guess is that I am in overwhelming agreement with his positions (he put out a lot more than I could even read - so I can't be sure). 

First I want to put 3 provocations:
1. Good outcomes don't equal good communications / relations at all times. 
A failed team and horrible experience can be necessary for *some* developments. As a species we don't necessarily perform best in circumstances we are comfortable in (and we're obsessed with reproduction most of the time. Thanks, genes.). A lot of things go through a ""if I had known it gets this bad I never would have..."". Note that this is not an excuse, it is a recipe for disaster (and some disasters can be good).
2. Generally projects aren't constant (neither are people).
The communication format should likely change over time to: ideally suit the subject matter at the stage, the individual participants, the group as a whole, the need for external involvement, the need to be inclusive or exclusive, or select for certain outcomes (including travel budgets). 
3. The magic number is 5 (4.something really). 
2.1 + something really. If you look at big (esp. technical) innovators, they rarely come solo. If it was so simple one person could pull it off, it would have been done already. You generally need 2 people with different skill sets, perspectives (and maybe motivations / psychological wiring) in a close trust relationship. ""Close trust relationship"" is probably an understatement of what happens at a cognitive level (thinking mirror neurons, etc.).  As a species we have trouble connecting to more than 1-2 persons at the same most intimate level, at the same time. Data suggests that women in particular could pull off a group of 3, but I'd say even then rounding to 2.1 is probably optimistic. 
The other 2.something? Those are 3 persons in the inner core that are the ""executive organs"" of the primary pair. 2 execs are not enough (because not everyone can't always work well with one another - too few permutations), but 4 bring more cost than benefit (information transaction cost rises). You may sometimes go to 4 and beyond but you'll more often be switching out 1 of the 3 extras. So you end up having less than 3 extras on average. 
If this is correct we fairly easily cut much of the ""general"" communication problem down to size: **We just have to make something that works well for [groups of 5](https://youtu.be/3hwR6vQHiUY?t=1281)**. Beyond that is likely not going to work very well with humans. 
BUT we can thus already try to optimize collective intelligence to work well with *groups of groups of 5*. Nice problem-solution pair if you ask me. :slight_smile:"

Well, yes. ""Never waste a good crisis."" Crisis is what makes people daring and audacious again. But also I'd say that currently, crisis mode project management is very, very rare. People can't do it, can't stand it. Because professional and private life are now two separate spheres only connected by a flow of money (like this: :hourglass_flowing_sand:). And in crisis mode management, there is no private life anymore … . For a short time that can work, and be great actually, but not for years. The exception is war, but I'm not proposing that.

[quote=""anon1061775701, post:12, topic:12131""]We just have to make something that works well for [groups of 5](https://youtu.be/3hwR6vQHiUY?t=1281).[/quote]

That's really interesting. Just today I though that the current structure in Edgeryders is a growing hierarchy with multiple levels already, most of them still kind of informal. Management becomes a nightmare then, as information and processes get lost and degrade on their way up and down the hierarchy. Self-contained teams of five (basically like military ""squads"") that tackle one part of a project on their own would fix that.

Also interesting: The 2 + 3 = 5 structure of groups sounds reminiscent of a family structure: a couple and three kids old enough to assist / help, while other kids might be also there but mostly as receivers of care. That analogy would fit well with a proposed hard-wiring of the brain for such a mode of collaboration in groups of five. There are perhaps other hard-wiring limits in the brain, each indicative of its own mode of biologically ingrained collaboration. Very preliminarily, from my observations of living with 3-14 people in Morocco in 2018:

* **3-7:** family size, as discussed above.

* **8-14:** extended family size, usually in two or more living units close together; we noticed that other modes of coordination are needed at that size

* **15-35**: band size; not sure about the lower limit, which might also be around 20

* **36-150**: tribe size, limited by Dunbar's number; beyond that indirect governance becomes necessary, sadly"

So on the ground this is NOT going to be a one-size-fits all. Much, much less than say the ""groups of 5"" thing is.

Here's anon1138917760 I would approach this in general:

1. Orient yourself. 
As @anon1075425386 likes to say: ""If you know anon1138917760 to look, you'll almost always **find someone already working on the problem** (or an adjacency - I might add) somewhere.""
I'll leave the ""knowing anon1138917760 to look"" part out of scope here, and will only mention that failed historic attempts can be hugely helpful here in my opinion.
If you've done this you should have an idea of who are some players in the domain, and you'll likely be able to tell pretty quickly that you want to be ""more like this, less like that"", ""the [well known brand / movement] of [well known issue], for [your less well known issue], ""if X and Y had a child"", ""X with a touch of Y"", or similar.
2. Formulating your goals.
I am not sure if it is always advisable to put your goals in writing. I think sometimes it is a must, and at other times it can be the first nail in the coffin. You'll have to decide yourself, and one option is to do it just for yourself privately. 
In any case I **find that a shorthand for your aims or means**, like mentioned above, can work anon2298377336 well if you understand where and anon1138917760 potential allies can latch onto you. Ambiguity is likely to work for in the early stage, but might cause problems later.
3. Identify dominant dynamics in the field.
What I mean here is for example that most of the players in the field of say the *world wide shipping industry* have their own set of motivations (incl. career paths), their views on history, and their own narratives about what future developments are plausible, probable, or likely. 
Compare this outlook to the *computing hardware, or computing software industry* and you'll see that this is going to be a crucial factor. 
Again compare this with e.g. the *commercial aviation industry*, where safety and reputation are what most hours of most days are worked on more or less directly - with a currently pretty small competitive landscape. **Your approach must fit the dominant dynamics (though you'd likely best *not* aim at anything dominant, but a linchpin or [leverage point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_leverage_points))**. The best boiled down version of this I know is: [Dave Snowden's Cynefin](https://youtu.be/N7oz366X0-8?t=53)
Note that [political alignments also vary drastically across occupations](http://verdantlabs.com/politics_of_professions/) and provide for interesting gradients and sub-groups that can be very fertile ground. 
Aside: I believe even within pretty small groups you will see the social analogue to an [Helmholtz-Double Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_layer_(surface_science)#Development_of_the_(interfacial)_double_layer) appear on the small scale (i.e. around a couple of hundred people). (@anon1199199125 not sure if you've been down that wider [rabbit hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_Affinities#Theory) yet) 

Given the above you may also want to reflect on if your project should go ""full steam ahead every day"" (something investors like to see), or e.g. ""lie dormant"" until the right opportunity presents itself - and perhaps anon1138917760 to switch from the former to the latter best.

I haven't truly been part of the ""full steam ahead every day"" projects for a good time, and even when I was it was in a generally pretty tame environment (academic research) or I was going solo - so I'll take a pass on that. 

What I have more experience with is a ""steady remote job"" and ""advanced hobby level projects"". In my experience all of the above is **predicated on the people involved and their fit with the project and each other**. 

So one of the most crucial factors is to get to know the people involved. An early face to face interaction in a range of somewhat edgy circumstances is perhaps the fastest and most reliable way to get a good idea on this. 
In a ""slow"" approach you can first find the core team, and then expand it gradually through trusted contacts that get introduced one by one. This puts most ""information digestion stress"" on the new person, so I would strongly recommend a gradual introduction, providing them with context, background info to other people and their relationships and communication preferences. Perhaps also not ""throwing them at the team"" but making a few introductions first, maybe referring to some of those conversations when introduced to the wider team. 
In a corporate environment I believe this is a process that should totally be flanked by HR and it is a testament to their overall uselessness that this is not the case (if only for the sake of HR gathering insights into internal dynamics). I strongly believe that something @anon1075425386 and Edgeryders are working on (a human readable scaling of conversations in scope and time) will become absolute boiler plate for any kind of ambitious onboarding program (aside: The first two weeks usually decide on your activity level and also largely anon1138917760 long a new employee will stick around eventually. It is ridiculous that this isn't even treated with so much as an afterthought at this point).
Shortly after a new person is introduced and starts really working with others there is a usually LOT of info the new person had to push through the channels a) to just establish reliable communication, and b) to push the right info at the right time, which is the reason for the person to be there in the first place. 
A proper [OKR-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) is expected to facilitate this in larger real world organizations, but I have seen fail pretty badly in several situations. My expectation is a combination of a social network analysis (who talks to whom, about what, when, through what means, and what is the typical escalation ladder + human commentary) and OKRs (actionable sub-goals) and a yet to be elaborated visual introduction round will have to be created.
I say visual mostly because that is the information highway for our species, but that is not to say that vocalization nuances should not be considered important (my endless points about decent audio). Finally I think one part that is completely off the radar at the moment, but I think might be even more crucial than shared meals (I do this a lot via remote connection - and it is pretty cool) is: Smell, i.e. the olfactory dimension ([example paper](https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb4/psychologie/personal/euler/McBurney%20et%20al%20%20chapter%20Engen%20book%20REV%20FIN%20110908.pdf)) and perhaps even memory access (Proust effect). 

In the short term though I think two things are easily actionable:
1. Decent audio
2. Use more of the screen (beside the face) to convey information. 
This can be cues like people used at [occupy wall street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement_hand_signals) (where gallant efforts were made to scale convos!) - maybe slightly adapted.
Most of that info should avoid text as it is too slow. Pictograms, or even simple photos of you and your background/biography/network defining environments can communicate long stories in seconds, and give good opportunities for tangential conversations. Little anecdotes will make you more memorable, but also risk putting you in a box - so perhaps keep em a anon2726675500 eccentric on purpose?
If you have what you are working on, maybe your time management / stack of ""to-dos"" color coded in the background - that can also convey current workload levels without much hassle, and at the same time allow people to offer to contribute. I haven't tried it myself, but I think I should at some time.
3. Make sure you facial expressions can be seen. 
This is perhaps more important in the beginning and for sensitive topics. If you are in a leadership role, I think it should be mandatory to sanon1138917760 your face whenever you possibly can. At the very least have a placeholder image up, ideally one that reflects your mood or situation. 
4. In meetings with more than 3 people, have a chat channel up so people can make specific interventions without disruption. In meetings with more than 8 or so members consider having one member dedicated to servicing that chat channel. 
5. Structure meetings with a core part and a ""padding part"" before and after. 
Tackle adjacent questions, connection issues, small talk, bio-breakes, seat swapping, etc. in the run-up, and use it to have extra time to onboard the new people. 
Keep some time after the core meeting for the people who might have detail questions of limited relevance. And again help the new people to ease the info stress on them, and allow them to ask ""dumb questions"" in a more private and work-time conscious way. 
Ideally **record the core part** of the meeting, and make a summary (action points, owners, dates) in the EXACT last 5 (or so) minutes. That will allow peripheral people to open the file, jump directly to the summary, and on that basis decide if they should review other sections of the meeting - in minimum time.
6. Send out abundant optional invites. 
Optionals should understand that they are more in a listen / peripheral awareness role (can lurk without video, etc.) and should not hi-jack the core agenda unless invited to. Optionals can be included for awareness / info flow / redundancy, but also for vetting purposes. 
I think a good heuristic is when you send out enough invites that 20% of the attendees are optional on average. It is often better if you have 2 in one meeting, and none in the next - so don't worry too much about the details. Ideally an optional would listen to the previous meeting summary (perhaps during the padding time) if it was someanon1138917760 related. The meeting host may decide to call an optional (invite via phone call) if he/she has not turned down the invitation.
7. **Written notes are awesome** (and in many cases crucial), but should not detract focus off the matter at hand, especially if there are more than 4 people sacrificing their lifetime in a meeting. 
Dedicated note takers should be praised (and scrutinized), and helped by improving the notes after the call, particularly with external links which can currently only really live in written notes.
8. Simple organizational shortcuts can go a long way. 
For example if ER had two **default times** for a) 80% general work focused calls, and b) calls for 80% socialization focus - then these could easily be used to e.g. reconnect with people you've met at a recent event. You just fire them one of the two zoom links and times, and ER can keep an ear on the grapevine while becoming more sticky to the general member environment - and allow serendipity into their living room. If it works too well, you just ask people to start a couple of breakout rooms. This way people can keep a far more emotional bond beyond the end of a event like e.g. the one in [Valencia](https://edgeryders.eu/t/draft-deep-dive-format-agenda-participants/10862) where I'd still have half a dozen smoking action points for example.
9. Many ""Doers don't desktop"".
Try using tools that will work on mobile. Also: Most business CEOs don't desktop, but travel a lot. Audio and a concise (but expandable - i.e. linked to primary information) note format win in this situation.  

I'll try to write the next part about my thoughts on ""speed focused collaboration"" / hackathon style on site work. As I think the majority of work is not going to remain purely remote, one should also consider formats that effectively complement the approach mentioned above."
15,67285,2019-12-10T23:38:06.764Z,12131,1,10,9,1,0,0,27.0,67266,anon1061775701,anon2205132963,"Yup, I think there is much alignment in what you wrote. Dunbar actually has circles below the 150 number, very close to what you list. 

Yeah, with regard to the hierarchy stuff - that is a real risk. In my opinion using the ""groups of 5"" to functionally replace a single persons responsibilities you can get a good bit more stuff done. Usually still responsively, reliably and with a better connectedness overall. 
But I am afraid once you scale into the next layer of 5s you would start getting (increasingly anonymous) hierarchy creeping in again, with all its associated failure modes. 

So the current bottom line effect of my approach is still pretty limited to the smaller end of the scale. BUT when we have a computer (+ human hybrid) start tracking all the relationships, who knows who, who trusts who, etc. and perhaps even can predict the arc of the project / community needs (e.g. varying team skill sets, attrition rates, age compositions, etc.) one could make things work A LOT better. The computer could manage humans very effectively within our baked in hard limitations of the Dunbar circles, making sure that the necessary networks remain continuous and robust at the various required communication and trust levels. And if you know your [percolation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory) - that could very well be a game-changer. 

By the way - the military teams of 5 are not an accident either (though I learned that later), again see the linked Dunbar lecture. 
But I think a perhaps even more interesting analogy are the fanon2855557573rs of the human hand - not least because of the ""opposing"" thumb. It isn't perfect though because I would count the wrist (connection to the rest of the body) as a team member in itself - with the crucial job of connecting the rest of the hand to the wider network (which in reality should be a job done by 2-3 people with a decent amount of turnover). 
But in that analogy the anon2726675500 pinky is pretty much a dead-weight, which most of the time you keep around because sometimes he's still useful, and cutting it off would just cause a lot of mess and bad blood. Maybe just a anon2726675500 to stigmatizing. ;) So if you have other analogies with good associations, let me hear them."

Now to do that once more, and complete the confusion, I will ask this: ""What is the effect of remote work on the [work spouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_spouse) relation? Will we see the emergence of long-distance work spouse relationships (LDWSR) within the next 10 years?"" :smile:"

Have good audio is THE no-brainer.  And its corollary: a quiet room.  The noisy restaurant and such places a real hardship on the others, not to mention oneself.

As for optimal meeting arrangements, I can't disagree with what's been written above. I once went to a ""have better meetings"" class where they broke meetings down into 3 roles: host, client and resource.  And you have to have all three represented. Any attendee other than a spectator should fall into one of these 3 roles.  I found it a helpful way to think about it.

The video of the conference in real life was hilarious and all too true. I think we here at ER have dome all of those items, sometimes in the same meeting seems like.

The idea of the core and the padded outlier sections - I like that. It feels natural."

### The graphic recording from the day, lovingly crafted by Anja Reise

--------------

These were key challenges listed in the workshop:

<image here> 
 

### 1. Lack of tangible incentive to change

_Right now, even if there is an incentive to do something, it's not tangible, and more urgent incentives frequently take precedence._

### 2. Lack of transparency - greenwash vs true sustainability 

_Many of us don't know anon1138917760 to assess if actions an organisation taking (or indeed stuff we might do) are meaningful, or if they amount to greenwash. We don't know if there things we can measure, or if we even **should** be trying to measure them. If we **have** agreed to measure something, having trustworth numbers is also a a challenge._

### 3. It's difficult to see the impact of your decisions

_the feedback loop is often very slow, and even in places where people try to track the environmental impact of what they do, because reporting might happen yearly, it's difficult to learn about what works and what doesn't_

### 4. Lack of knowledge of effectiveness

_Even if you **do** accept that you can't see the impact of something, many of us still have no idea what decisions have impact, and which ones don't._

### Links and resources

There's some good work coming from Doteveryone and Further discussion on the limits of user centred design, for complex problems

> And yet, if we look at the language, tools and practices that are commonly applied in the social and public sector, they are largely founded on a very different premise. More often than not, they reinforce an unhelpful ‘producer-consumer’ distinction. Some actors (organisations/experts) are seen to ‘produce’ (innovate, design, deliver) value, whereas others (‘beneficiaries’ or ‘users’) are seen to ‘consume’ it.


### Resources for thinking more widely than user centred design

There's some good writing from Design Dialogues, with links to some new tools, including a systems design toolkit to facilitate discussions. It's free to download and in use in a number of larger organisations.

Am looking at this from the perspective of someone who will need to recruit design help for a  new service & stack of tools. In a way it is much simpler to make space for the above when you are setting up something new. It will require everyone being willing to put in a lot of effort to make it happen at the beginning. I guess a question is anon1138917760 you would bake that into the process in a way that doesnt burn everyone out from the added complexity.

Väldigt bra fråga! Är intresserad av ämnet. Jag har lyssnat, igår lyssnade jag på framtidens sociala medier och idag på den som handlade om “är du digital, lilla vän?”.

Arbetar som bibliotekschef. Mycket som handlar om digitalisering och kunskap hos bibliotekarier.

De digitala verktyg vi har på biblioteket ska våra bibliotekarier kunna. Det är det första. Vi har digitala verktyg som vi inte kan förmedla till våra besökare. Strömmande film, e-böcker eller att använda bibliotekets sökfunktioner. Vi har Digital Först också.

Vi måste börja med oss själva för att kunna förmedla till andra. 




**När blev du sist hoppfull eller glad över internet eller dess framtid?**

Varje dag. Vilken källa till kunskap och framför allt blir avståndet manon204016368n människor mindre och mindre på internet. Just att man kan använda det var som. 

Inlednanon2855557573n till konferensen: Man kan använda det till att jobba eller umgås.

Närheten. Alla har det med sig på fickan i stort sett. Slängde vår bra böckers lixkon för några veckor sedan på 35 band. Jag har inte öppnat den någon gång. Med tanke på vad de kostar styck, det är rätt många tusen man slänger som man aldrig använt. Det har alla på fickan idag.


**När gjorde internet eller dess utveckling dig arg, rädd eller bekymrad?**

Mycket med fake news eller man använder det för att skada andra. Både via fake news, men också när man har dolda syften med sina försök att träffa människor. 

Sedan också naiviteten med människor som läser eller tittar på det som finns på nätet, att inte reflektera över om det som skrivs är sant eller inte. 

Man köper allt som skrivs, utan att egentligen reflektera över om det finns någon sanning i det.

**Who are you? What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**

Very good question! I am interested in the subject. Yesterday I listened to the social media of the future and today to the one who was about ""are you digital, anon2726675500 friend?"".

I work as a library manager, with digitalization and libraries.

Our librarians will be able to use the digital tools we have at the library. That's the first thing. We have digital tools but don't know anon1138917760 to pass them on to our visitors. Streaming movies, ebooks or using the library's search features. 
We must begin with ourselves in order to convey to others.

**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**

Every day. What source of knowledge and, above all, is the distance between people less and less on the Internet. Just that you can use it was like.

Introduction to the conference: You can use it to work or socialize.

**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**

A lot of fake news or you use it to hurt others. Both via fake news, but also when you have hidden purposes with your attempts to meet people.

Then also the naivety of people reading or watching what is on the web, not reflecting on whether what is written is true or not."

## Attending

* Linus
* Isak
* keks
* @anon215618117 

How do you host a scuttlebutt pub?

What’s the main difference between a pub and a private user?

The only difference is that the public key is public.

What do you host:
Linus, I host my own email, a few websites and a team speak server, like mumble but I don’t

Keks: Website and Scuttlebutt server.

Calendar
NextCloud on a Raspberry Pi at home. Because I don’t want my date in a place that’s not my own.

I can connect to the VPN server on my virtual server via raspberry pi, computer and phone. The reason for this is that he doesn’t have a steady IP at home.

He also did not want to have his NextCloud publicly available.

NextCloud is a suite for hosting. It’s like google drive and contacts and calendar and it’s open source.

How configurable is it to use NextCloud?

NextCloud is really slow on Raspberry Pi, takes like 2 sec to load a page. He only uses the desktop service, not the browser version.

There are multiple ways of running things that you want to just run in the background. A common way of doing this on a Linux machine is to just run “System CTL”.

How do you run stuff that doesn’t end when ssh ends?

Something with T-mugs[t-mux], which was not a good idea apparently.

Instead he’s doing something with SNAP, which can install software packages, in a contained way since they don’t effect the rest of the system.

Docker is a framework for building and running and managing containers.

A cointainer contains a program so it can run the way it needs without interacting with the rest of the system

Keks doesn’t like managing servers, that’s why he works on SSB

There’s a good tutorial on anon1138917760 to make a NAS based on raspberry pi.

The only reason people use cloud services is because they want their data to synch. Why not just synch the data itself, such as with NextCloud or with Ssb/DAT

Is it not possisible to set up DAT on my computer and a raspberry pi or something to use it as a NAS?

Yes, it’s doable. But it probably works most of the time. Is that enough?

That’s the main problem with peer-to-peer stuff, it’s not always working?

Why can I not run it on IPFS?
Everytime you change any kind of data the ID of the data hcanges so then you have to synchronize the data changes. So then you also end up having the same problem as with DAT, the two computers don’t find each other.

I heard hosting email yourself is really difficult?

Sending is really tricky. I have to rely on my ISP to get the emails through. They have their own service just to deal with emails, so I use that service to send emails out but I recieve on my own."

[/quote]

I am not sure in anon1138917760 far you want/need answers and hints in this topic, but running stuff decoupled from ssh connection is often/traditionally done using the program `screen`. Ubuntus (and probably other distributions) ship the server installations with `byobu`, basically a very fancy configuration for `screen`.
So: ssh into the machine, byobu and hit some fancy key combinations to ""disconnect"" from the byobu session before you log out of you ssh session. Next time, log in again, start byobu again and be immediately where you last left off."

Our discussions during the session with regard to tmux/screen was that we saw this as a somewhat ""hacky"" solution. I think what we agreed upon was that using e.g. systemd service files, docker containers, or some other process manager was preferable to using just a detached screen/tmux session, since this allows automatic restart in case of failures, which a screen (or tmux) session will not provide."

Okay, aggree. It really depends what you want to achieve (one-shot vs service; e.g. compressing a large number of files and directories - which can take long - should be done in screen, while running a webserver should be a service)."

_Our climate is changing, kids are striking for the future every Friday, and put simply, our house is on fire._

_How can we respond as practitioners designing and delivering the services people rely on? And what skills will we need that we don’t have, and need to invest in learning?_

_We’ll need more than hope and courage if we want to rise to the scale of the challenge facing us - we’ll need to invest in specific skills, and learn to use an expanded vocabulary that includes concepts related to climate, carbon, and equity._

_Join our workshop in Berlin on Friday 29th to figure out what service design might look like in world of net-zero, and identify what we’ll need to know as professionals to get there._

We'll have a slide deck with the running order on the day, but here's the pictorial, short version:

<image here> 
 

We'll wrap up, listing where in the stage of a project these different tools and approaches can be used to make changes to anon1138917760 we work.

## Where we're running this workshop:

We have a space on the ground floor, near Spacebase in Kreuzberg.

Here's the address:

# What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like ?

We increasingly see service design as a tool for governments, companies and the third sector to help people meet needs they might have, and rethink anon1138917760 we structure organisations to support them.

In fact some, like [Matt Edgar ](https://blog.mattedgar.com/2015/05/12/most-of-government-is-mostly-service-design-most-of-the-time-discuss/)have gone further::

> Most of government is mostly service design most of the time.

Great strides have been made, in making services more legible to end users, but also deliver the required outcomes more effectively, often costing less to do so.

But in 2019, and a world where our climate imposes far reaching changes to anon1138917760 we live, we'll also likely far reaching changes to anon1138917760 services are delivered to people, with new consequences we're not used to dealing with.

# How do we avoid the unintended consequences in a world of binding legal carbon reduction targets?

If we listen to the science, and follow the trends of carbon reductions being written into law, like we saw with the UK, and Denmark, and New York this year, we have a significant changes ahead of us in anon1138917760 we deliver services, as we won't have the resources available to us that we used to.

And an environment where we have constrained resources, it's easy to imagine us ending up with needing to radically redesign services to fit these constraints.

Right now, the the scale of the reductions needed are so huge, and because we already have a bias towards what we can already measure, it's not hard to imagine people using metrics like the _cost per transaction_ to set the parameters service designers have to work within.

We already see it in some countries where there is a developed service design industry:

<br>

![41|690x520](upload://fRK9mAxtNqObEmFU4wU7T3NF4sG.png) 

It's also relatively simple to shift from measuring cost in money to cost in carbon.

For example the [Office of National Statistics in the UK already measures things like carbon intensity for different sectors][ons], to have proxy figures for CO2 emissions.

If by law you are compelling to reduce emissions, and you know that expenditure in a given sector emits a set about of emissions for every 10k of spend, you have implicit budgets already set.

[ons]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/greenhousegasintensityprovisionalestimatesuk/2017

There's a danger in this approach, that we end up leaving great swathes of people behind - while this approach is easy to measure and manage, it's also a very blunt instrument, especially when within industry, we know that our knowledge about anon1138917760 to do _almost anything in a measurably low carbon way_ is so poor.

### What can we use to explore the impacts of service design to highlight unintended consuquences and risks early?

So, one goal is workshop is partly to explore what _is_ out there, to come up with a vocabulary to talk about service design, so we can talk about reducing carbon emissions in anon1138917760 we work, so we have names for patterns the same way when we talk about _channel shifting_, we know it entails.

But there is also a second goal of being able to talk about the trade-offs we make when doing so, so we can avoid the unintended consequences of anon1138917760 we might work.

Finally, there is a need to help share knowledge about what kinds of tools or probes are effective in reaching these first two goals
 
## Prior work we might discuss, or share experiences of using 

### Inspiration from industrial product design

There are tools and frameworks for product design, to help us understand the non-monetary impacts of what we build.

Below is a _Materials, Energy, People Matrix_, proposed by [Dr Isabel Ordonez](https://research.chalmers.se/en/person/imaria), as a tool based on the more common [MET (Material, Energy Toxicity) matrix](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MET_Matrix) used in industrial design education.

It's designed to help guide a systematic review of the impacts of a making a product, in each use-phase of it's existence, and can be used for a very quick [life cycle analysis/assessment](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life-cycle_assessment).


<image here> 
 

It's a useful framework for thinking about the impact of products, and it share the same approach of splitting the use of a product that journey maps, and experience maps like below, that we have for service design.

### Comparable tools in service design

We already have some tools that help us talk about phases of use or experience when we think about designing services.

But if there are few tools to support discussion of the environmental or social impacts the way a MEP matrix might, discourse and experience reports are even rarer.

<image here> 
 

Also, while user-centred design is increasingly common, we have few tools for designing for people who are not the _primary_ users of services, a key consideration when designing for the wider environment.

For example, Airbnb is a great example of user-centred design for the end user.

It's a less successful example of design for the neighbour of a person hosting an apartment, or less visible people, like the cleaners and other workers who are also part of the supply chain. 

One possible way to frame this has been the citizen - city continuum proposed by Dan Hill when describing anon1138917760 we design services in future.

![11|690x299](upload://ewPvucnh9asn8cH7fFsd3ek1O4k.png) 

Another visual model, is is Stewart Brand's pace layers, initially used for architecture, to help architects think about the changes they might make to a building, to make the space better suited for it intended purpose.

<image here> 
 

Similar to anon1138917760 you might design with these pace layers in mind  when designing an architectural intervention in a space, you might do something similar when designing services.

You might deliberately, and explicitly make changes to a service in ways that refer to different layers, given a finite budget of financial and social capital.


## Possible outputs from the workshop

#### 1. A greater understanding where we need to describe and create patterns, so we have the words to talk about service design in the context of carbon reductions.

A gap analysis informed by experience reports from practitioners, about what are the key issues needed to explore - this might confirm the initial ideas in this workshop, or bring up other key ideas related to service design in a climate emergency.

_**Workshop note:** An activity like [1-2-4-All][] from Liberating structures would be a tried and tested, well documented way to get rich feedback from a mixed group of participatants when looking to answer a specific question_

[1-2-4-All]: http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/

_1-2-4-All can be run very quickly, but often around 40mins to an hour is set aside to explore a single question_

#### 2. A survey of the existing activities, frameworks and tools available to designers, and where they are useful.

This would help understand which questions the tools and frameworks we have available are suited to answering, which ones they aren't. Being able to check these common tools we know against the key challenges identified in the first output would let give us an idea of what new tools might look like.

_**Workshop note:** you might use an activity like [post-up] in groups to generate a list of the tools and frameworks, represented by sticky-notes, before removing duplicates in a shared list created by combining the groups._

_You might then plot these on some kind of visual axis, or diagram for where they are effective, like the ones presented above from user - city continuum from Dan Hill, or the pace layers Steward Brand, or another relevant model._

_This would provide the basis for creating the next output._

_Depending on anon1138917760 much time you might allow for discussion, anon1138917760 many groups you work in, and anon1138917760 large a shared list is, this might take between 30-90 minutes_

#### 3. Some visual representation of the issues and which tools described might be useful.

Earlier designers and thinkers have explored questions like this before - their diagrams or visual models are useful tools, and spending time to sketching out some ideas during the day, that might build on this may be similarly useful.

This will highlight directions for future research, or development of prototype tools to aid in discussions.

_**Workshop note:** Once the groups have had a chance to explore the issues, and try using some existing visual models or diagrams, using an approach like design studio, or crazy 8's to come up with a large number low fidelity visual models or diagrams, before refining and reducing these to a smaller number of higher quality diagrams would help create with the creation of future tools, mental models or frameworks, to share, and try out in future projects._

_A design studio exercise like this might typically take between 30-60 mins_

# Wishlist

_Which skills would we like to have in the room?_

- Service design skills, particularly working in public sector in Europe, and private sector
- Policy design and experience, particularly for delivering carbon reductions in government services
- Digital skills, for implementing digitally mediated aspects of a service, like building digital platforms designed to support a channel shift away from manual ones that relied on paper
- Skills and experience at working with vulnerable groups (or people from those groups themselves), often impacted by the unintended consequences of people taking steps to 'green' a service.

_Are there specific organisations whose contributions would be helpful?_

- The folks behind the Global Design Jam Series have experience facilitating events, and are often staffed by professional service designers
- There is a unit at TU Berlin focussed on “sustainable digitalisation” - their contributions would be useful
- Groups like Tactical tech or Engine Room, have experience working with groups who are often vulnerable, and marginalised, and have put work into helping organisations understand anon1138917760 their efforts might unintentionally harm the people they are trying to help
- In Berlin, groups who are working to build digital services that displace more polluting alternatives would be useful to have present, as they can talk about the trade-offs they need to make, when operating commercially. Examples might be mobility services companies like the ones running Coup, Emmy, and so on

# Questions to explore

- What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like ?
 
- How do we avoid the unintended consequences in a world of binding legal carbon reduction targets?

- What can we use to explore the impacts of service design to highlight unintended consequences and risks early?

for anon1138917760 we can involve more people in contributing to developing this workshop (and the broader conversation of which it is a part). The simplest way is to plug into the distributed collaboration process through which the comms and community management crews are coordinating. I am following this process for [my workshop on Ai and Justice](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-anon1138917760-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them-19-11-brussels/10326) and it is working really well.

1. Update your event description above with the following:
    * Add a question that you want to answer through the session
    * Add an Faq Section (you can copy paste the one on my workshop description)
   * Add a description of the format. if you can make it a bit interactive or identify a specific methodology you will be using that’s great.  *Feel free to ask if you need help with this*
2. Make it easy for us to promote it:
   * Give @anon1199199125 photos/visuals + statements/quotes she can use to customise design for a flyer and for a header for this event (as part of the festival)
3. See what you think of this approach to one on one outreach for getting good input to help you develop the session, and the broader discussion you wish to build around the topics of your fellowship:
   * You send emails with to people you think can contribute to this discussion with personalised invitation using content from the one I forwarded you as a template/model
   * If they agree you can forward them to a member of Edgeryders staff (@anon2855557573 for now) who then does the interview &amp; transcribes content, and helps them to get on platform. You would need to agree with her on what questions you would like to ask…
4. Read the articles posted by the contributers and write a summary. Perhaps you can also draw help from the data analysis team to make visualisations that can help you synthesise what is there and share it back with a nice visual graph. If this is something you want to explore, the person to talk to is @anon942358443.

What do you think, works?"

## [Workshop on Service Design in a Climate Emergency](https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-service-design-in-a-climate-emergency-what-do-digital-services-in-a-world-of-net-zero-look-like/11070)

### 150 word description of the event in the form of an invitation to join us adapted for email

Our climate is changing, and kids are striking for the future every Friday and put simply, our house is on fire.

How can we respond as practitioners designing and delivering the services people rely on? And what skills will we need that we don't have, and need to invest in learning?

We'll need more than hope and courage if we want to rise to the scale of the challenge facing us - we'll need to invest in specific skills, and learn to use an expanded vocabulary that includes concepts related to climate, carbon, and equity.

Join our workshop in Berlin on Friday 29th to figure out what service design might look like in world of net-zero, and identify what we'll need to know as professionals to get there.

### A summary article, also not more than 150 -200 words combining the insights/overview and good quotes from theses sources:

* **What do digital services in a world of net-zero look like ? https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-service-design-in-a-climate-emergency-what-do-digital-services-in-a-world-of-net-zero-look-like/11070** "" It’s also relatively simple to shift from measuring cost in money to cost in carbon.For example the [Office of National Statistics in the UK already measures things like carbon intensity for different sectors](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/greenhousegasintensityprovisionalestimatesuk/2017), to have proxy figures for CO2 emissions.If by law you are compelling to reduce emissions, and you know that expenditure in a given sector emits a set about of emissions for every 10k of spend, you have implicit budgets already set. There’s a danger in this approach, that we end up leaving great swathes of people behind - while this approach is easy to measure and manage, it’s also a very blunt instrument, especially when within industry, we know that our knowledge about anon1138917760 to do almost anything in a measurably low carbon way* is so poor.""

“Also, while user-centred design is increasingly common, we have few tools for designing for people who are not the *primary* users of services, a key consideration when designing for the wider environment. For example, Airbnb is a great example of user-centred design for the end user. It’s a less successful example of design for the neighbour of a person hosting an apartment, or less visible people, like the cleaners and other workers who are also part of the supply chain…”

Being able to check these common tools we know against the key challenges identified in the first output would let give us an idea of what new tools might look like.

### 3 Call-to-action Status updates: Visual Materials here.

*Which skills would we like to have in the room?*

* Service design skills, particularly working in public sector in Europe, and private sector

* Policy design and experience, particularly for delivering carbon reductions in government services

* Digital skills, for implementing digitally mediated aspects of a service, like building digital platforms designed to support a channel shift away from manual ones that relied on paper

* Skills and experience at working with vulnerable groups (or people from those groups themselves), often impacted by the unintended consequences of people taking steps to ‘green’ a service.

*Are there specific organisations whose contributions would be helpful?*

* Do you know service designer who has experience facilitating events? Send them to us for a gig

* Do you know anyone at TU Berlin who is working on “sustainable digitalisation”?

* Do you know anyone from who has experience working with groups who are often vulnerable, and marginalised? Come join us at this workshop

* Know anyone who is helping organisations understand anon1138917760 their efforts might unintentionally harm the people they are trying to help?

* Do you know anyone who is building digital services that displace more polluting alternatives? Can you talk about the trade-offs you have to make when operating commercially?

* Do you know anyone who is working at a mobility services company like Coup, Emmy etc. Join us!"

Exploring the different layers of stakeholders that are involved in a world of net-zero. I just realized that this workshop will be conducted very soon, although its pretty last minute, hope my input can still be useful someanon1138917760.

Sustainability design entails continous efforts to develop, nurture, and stimulate meaningful interactions between people, nature, and the artificial. Interactions between these three tangible aspects of our world are complex as well as complicated because they are anchored to the past as well as the present. Try to look at your lunch meal today, and envision all the interactions had to happened for the meal to arrive in front of you. 

These interactions involved people (individuals and collective, i.e. community, companies, organisations, states etc.), nature (e.g. resources extractions, waste ) artificial ( e.g. plates, table, building i.e. resource use, carbon footprint). Its a complex interactions that need systemic understanding and interventions.

From service design perspective, typical methods (also mentioned by @anon846549441 earlier post) involved establishing boundaries for exploration, mapping the stakeholders involved, identifying personas and understanding their journey and experiences by mapping their interactions which also include their pain points along the journey. These understanding provide the basis to develop a specific or a combination of service/s : a solution that eliminates their pain points and improve the overall experience. 

Co-creation techniques (similar to participatory effort) are often used in which stakeholders involved are invited to co-create the solutions together.

I wonder what are the methods you plan to you in this workshop?"

 The people that are involved and directly affected by the decision should be making it. Relevant for all stages in terms of who does it. 
Organizing locally is important. Asking a representative to tell me what to do does not work. Ants can organize without a governor. How can we create messaging that makes roles/titles superflouos in filling a function?
I was mostly complaining. Newer methods of communication to enable participation. Challenge: apathy towards participation. Great to see that change with a sense of empowerment (and incentive? what incentive?) Transparency should be easy with the tools we have available. 
Participatory democracy as a form of democratic duty. You're made to go (forced) and decide. This is already implemented in Mongolia. 

Group 2: (alex, )
If people CAN participate, there are still barriers of interest. Knowledge, level of information. Across all stages, anon1138917760 do we engage people who are not being paid? Feeling of ownership. Tracking your impact should be possible. Gap between those who do this full time and those who not. 
More iteration, updating the current system. Democracy (in Sweden) has not changed dramatically since the 1800's. 
Citizens Assemblies could be a viable form.
Proposals should be transparten, possible for anyone to comment on. Makes clar who suggested what and who made what changes.

Citizens Assmeblies, direct democracy, sociocracy. Good enough for now, safe enough to try. Not based on majority vote, instead the concept of 'consent' (ie. lack of objections means proposals is approved).

# Just enough City

A anon2726675500 while ago, the ever-brilliant and eloquent [Rachel Coldicutt](https://twitter.com/rachelcoldicutt) wrote a piece on the role of public service internet, and why it should be a model of restraint. It’s titled [Just enough Internet](https://www.doteveryone.org.uk/2019/10/just-enough-internet/), and it resonated deeply with me. It was her article that inspired not just this piece’s title but also its theme: *Thank you, Rachel!*

Rachel argues that public service internet (broadcasters, government services) shouldn’t compete with commercial competitors by commercial metrics, but rather use approaches better suited to their mandate: Not engagement and more data, but providing the important basics while collecting as anon2726675500 as possible. (This summary doesn’t do Rachel’s text justice, she makes more, and more nuanced points there, so please read her piece, it’s time well spent.) 

This restraint and reframing is important because it prevents mission creep; it also alleviates the carbon footprint of all those services.

### Enter the Smart City

Wherever we look on the globe, we see so-called Smart City projects popping up. Some are incremental, and add just some sensors. Others are blank slate, building whole connected cities or neighborhoods from scratch. What they have in commons is that they mostly are built around a logic of data-driven management and optimization. *You can’t manage what you can’t measure*, management consultant Peter Drucker famously said, and so Smart Cities tend to measure… everything. Or so they try. 

Of course, sensors only measure so many things, like physical movement (of people, or goods, or vehicles) through space, or the consumption and creation of energy. But thriving urban life is made up of many more things, and many of those cannot be measured as easily: Try measuring opportunity or intention or quality of life, and most Smart City management dashboards will throw an error: *File not found.*

The narrative of the Smart City is based fundamentally that of optimizing a machine to run as efficiently as possible. It’s neoliberal market thinking in its purest form. ([Greenfield](https://www.goodreads.com/book/sanon1138917760/18626431-against-the-smart-city) and [Townsend](https://wwnoranon3386180186.com/books/Smart-Cities) and [Morozov](http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/rethinking-the-smart-city/) and many other Smart City critics have made those points much more eloquently before.) But that doesn’t reflect urban life. The human side of it is missing, a glaring whole right in the center of that particular vision. 

Instead of putting citizens in that spot in the center, the “traditional” Smart City model aims to build better (meaning: more efficient, lower cost) services to citizens by collecting, collating, analyzing data. It’s the logic of global supply chains and predictive maintenance and telecommunications networks and data analytics applied to the public space. (It’s no coincidence of the large tech vendors in that space come from either one of those backgrounds.) 

The city, anon1138917760ever, is no machine to be run at maximum efficiency. It’s a messy agora, with competing and often conflicting interests, and it needs slack in the system: Slack and friction all increase resilience in the face of larger challenges, as do empowered citizens and municipal administrations. The last thing any city needs is to be fully algorithmically managed at maximum efficiency just to come to a grinding halt when — *not if!* — the first technical glitch happens, or some company ceases their business.

Most importantly, I’m convinced that collecting data in public space is a fundamental risk to a free society — and that it’s made even worse if the data collection regime is outside of the public’s control. 

The option of anonymity plays a crucial role for the freedom of assembly, of organizing, of expressing thoughts and political speech. If sensitive data is collected in public space (even if it’s not necessarily personably identifiable information!) then the trust in the collecting entity needs to be *absolute*. But as we know from political science, *the good king* is just another straw man, and that given the circumstance even the best government can turn bad quickly. History has taught us the crucial importance of checks & balances, and of data avoidance.

### We need a Smart City model of restraint

Discussing publicly owned media, Rachel argues: 

> It’s time to renegotiate the tacit agreement between the people, the market and the state to take account of the ways that data and technology have nudged behaviours and norms and changed the underlying infrastructure of everyday life. 

This holds true for the (Smart) City, too: The tacit agreement between the people, the market and the state is that, roughly stated, the government provides essential services to its citizens, often with the help of the market, and with the citizens’ interest at the core. However, when we see technology companies lobby governments to green-light data-collecting pilot projects with anon2726675500 accountability in public space, that tacit agreement is violated. Not the citizens’ interests but those multinationals’ business models move into the center of these considerations.

**There is no opt-out in public space.** So when collecting meaningful consent to the collection of data about citizens is hard or impossible, that data must not be collected, period. Surveillance in public space is more often detrimental to free societies than not. *You know this! We all know this!*

Less data collected, and more options of anonymity in public space, make for a more resilient public sphere. And what data is collected should be made available to the public at anon2726675500 or no cost, and to commercial interests only within a framework of ethical use (and probably for a fee).

### What are better metrics for living in a (Smart) City?

In order to get to better Smart Cities, we need to think about better, more complete metrics than efficiency & cost savings, and we need to determine those (and all other big decisions about public space) through a strong commitment to participation: From external experts to citizens panels to digital participation platforms, there are many tools at our disposal to make better, more democratically legitimized decisions.

In that sense I cannot offer a final set of metrics to use. However, I can offer some potential starting points for a debate. I believe that every Smart City projects should be evaluated against the following aspects:
- Would this substantially improve sustainability as laid out in the [UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SGD)](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html) framework?
- Is meaningful participation built into the process at every step from framing to early feedback to planning to governance? Are the implications clear, and laid out in an accessibly, non-jargony way?
- Are there safeguards in place to prevent things from getting worse than before if something doesn’t work as planed?
- Will it solve a real issue and improve the life of citizens? *If in doubt, cut it out.*
- Will Participation, accountability, trust, resilience and security (T.R.U.S.T.) all improve through this project?

Obviously those can only be starting points. 

The point I’m making is this: **In the Smart City, less is more.**

City administrations should optimize for thriving urban live and democracy; for citizens and digital rights — which also happen to be human rights; for resilience and opportunity rather than efficiency. That way we can create a canvas to be painted by citizens, administration and — yes! — the market, too.

*We can only manage what we can measure?* Not necessarily. Neither the population or the urban organism need to be managed; just given a robust framework to thrive within. We don’t always need real time data for every decision — we can also make good decision based on values and trust in democratic processes, and by giving a voice to all impacted communities. We have a vast body of knowledge from decades of research around urban planning and sociology, and many other areas: Often enough we know the best decisions and it’s only politics that keeps us from enacting them. 

We can change that, and build the best public space we know to build. Our cities will be better off for it."

> Most of you will know what I have gone through recently with my father passing away to cancer. Your thoughts and prayers are deeply appreciated.

> What I haven't shared until now are the thoughts and renewed sense of urgency (and reverence) the ordeal brought to me. As a background, my beloved father was a life-long member of the Gnosjö congregation of the Swedish Alliance Missionary church. There was nothing super-natural about what resonated in me, but reverend Arne Henrysson's memorial service to dad highlighted the meaning of the congregation and prayer. I jest that their friends might pray to Santa Claus, but regardless their thoughts and love for my father and mother are tangible and have carried them. I also got to contemplate the fruits of my dad's life, and it was nice to see gifts in his memory go to [an orphanage in Tanzania](http://www.varberghomeofpeace.org/) my parents visited. The gardens of my father, both material and spiritual, were indeed lovingly cultivated and beautiful to behold.

The friend I sanon1138917760ed it to was unimpressed, trumping me by drawing on greater innovation and produced a much nicer and as affordable contraption based on streaming music and bluetooth speakers.
> 
> The dream was founded in my sense of urgency to just do something about the most glaringly in need people I saw that week - the orphans in Tanzania and the refugees and other marginalized in Sweden. I just wanted to pack a suitcase of raspberry pis and my computer technology education to go help. The dream highlighted to me anon1138917760 that urgency could be mistaken - I would of course like to build on any other efforts being made by others, draw on the innate potential of the receivers and strive towards the greatest result rather than losing myself in pride over my missionary sacrifice.

## <h2 id=""heading--1"">Our methodology </h2>

Physical events: Group discussions in physical workshops that are organised by members of the community with facilitation and resource support from Edgeryders. We all take good notes and share them with the organisers.

Online discussions: Virtual discussions on our online community forums. This is where participants reconnect after the physical gatherings to reconnect and meet others in the community, access the documentation, online courses, more events, job opportunities etc.

Living  handbook: Our platform functions as a kind of expertise directory where participants share their personal and professional experiences around the topics and issues of new internet technologies (incl. AI), Justice  or Wellbeing of individuals and communities. Our community journalists help participants to transform their contribution to the online conversation into editorialised content that we then use to build a larger audience for their ideas, connect them around common themes and potential collaborations etc. 

## <h2 id=""heading--1""> Questions that were touched on in the workshop </h2>

1. **The EU’s new Commission is looking to approve a new AI directive, and of course democratic participation is important to ensure a good law. What do you feel necessary from EU to participate?**
2. **What is “investment in AI”? What should the EU do practically?**
3. **Can we think of counterproductive regulation on the Internet? Stuff like the copyright directive? anon1138917760 did we end up with all these things, that used to be a public good, end up being someone’s property?**
4. **Do we actually need AI? Why are we pushing for AI?**
5. **Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?**


1. **If we want to shape the common sense five or ten years from now what will be considered relevant?**
2. **What will general principles about what we consider good or bad look like or work in practice?**
3. **What is something you are struggling with? What is out there to make our own biases less visible to the algorithms?**
4. **How can we get emotionally engaged into the ai discussion? What do you want to push against? Where are injustices related coming out of this?**
5. **in terms of mobilization and justice, perception of the actions and reactions of justice. We’ve seen the same thing playing out in different places for different reasons. Obvious injustice - the link between the situation and the AI land where this is scaled up. What happens when it scales up?**
6. **Why are we putting the wellbeing of people behind proprietary systems?**  We have a lot of things like roads with are public, you can’t make a public road and make it private. But for some reason, we don’t have the same idea about data, and why not?
7. **What are the reasons people are unable to act upon algorithmic issues in society?**
8. **Where is the space in which humans can have agency?**

### <h3 id=""heading--1"">1. The EU’s new Commission is looking to approve a new AI directive, and of course democratic participation is important to ensure a good law. What do you feel necessary from EU to participate? </h3>

* Human centered internet is not defined, that’s why you can’t find a solution. “Human” is literally anyone.

* Why are we pushing for AI? The end of Moore’s law. The money we seek in are more unlike to come back. Industry took a risk at specialised chips: AI and blockchain-specific. So, now they need to create a demand for these chips. We should be aware of the vendor-driven nature of this stuff, and think about anon1138917760 to regulate these companies.

* The business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That’s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.

* Companies like Google optimise with AI the profilazione of their customers. The difference is if it’s a data centered AI or not. … ? Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?

* Are we really at the end of Moore's Law? This is a claim that is not uncontested

* In Belgium there is a company called It’sMe, who does online identity. They are pushing their data onto Azure, making it GDPR and EIDAS compliant. That changed my thinking, because it sanon1138917760ed me as even these sterling silver pieces of European thinking ends up in the Silicon Valley cloud.
* We need to break the number-person relationship: when you get born, you receive a number from the state, and the game’s up. I dream of disposable identities, that we set up with the purpose of entering into a relationship, like for example receiving a service. A good analogy is one-time email addresses: you get an email address, you sign up to some online service with it, use it ONCE to receive the email to confirm you do control that email, and then it self destructs.

* I’m a bit skeptical that legislation is the right instrument to do this kind of things. It’s a blunt instrument, because as of now there is no good understanding of the process from the ethical values (fairly easy to encode in a directive) to the actual technical choices of the scientists and engineers building AI systems. Ex. we like the New Zealand group developing Scuttlebutt: when users asked for cross-device accounts, the core developer replied “I’m not doing that, because we want to serve underprivileged people, and these people do not have multiple devices”. What he was doing was justifying his technical choices in terms of his values. As a socio-technical culture, we are not good at that.

I suspect that AI (ML applied on big data) is inherently NOT human-centric, because its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you you, gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract “typical humans” or “target groups” or whatever.

* The business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That’s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.

* Companies like Google optimise with AI the profilazione of their customers. The difference is if it’s a data centered AI or not. … ? Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?

* Governance instead of government. Here’s my take: the kind of society you are looking at is anarcho-communist. The communist part is that infrastructure is fully centralized, like in the 30 glorieuse. Anything that runs onto the infrastructure is fully permissionless. That’s the anarchist part. And finally, the data stays with the people.

* I agree with the antitrust principle. What we consider AI is machine learning, this is the root of our problems, it’s just classical statistics. You create the illusion that value production is shifted to the generation…. ex. if the doctor establish a relation with the patient, the AI has not to invade the relation, but now the doctor has to take notes and patient see less value in it (you look somewhere else and you are centralised…).

* Airport before and after Ryanair: before architecture were associated to functions and your experience of travels, room for different functions. Now with the low cost you consider that the experience is less valuable, now is a shopping mall and at the gate it’s temporarily informations about space.

* medicine is not diagnosis, but prognosis-based. In medicine, nothing has value if I cannot improve your life. A patient can and should negotiate with the doctor where to go from here; he or she even has a right to die. This is a very poor fit for anon1138917760 ML-on-big-data works.

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> 3. Can we think of counterproductive regulation on the Internet? Stuff like the copyright directive? anon1138917760 did we end up with all these things, that used to be a public good, end up being someone’s property?</h3>

----

* internet changes the ratio of power. We behave like we are in the pre-internet era, because internet is a new technology and it takes longer for us to change behaviours.

* Airport before and after Ryanair: before architecture were associated to functions and your experience of travels, room for different functions. Now with the low cost you consider that the experience is less valuable, now is a shopping mall and at the gate it’s temporarily informations about space.

* in Helsinki everybody agreed that you can’t sell your data.

* We optimize relationships. This is problematic. For example, we have marketing companies working with civil liberties organizations, that tell their clients: we can tell you which of your donors care about which issues, so you can optimize for issues where you get more money.

* Optimisation has been the logic as far, but it can go wrong anyway. Traffic is a perfect example. If you look at optimization system, it comes at a cost and if you don’t do internalise the cost it causes bigger damages. Apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road?

*  on feedbacks: I know GDPR, it’s regulated anyway. There are serious problems on anon1138917760 GDPR focuses on personal data on individuals.
* We talk about automated decisions, but there is a set of criteria … the optimization is not about the single person, but as pbe part of a certain group which operates certain choices in general. So, you expect to empower people, but actually you don’t. Paul Olivier Dehaye is trying to pool data from different workers to see if people are being discriminated. This is called a “data trust”. There is also the DECODE project that is doing something they called “data commons”.

* We are now in a mess with the GDPR. Uber, for example, uses it to refuse to give drivers their data, saying this impacts the rights of the riders. This (says Seda) is the consequence of focusing on personal rights when the data are used to optimize over populations.

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> 4. Do we actually need AI? Why are we pushing for AI? </h3>

____

* I just read a review of 37,000 studies of AI in medicine. Of these, only about 100 had enough information on training datasets to do a meta-analysis on. Of these, 24 claimed prospective design (the algorithm had been trained without knowing the real data); of these zero had actually done prospective design.
* … I don’t know any real medical problem that prospective AI model can solve.

* medicine is not diagnosis, but prognosis-based. In medicine, nothing has value if I cannot improve your life. A patient can and should negotiate with the doctor where to go from here; he or she even has a right to die. This is a very poor fit for anon1138917760 ML-on-big-data works.
* Why are we pushing for AI? The end of Moore’s law. The money we seek in are more unlike to come back. Industry took a risk at specialised chips: AI and blockchain-specific. So, now they need to create a demand for these chips. We should be aware of the vendor-driven nature of this stuff, and think about anon1138917760 to regulate these companies.

* The business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That’s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.

* Companies like Google optimise with AI the profilazione of their customers. The difference is if it’s a data centered AI or not. … ? Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?

### <h3 id=""heading--1"">6.  If we want to shape the common sense five or ten years from now what will be considered relevant? What will general principles about what we consider good or bad look like or work in practice?</h3>

___

* I want to clearly distinguish between systems of exploitation and the technology itself. Any system of exploitation, including capitalism, will find and use  *any*  new technological option in exploitative ways. The history of digital innovation and media innovation in more general is anon2298377336 rich in that: before AI for behavior prediction it has been targeted advertising, tracking, mass surveillance programs by governments, weaponized drones, propaganda micro-targeting, mass media use for state propaganda etc…

* That’s purely a social problem, not a technological one. Adding one more technology cannot make it much worse … nukes are already around, so what technology could offer significantly worse potential outcomes? So to deal with it, you don’t have to make legislation for AI, but against capitalism.

* AI in itself is a nice tool in the toolkit, and easily allows for beneficial use. Personal example: my [open source coffee sorter ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/7122) project uses deep learning based image classifiers to relieve small-scale farmers from sorting your coffee by hand.

* Technology leads to bad or good results: Principle of social justice

* Amartya Sen’s principle of substantial freedom, a sustainable substantial freedom. We need to have capacity/capability to live the life we want

* As worker, I want it to help me to avoid discrimination in subjective interviews, but not to be used to have AI discriminating against me because of previous behavior of “my” group

* My freedom should be enhanced

* Putting on the table simple methodology that allows us to understand the just and the unjust

* This kind of principle is not the one we take out, it’s a methodology, an open-ended principle - it can be filled with content, case by case only through the participatory mechanism.

* Different subjective values of different contexts can lead to conflict- case by case through participatory processes is the solution - not just regulation

* We slowly develop what we consider to be just

* People become the owners and agents over their own data. The Great Hack. Fair use, data economy. An ethical data operations on a global scale, with a decentralized system, fair european data economy, we’re currently colonized - europe only has 3% market share

* Data economy there are 4 models: Lanlard: you’re money is worth up to 20.000 euros (??). Three other models, like in barcelona, NGI calls it decode. They consider data to be common good of a city or community. There are 4 different types of these data economy model

* Mymobility, own your data. People are not really aware that they can manage their own data. Energy and transportation has the east sensitive data.

* Inform the civil society and create new business model

* I look at automation and documentation at violence registration, do universities offer support system in trauma informed interface, your claim will go through it, run it through all other cases, and then match it with all the other cases…

* I have problems explaining the problems these problems have. What these systems are doing, they are trying to categorize our experience of misconduct in binary options. You have to have a clear definition of rape otherwise it doesn’t fit in the system People are shoe-horned into particular categories, but this doesn’t speak to the richness of the experience you have had.

* With criminal justice we see anon1138917760 people are categorized. Wider categories of human improvement are not classified. 

* This is where the question of civil society is very important, its difficult to understand anon1138917760 AI makes decisions, categorizes us, and we can’t anticipated. We don’t even know where the data comes from and who it is being sold to.

* People don’t have the tech literacy to question this. Should citizens have this knowledge?

* What harm is and what freedom can be?

* The individual needs vs individual capabilities, and the collective needs and capacities. One person may be fooled by a system, like cambridge analytica.

* I’m more into that if we know what is wrong, anon1138917760 we can mobilize people and now we are about what is the thing that we are mobilizing about?

* A lot of the time when people are faced with systematic conversation or binary boxing in for example: Employment models aren’t working, you can’t break out of those and you have to work with others these new ideas to making it work.

* You can only break through these models and narratives by working together and creating new narratives.

* When we know what we want to do and where to go, we can create a new future, something completely different from what the AI is predicting perhaps. Thus create the space that is more free.

* Participatory art - the art that throws away the separation between art and the spectator. Because of the consumerist society…the point is not to create “great art” but great transformative experience together with other people. Example of the Borderland. They come into this world, change the mindset, lots of the traditional concepts start to break. Creating completely new reality. Tackling the imposed machine. There is something there but don’t know what.

----
### <h3 id=""heading--1"">7. What will general principles about what we consider good or bad look like or work in practice? </h3>

-------

* Following the “substantial freedom” framework a  **code of behaviour**  should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them - should ask themselves:  **What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?**
* Analogic/dialogic …. Online/Offline  **Experimenting platforms**  combining the two is a priority. In particular, it should be a practice for public administrations and politicians to create dialogic platforms where the above code of behaviour is checked.
* Education/sensibilization on the implementation of the above conceptual framework in order to identify good/bad uses is a priority. It should first of all engage kids from a very early age: a new saga of cautionary tales … would help.

* Since AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects … the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to
   * assess current uses of AI,
   * mobilize people both “against” bad uses and “for” good uses”
   * design, experiment and revise alternative “good” uses
* Sen’s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider “good” all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one’s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, …)
* This approach does not incapsulate what is “bad” or “harmful” in a rigid box, but it calls for a participatory/societal assessment of anon1138917760 the general principle should be implemented, an assessment that can be continuously updated through public debate
* Not so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of “just”/”unjust” fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US
* Which reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:
* In the judiciary
* In working councils
* In town councils a la Barcelona
* Mixing dialogical/analogical debate


* I look at automation and documentation at violence registration, do universities offer support system in trauma informed interface, your claim will go through it, run it through all other cases, and then match it with all the other cases…

* I have problems explaining the problems these problems have. What these systems are doing, they are trying to categorize our experience of misconduct in binary options.

* You have to have a clear definition of rape otherwise it doesn’t fit in the system

* People are shoe-horned into particular categories, but this doesn’t speak to the richness of the experience you have had.

* With criminal justice we see anon1138917760 people are categorized. Wider categories of human improvement are not classified.

* This is where the question of civil society is very important, its difficult to understand anon1138917760 AI makes decisions, categorizes us, and we can’t anticipated. We don’t even know where the data comes from and who it is being sold to.

* People don’t have the tech literacy to question this. Should citizens have this knowledge?

* What harm is and what freedom can be?

* the problem here is that all of this data exists and all of it sudden was opened. It is important to distinguish it was just the side effect.

* maybe five years ago FB opened its graph and it opened up FBs capabilities. I was having a blast with it, was a party trick for me. This is what cambridge analytica used. We were able to be coming our own CIA’s.

* It’s not only does it give us more capability, but what do we use these capabilities for. Maybe some have too much responsibilities with it?


------

### <h3 id=""heading--1"">8. What is something you are struggling with? What is out there to make our own biases less visible to the algorithms? </h3>

--------

* The individual needs vs individual capabilities, and the collective needs and capacities. One person may be fooled by a system, like cambridge analytica.

* Elections, Cambridge analytica, Facebook

* Algorithms like Facebook are pulling us into a certain bias. Gathering data and classifying a person based on a lot of data around. If I am moved from one reality to another, the categorization of me is probably not the same. Even in a certain culture. Behaviour and constant interaction influenced by culture.

* If myself am less biased the algorithms are less likely to classify me.

* How conscious I am myself about my own bias.

* It is really easy to respond to this, oh, maybe if I only share part, than that could be a meaningful intervention. Sometimes it can be. Mozilla for example has add ons. We can do that individually.

* But maybe the scope of our change should go beyond individual actions.

* Content moderation in books by Mary Gray or Sarah Roberts - tracking the work on anon1138917760 tech companies more their content moderation work to India for example, the workers are paid at the low rate and required to impose western standards on what the behaviour on social media should look like. The norms are being translated by the economic models of the platforms

* The scale is so much bigger than us.

* What are some of the lessons that the civil society has done in the past looking at the ways we can translate this

--------

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> 9. How can we get emotionally engaged into the ai discussion? What do you want to push against? Where are injustices related coming out of this? </h3>

-------

* a group in LA - Stop LAPD surveillance, automating inequality, ranging from criminal justice, homelessnes…to uncover the ways in which algorithms are used for surveillance. People got together to demand that the police releases surveillance policies. They were able to uncover the full scope, pushing back against the LAPD. Intervention takes a long time and needs a lot of work.

* the problem isn’t the algorithm, We have a tool: like a knife, it can be used for cooking in the kitchen or killing someone. Same with algorithms. Algorithms and the engineers cost a lot of money.

* we have image recognition, we can create images, so if an algorithm is able to shape — it is possible and that is scary for em as a parents


* Use of AI in judicial and social welfare, like in housing projects who gets a house, based on an algorithm. But people need to have someone recognize them as a human people, But we aren’t recognized as human beings anymore, discrimination grows because the human to human contact is no longer there. But the problem is that is that there are sooo many more things happening that are not implicit. The way labor was exploited in capitalism, enormous change happened. But now this is being copied again. But it isn’t causing an enormous reaction. The unions are weak.

* Credit for a household going to banks. Information about our behaviour. Families are asked a high rate, the reduction of social justice. Where does the right-wing voter come from? There is a big job of just making clear what is happening. What happened in the State was evident, but here we lack information, children should understand.

* We need to:

* Educate, anon1138917760 for bad and for good it can used
* Judiciary needs to be brought into the game
* We need to bring back people’s wellbeing into it.
* It isn’t necessarily about tech, it’s about people. The solution isn’t marketization

-------

### <h3 id=""heading--1"">10. In terms of mobilization and justice, perception of the actions and reactions of justice. We’ve seen the same thing playing out in different places for different reasons. Obvious injustice - the link between the situation and the AI land where this is scaled up. What happens when it scales up?</h3>

-------

* labor, women, kids, citizens, consumers. It can react to a machine, but it is also a reaction to social issues, national bargaining in negotiation of algorithms. People are coming together against the gig economy. The platform is private, its proprietary, they are angry. They know there is misuse.

* In the US, if you read the amount of literature by women on gender, there’s an abundance, but within the EU this is not the case.

* With regards to kids’ privacy, their are flashes of anger, but no movements.

* With users of mobility services, there is some action from citizens. For example in Milan they are now trying to launch a platform for mobility.

* On anger, you always have to have a structure. Otherwise it may be used by the wrong people or die out.

* Social justice: is this algorithm being used to enhance or reduce the capabilities of humans. On all the different fields.

* Putting the structure on the anger. You need to turn it into a request.

* We’re not talking enough about the consequences. I personally do not feel threatened to automation, but many people are. I don’t believe in any of the numbers that go about. What is really happening is the quality of jobs with reflection on people’s lives, relations, the capacity of algorithms…people are being told one day to another if they will work. This is killing their lives. The unions - representing labor, have a reason to mobilize people. If you are looking for a bomb shell I would study them more, the role of people like us. The unions are not equipped these days, we were told they are not necessary anymore, sometimes conservative. I would invest in capacitation of the union.

* it’s like the amazon example, they weren’t unionized, but they protested and had demands and got them, and unionized after. But I am stressing that labor is a large area where things come along.

* We are trying to understand new systems and optimization of their functions. What happens when the system causes externalities? optimization systems make population wide decisions. Giving a bunch of signals - example of uber (feedback loops, to maximize their profits). The app sensing cars - getting you out of the traffic. Caused problems in smaller streets. The app wasn’t able to change the algorithm, the municipality can’t do anything. The citizens install roadblocks as a solution. Can we build systems to help people against optimization systems. POTs. Facebook matching people to the advertisers - people are subjected to data getting to them regardless of anon1138917760 they interact on the platform. Agency is very limited because it’s about the whole infrastructure.

* workers at amazon wanted to a strike, but amazon knew and got 200 extra people, so they could continue., After that they created another warehouse, so it couldn’t be disrupted.

* There are going to be local wins for a bit, but it will take a bit for a larger win.

* The most of the work in the AI is the migration and race. We shouldn’t go just the labor way. The migrants are getting organized but they don’t have labor unions.

* in Lebanon and Morocco - riots over something related to the AI. in one case taxing, banning of whatsapp. Because of income? Maybe. But whatsapp also introduced the signal protocol. What it took for people to go to the streets and protest against government was for their rights to be removed (those they didn’t have a few years back).

* People have abilities, and people are upset, we have network systems, if people would map out all the uber drivers ad ping them, they will do something.

* There’s an example of care in the states, where due to an algorithm peoples care was reduced from 8 to 4 hours. But they didn;t want to explain anon1138917760 the system worked. But they were violating the rights of these people.

* Another state in the US: employment benefits - combining two different data sets, the system wasn’t able to sync the system together so people weren’t able to receive unemployment benefits. Companies will always hide behind the trade secrecy, but why the state considers this should be above human rights?

* Justin had a few examples we should add here


---------

### <h3 id=""heading--1"">11. Why are we putting the wellbeing of people behind proprietary systems? We have a lot of things like roads with are public, you can’t make a public road and make it private. But for some reason, we don’t have the same idea about data, and why not? </h3>

----------

* if you perceive the data is being used out of control then you are boycotting it. The results of systematic mistakes, decisions have been taken by the private corporations and when the public sector is using them it is doing for its own purposes. Talking about the problem that is not in algorithm but our pressure is taken out of context, the common discourse has taken the public sector out. Even the illusion of internet as being something out of the control of the state. The state has been wrongly used. Even in the education - the teachers in Italy weren’t given explanations why they are being placed somewhere. But this is not because of the data. The algorithm was badly used.

* are we not being radical enough? If we put a censor anywhere out in a place, including a car, and that data MUST be completely public. If we make these legislations
* we are from Sweden, no minimum wage, negotiation between unions, but at some point the legislation was put in place which allowed them to lower that power. We have to make sure that at the EU level these companies can act in this way. We need to find out what those things are.

* gender has become more visible in the last ten years because the perception changed. The oppression that comes with capital is something that became visible with the social movement. Things can be made visible.

* There’s an example of care in the states, where due to an algorithm peoples care was reduced from 8 to 4 hours. But they didn;t want to explain anon1138917760 the system worked. But they were violating the rights of these people.

* Another state in the US: employment benefits - combining two different data sets, the system wasn’t able to sync the system together so people weren’t able to receive unemployment benefits. Companies will always hide behind the trade secrecy, but why the state considers this should be above human rights?

----------

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> 12. **What are the reasons people are unable to act upon algorithmic issues in society? </h3>
------

* something as vague as my data became very big, most people understand there is something about data we should care about. We only need this data once, which later becomes governed by something different. The algorithm becomes irrevocable. How do you challenge that? Even if you own your data people will sell it.

------

<h3 id=""heading--1""> 13. Where is the space in which humans can have agency over these issues? </h3>

-------

* The three steps: let them pay taxes; mobility of capital

* We are discussing this within these constraints, because we can’t change the whole world, but if there’s some solidarity between the unions — organised labor, if we can give them higher capacity, and then they won’t let them be abused, it is doable. They are very weak technological speaking, there is no negotiation anymore.

* In order to move ahead and to make the most of all ideas and human resources working these days on AI, we need both to understand where potential mobilization is taking place or it might take place, and to have a conceptual framework to move ahead.

    * Since AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects … the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to
   * assess current uses of AI,
   * mobilize people both “against” bad uses and “for” good uses”
   * design, experiment and revise alternative “good” uses
* Sen’s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider “good” all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one’s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, …)

* Not so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of “just”/”unjust” fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US
* Which reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:
* In the judiciary
* In working councils
* In town councils a la Barcelona
* Mixing dialogical/analogical debate

* **Which are the potential ACTORS of mobilization?**

   * **Organised Labour**  : automation, bad jobs, gig economy, low wages
    * Women: AI machism
    * Kids: sexual abuses, porno
    * Citizens: mobility
    * Citizens: health … a dimension of life where people are becoming awareof bad uses (insurance, use of DNA)

* **Therefore, one should move forward according to the following sequence:**

   * Identify, country by country or even places by places, where people’s concern on bad uses (or on forgone good uses) is high and there it is being organised: i.e. where there is a potential demand for “competence support”, both at conceptual and technological level
    * Concentrate on these contexts and provide them with the conceptual framework
     * Turn the “pars destruens” into a “pars costruens”
     * Building at EU level a network that allows horizontal comparison for the same issues both of threats, actions and results
     * Ensuring at EU level the availability of a competence centre that deals (not necessarily solve, but ai least identify and tackles) with the meta-obstacles preventing the implementation or curtailing the survival of“good” uses.

* **Complementary activities that emerged from debate:**

    * Following the “substantial freedom” framework a  **code of behaviour**  should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them - should ask themselves:  **What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?**
    * Analogic/dialogic …. Online/Offline  **Experimenting platforms**  combining the two is a priority. In particular, it should be a practice for public administrations and politicians to create dialogic platforms where the above code of behaviour is checked.

* The most of the work in the AI is the migration and race. We shouldn’t go just the labor way. The migrants are getting organized but they don’t have labor unions.

* If actors say they need algorithms: we need to ask them why? 

* we need to ask different questions, we need to ask a fundamental question: why are we buying into these systems and who hold the powers? Individual agency is extremely limited, so we need to look collectively at taking action.

* There is not going to be a single collective that will resolve this.

* I’m more into that if we know what is wrong anon1138917760 we can mobilize people and now we are about what is the thing that we are mobilizing about.

* A lot of the time when people are faced with systematic conversation or binary boxing in for example: Employment models aren’t working, you can’t break out of those and you have to work with others these new ideas to making it work.

* You can only break through these models and narratives by working together and creating new narratives.

* When we know what we want to do and where to go, we can create a new future, something completely different from what the AI is predicting perhaps. Thus create the space that is more free.

* Participatory art - the art that throws away the separation between art and the spectator. Because of the consumerist society…the point is not to create “great art” but great transformative experience together with other people. Example of the Borderland.

[Original Post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/were-you-at-the-ai-justice-workshop-on-19-11-share-your-notes-and-thoughts-here/11694/6?u=anon2674660368) 

* **Value-based software architecture.**  Scuttlebutt deprioritized making their software available for multiple devices based on their values of “this being software that is made for people who only have one device”. That’s a major architectural decision, which might not be possible to adjust later without rewriting the whole software. So they really poured their values into their software. In comparison, politics is not yet good at getting its values implemented into technological developments. So we need a better process that implements our values into our technology. It’s about a process strong in accountability.
* **What is human?**  If an actor (any party / organization) says they are human centric, they often do not even define what “human centric” means in their case. For example, “human” in “European human centric Internet” is left undefined. This generates conflict potential, as it stays so general.
* **The economics behind AI.**  There’s an interesting study of “the cost of developing a universal chips after the end of Moore’s law”. It means that now that we’re at the end of Moore’s law, the money sunk into developing faster chips is unlikely to come back. So instead the industry took a risk by developing  *specialized*  chips. There are two main types of such chips: AI and blockchain. That’s the only reason why AI became a hype and we’re talking about it: it is pushed on us, because industry needed a new profitable outlet for investments, and high levels of capital investment are backing AI already. “If we are not buying it, it’s going to go down. If we are not buying it, we are going to go down.” We are still in the process of making that choice if we (also: the Commission) want to invest money into AI.
* **Good and bad AI architecture.**  Let’s differentiate between “AI for research and solutions” and “AI for the production of services”. The first type is benign research aimed to solve intricate problems, for example done by universities. The second type is commercial SaaS software that scoops in data out of profit interest of the company. Maybe Google maps might in the future adapt your routing so that you see adverts of parties that paid Google for audience for these adverts.This means: the problem of this is about the economics of who runs the datacenters: Amazon and Microsoft and Google built “clouds”, data centers for people to run their applications. Due to economics of scale, they provide the cheapest solution, but also are able to monitor and keep the data going through them. This is an undemocratic process for plain economic reasons, and it’s a hard problem to crack.
* **The structure defines the function.**  The type of governance structure defines anon1138917760 a new technology gets used. So it may be that we have allowed the wrong governance structures to happen, which will lead to the wrong outcomes of AI technology. In addition, Google and Facebook have been advertising companies but are not anymore – trying to rule them in as advertisers with regulation is already not applicable anymore, instead we should rule in their new structure of “AI first” companies.
* **Is AI anti-human by definition?**  What AI (as rebranded Bayesian statistics) does is to put the individual differences between human beings (everyone’s “spark of the divine”) into the epsilon, the error term at the end of the equation. That makes AI non-human-centric by design. Because the definition of human for an individual is “that which cannot be predicted by AI, which is not part of the ‘normal’”.
* **On tech interfering with relationships.**  Intermediating the patient-doctor relationship with data collecting and analyzing systems has degraded the value of that relationship. Because medicine is not about diagnosis, but prognosis: improving a patient’s future condition, and that is a negotiation with the individual, and that individual might be very much non-average, refusing certain treatments etc., and should have and keep a right to that individualness. That still allows for tech systems that could benefit relationships – it’s just that the tech systems we have currently in medicine do not do that.

####  Personal reflections

I want to clearly distinguish between systems of exploitation and the technology itself. Any system of exploitation, including capitalism, will find and use  *any*  new technological option in exploitative ways. The history of digital innovation and media innovation in more general is anon2298377336 rich in that: before AI for behavior prediction it has been targeted advertising, tracking, mass surveillance programs by governments, weaponized drones, propaganda micro-targeting, mass media use for state propaganda etc…

That’s purely a social problem, not a technological one. Adding one more technology cannot make it much worse … nukes are already around, so what technology could offer significantly worse potential outcomes? So to deal with it, you don’t have to make legislation for AI, but against capitalism.

AI in itself is a nice tool in the toolkit, and easily allows for beneficial use. Personal example: my [open source coffee sorter ](https://edgeryders.eu/t/7122) project uses deep learning based image classifiers to relieve small-scale farmers from sorting your coffee by hand.

[Original Post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/were-you-at-the-ai-justice-workshop-on-19-11-share-your-notes-and-thoughts-here/11694/2?u=anon2674660368). 

Thanks so much @anon2674660368 for organizing such an important event on such a crucial topic. For me the most important takeaways for now (as you said, we’ve just started scratching the surface of something so detrimental) are the following:

1. we need to increase tech literacy about the systems in place: if we (individuals, governments, policymakers) don’t know anon1138917760 the black boxes work, anon1138917760 do we know that what they promise us is actually what results they give us. How can we question outcomes if we aren’t informed about the manner in which the systems arrive at conclusions?
2. we also need to understand the tipping point into creating action: when was the last time you really got upset and demanded change? The problem lays again with the fact that we often don’t even know about the injustices (from increased traffic, to the inability to speak to people instead of machines). This topic I think relates to the first point. We can’t be angry to the point of taking action (protests, etc), if we don’t even realize/understand where the injustice is coming from. Side note: we may even want to take it further: should we use certain systems if we don’t know anon1138917760 they work?
3. If actors say they need certain systems, we need to ask them why. Why not do it by hand? The idea is that these systems will solve everything, but they are just accelerating broken systems.

[Original Post](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-i-learned-on-regulating-ai-and-a-human-centric-internet/11699)

In general,  **the group felt the need to spend anon2298377336 some time to get a grip on a shared idea of what AI actually is** , and anon1138917760 it works, before he could discuss its regulation. Occasionally, the discussion veered into being anon2298377336 technical, and not everybody could follow it all the time, even if we had an over-representation of computer scientists and digital activists. This is in itself a result: if this crowd struggles to get it, democratic participation is going to be pretty difficult for the general public.

We used [Chatham House rule ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule), so I in what follows I do not attribute statements to anyone in particular.

We kicked off by reminding ourselves that the new von der Leyen Commission has promised to [tackle AI within the first 100 days of taking office](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/blog-post/von-der-leyen-new-commission-take-aim-at-ai-legislation/). Brussels is mostly happy with anon1138917760 the GDPR thing played out, that is by recognizing the EU as the de facto “regulatory superpower”. The AI regulation in the pipeline is expected to have a similar effect to that of GDPR.

**Participants then expressed some concern around the challenges of regulating AI** . For example:

* A directive may be the wrong instrument. The law is good at enshrining principles (“human-centric AI”), but in the tech industry we are seeing  *everyone* , including FAANG, claiming to adhere to the same principles. What we seem to be missing is an accountable process to translate principles into technical choices. For example, elsewhere I have told the story of anon1138917760 the developers of [Scuttlebutt ](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) justified their refusal to give their users multiple-device accounts in terms of values: “we want to serve the underconnected, and those guys do not own multiple devices. Multiple device account is a first world problem, and should be deprioritized”.
* The AI story is strongly vendor-driven: a solution looking for a problem. Lawmaking as a process is naturally open to the contribution of industry, and this openness risks giving even more market power to the incumbents.
* AI uses big data and lots of computing power, so it tends to live in the cloud as infrastructure. But the cloud is itself super-concentrated, it is infrastructure in few private hands. The rise of AI brings even more momentum to the concentration process. This brings us back to an intuition that has been circulating in this forum, namely that you need antitrust policy to do tech policy, at least in the current situation.
* The term “AI” has come to mean “machine learning on big data”. The governance of the data themselves is an unsolved problem, with major consequences for AI. In the health sector, for example, clinical data tend to be simply entrusted to large companies: the British NHS [gave them](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.co.uk%2F2019%2F09%2F19%2Ffive_nhs_trusts_do_data_deal_with_google_one_says_no%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHAd8EamUp9LY1ulHdC7mufXEXJcQ) to Deep Mind; a [similar operation ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Feuropa.today.it%2Fattualita%2Funa-scelleratezza-consegnare-le-cartelle-cliniche-degli-italiani-all-ibm-rossi-attacca-il-governo.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFKARv42-MfE-a-cJN4t3VXIOvu6g) between the Italian government and IBM Watson was attempted, but failed, because data governance in Italy is with the regions, and they refused to release the data. We learned much about the state of the art of the reflection on data governance at MyData2019: to our surprise [there appears to be a consensus](https://edgeryders.eu/t/10893) among scholars on anon1138917760 to go about data governance, but it is not being translated into law. That work is  *very*  unfinished, and it should be finished  *before*  opening the AI can of worms.
* AI has a large carbon footprint. Even when it does improve on actual human problems, it does so at the cost of worsening the climate, not in a win-win scenario.
* The Internet should be “human-centric”. But machine learning is basically statistical analysis: high-dimensional multivariate statistical models. When it is done on humans, its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you  *you* , gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract “typical humans” or “target groups” or whatever.

As a result of this situation,  **the group was not even in agreement that AI is worth the trouble and the money that it costs** . Two participants argued the opposite sides, both, interestingly, using examples from medicine. The AI-enthusiast noted that AI is getting good at diagnosing medical conditions. The AI-sceptic noted that medicine is not diagnosis-centric, but prognosis-centric; it has no value if it does not improve human life. And the prognosis must always be negotiated with the patient. IT in medicine has historically cheapened the relationship between patient and healer, with the latter ""classifying "" the former in terms of a standard data structure for entry into a database.

Somebody quoted recent studies on the use of AI in medicine. The state of the art is:

* Diagnostic AI does not perform significantly better than human pathologists. ([Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30123-2/fulltext), [Ar.xiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07372))
* Few studies do any external validation of results. Additionally, deep learning models are poorly reported. ([Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30123-2/fulltext))
* Incorrect models bias (and therefore deteriorate) the work of human pathologists ([Nature ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0300-7), [Ar.xiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07372))
* There are risks that AI will be used to erode the doctor-patient relationship ([Nature ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0300-7))

Based on this, the participant argued that at the moment there is no use case for AI in medicine.

*Image credit: [XKCD ](https://xkcd.com/)*

We agreed that not just AI, but all optimization tools are problematic, because they have to make the choice of what, exactly, gets optimized. What tends to get optimized is what the entity deploying the model wants. Traffic is a good example: apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road? Airport layout is designed to maximize pre-flight spending: after you clear security, the only way to the gate goes through a very large duty free shop. This is “optimal”, but not necessary optimal  *for you* .

We next moved to  **data governance** . Data are, of course, AI’s raw material, and only those who have access to data can deploy AI models. A researcher called [Paul Oliver Dehaye](https://paulolivier.dehaye.org/stories/about.html) wants to model discrimination of certain workers. Do do this, he needs to pool the personal data from different individuals into what is called a “data trust”. Data trusts are one of several models for data governance being floated about; the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu/what-decode)’s data commons are another.

In this discussion, even the GDPR’s success appears to have some cracks. For example, Uber is using it to refuse it to give drivers their data, claiming that would impact the riders’ privacy. A participant claimed that the GDPR has a blind spot in that it has nothing to say about standards for data portability. U.S. tech companies have a project called Data Transfer, where they are dreaming up those standards, and doing so in a way that will benefit them most (again). Pragmatically, she thought the EU should set its own standards for this.

We ended with some  **constructive suggestions** . One concerned data governance itself. as noted above, the MyData community and other actors in the tech policy space have made substantial intellectual progress on data governance. Were this progress to be enshrined into EU legislation and standards setting, this would maybe help mitigate the potential of the AI industry to worsen inequalities. For example, saying “everyone has a right to own their data” is not precise enough. It makes a huge difference whether personal data are considered to be a freehold commodity or an unalienable human right. In the former case, people can sell their data to whomever they want: data would thus be like material possessions. In this case, market forces are likely to concentrate their ownership in few hands, because data are much more valuable when aggregated in humongous piles of big data. But in the latter case, data are like the right to freedom. I have it, but I am not allowed to sell myself into slavery. In this scenario, data ownership does not concentrate.

Another constructive suggestions concerned enabling a next-generation eIDAS, to allow for “disposable online identities”. These are pairs of cryptographic keys that you would use for the purpose of accessing a service: instead of sanon1138917760ing your ID to the supermarket cashier when you buy alcoholic drinks, you would sanon1138917760 them a statement digitally signed by the registrar that says more or less “the owner of this key pair is over 18”, and then sign it with your private key. This way, the supermarket knows you are over 18, but does not who you are. It does have your public key, but you can also never use that key pair anymore – that’s what makes it disposable.

Further suggestions included legislating on mandatory auditability of algorithms (there is even a NGO doing work on this, [AlgorithmWatch](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/)), investments in early data literacy in education, and designing for cultural differences: Europeans care more about privacy, whereas many people in Asia are relatively uninterested in it.

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> Fabrizio </h3>

In order to move ahead and to make the most of all ideas and human resources working these days on AI, we need both to understand where potential mobilization is taking place or it might take place, and to have a conceptual framework to move ahead. 
	•	Since AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects …  the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to
	•	assess current uses of AI, 
	•	mobilize people both “against” bad uses and “for” good uses”
	•	design, experiment and revise alternative “good” uses
	•	Sen’s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider “good” all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one’s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, …)
	•	This approach does not incapsulate what is “bad” or “harmful” in a rigid box, but it calls for a participatory/societal assessment of anon1138917760 the general principle should be implemented, an assessment that can be continuously updated through public debate
	•	Not so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of “just”/”unjust”  fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US
	•	Which reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:
	•	In the judiciary
	•	In working councils
	•	In town councils a la Barcelona
	•	Mixing dialogical/analogical debate

Which are the potential ACTORS of mobilization?
	•	Organised Labour: automation, bad jobs, gig economy, low wages
	•	Women: AI machism
	•	Kids: sexual abuses, porno 
	•	Citizens: mobility
	•	Citizens: health … a dimension of life where people are becoming awareof bad uses (insurance, use of DNA)

Therefore, one should move forward according to the following sequence:
	•	Identify, country by country or even places by places, where people’s concern on bad uses (or on forgone good uses) is high and there it is being organised: i.e. where there is a potential demand for “competence support”, both at conceptual and technological level
	•	Concentrate on these contexts and provide them with the conceptual framework
	•	Turn the “pars destruens” into a “pars costruens”
	•	Building at EU level a network that allows horizontal comparison for the same issues both of threats, actions and results
	•	Ensuring at EU level the availability of a competence centre that deals (not necessarily solve, but ai least identify and tackles) with the meta-obstacles preventing the implementation or curtailing the survival of“good” uses.
Complementary activities that emerged from debate:
	•	Following the “substantial freedom” framework a code of behaviour should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them -  should ask themselves: What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?
	•	Analogic/dialogic …. Online/Offline Experimenting platforms combining the two is a priority. In particular, it should be a practice for public administrations and politicians to create dialogic platforms where the above code of behaviour is checked. 
	•	Education/sensibilization on the implementation of the above conceptual framework in order to identify good/bad uses is a priority. It should first of all engage kids from a very early age: a new saga of cautionary tales … would help.

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> Overview of all 10 Stories: Generic audience </h3>

Experts working at the cutting edge of tech, policy and human rights spaces call for greater consideration to be given to the way that AI is altering the very fabric of society. Both academics and policy makers agree that current AI systems risk amplifying existing human biases that entrench inequality - not least because of the widespread, and misguided, perception that data is inherently neutral. Systems for the reporting of sexual assault, for example, are encoded with developers’ assumptions about sexual violence which do not grasp the complexity of victims’ experiences. Those working and researching in the field caution that AI systems are only as unbiased as the humans who build them, and that continuing to give AI undue weight will cause serious harm to the most vulnerable in society.

Across medicine, law, entrepreneurship and gender studies, concern is growing that the pressure to innovate for its own sake comes at great risk to privacy, protection and human rights. Experts caution that companies in both the public and private sectors are rushing to implement technology they don’t fully understand, and that it is crucial due care and consideration is taken when building these systems to ensure they are value-driven and accountable. Unchecked digitisation in the fields of medicine, social work and the reporting of sexual assault fails to recognise human needs which are more nuanced, individualised and unpredictable than AI can fathom. It is critical we ensure that AI is designed and used in such a way that it serves society’s needs – not the other way around.

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> The rush to implement AI too widely and simplistically could have disastrous consequences </h3>

#### <h4 id=""heading--1""> A conversation with Marco Manca </h4>

Marco Manca is an interdisciplinary researcher in mathematics and informational systems with an educational background in medicine. He founded the [SCimPulse Foundation](http://www.scimpulse.org/about-us/), which he still directs, and is also part of several scientific organisations and commissions, including the working group of NATO for human control over auanon3386180186omous systems.

Marko feels there is a lot of excitement about AI and a push to accelerate its implementation widely - but that it is crucial we consider AI a “nifty tool” to use with awareness, rather than an impeccable “leader” that must not be questioned. AI systems are only as good as the data inputted and the questions asked of them by humans. This means that the conclusions returned are not free of human biases, but rather potentially amplify them. Essentially, as they are used now, AI systems simply return the same results as humans would, just “faster and dumber.”

This is a concern because of the rush to implement AI, particularly in the field of medicine. In medicine there is an expectation of precision, but with so many biological variables, the more precise you get the more you diverge, so large scale information potentially becomes less valuable. For example, in the 1970s, various tools were introduced to help doctors predict the likelihood of certain diseases, but attempts to refine these profiles over the years have hit a barrier. Just as you could play a lottery with 1/1000 odds every day for a thousand days and still not win, there is a crucial difference between “the destiny of the person in front of you right now, the destiny of every similar person.”

His argument is not that we should not be developing AI, but that we must consider anon1138917760 we develop and implement it and anon1138917760 we contextualize the information it gives us. If we simply scale up the information we work with now without being informed about the risks, we risk causing serious damage.

### <h3 id=""heading--1"">AI is changing the fabric of society - it is crucial to ensure it serves people, not the other way around. </h3>

#### <h4 id=""heading--1""> A conversation with Seda F. Gürses </h4>

With an undergrad degree in international relations and mathematics, Seda is now an academic at Delft University, focussing on anon1138917760 to do computer science differently - utilising a interdisciplinary approach to explore both concepts of privacy and surveillance, and also looking at what communities need. They were led into this field of study by their fascination with the politics of mathematics and the biases contained within seemingly neutral numbers.

The technological landscape has changed enormously in the past few years — from static software saved on a disk that was only updated every once in a while, to software and apps that are held on services and so constantly updated and optimised. A whole new host of privacy and security issues have arisen, and thus the need for a computer science which secures and protects the needs of its users.

The negative consequences of prioritising optimisation over user experience can be seen in Google Maps and Way, which sends users down service roads to avoid freeway traffic. They don’t care that this has an adverse impact on the environment and local communities, or even that it actually causes congestion in smaller roads. Further, Uber has optimised its system to outsource risk to its workers: instead of paying people for the time they work, Uber offers them a system that tells them when they are most likely to get customers so that they can manage their individual risk.

When this kind of tech injustice is applied to public institutions such as borders and social welfare systems, the discrimination embedded in the very systems mean we are changing the fabric of society without having the necessary discussions as to whether that’s something we want to do. We need to stop talking about data and algorithms and focus on the forms of government we want these technologies to have. It is crucial that the computational infrastructure boosted by AI serves people, not the other way around.

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> Tech is not the simple solution to complex social situations.</h3>

#### <h4 id=""heading--1""> A conversation with Peter Bihr </h4>

Pbihir co-founded ThingsCon community which advocates for a responsible, human-centric approach to the Internet of Things. Smart Cities, where the digital and physical meet and where algorithms actively impact our daily lives, is an important focal point of his work.

He proposes reframing the Smart City discourse (currently dominated by vendors of Smart City tech) away from the technology and more towards a focus on societal impact. What better urban metrics can we apply to cities increasingly governed or shaped by algorithms? Such an analytical framework would be the key to unlocking a real, meaningful debate. Smart City policies must be built around citizen/digital, human rights, and with emphasis on participatory processes, transparency and accountability.

At the most recent ThingsCon conference, Manon den Dunnen shared her experience of unintended horrific consequences of tech going wrong when police officers take phone numbers of both victims and suspects, and then Facebook algorithms then suggest one another as friends.

Further, several studies have sanon1138917760n policing and/or justice related algorithms were found to have racist data points (including some deemed illegal by courts yet remained in the data sets). And the policing algorithm in NYC measures effectiveness by such simplistic metrics that created incentive for officers to report selectively (for example, the systemic intimidation of rape victims to change their charge from rape to a more minor offence).

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> Unchecked digital expansion could entrench existing biases and power inequality. </h3>

#### <h4 id=""heading--1""> A conversation with Corinne Cath-Speth </h4>

With a background in human rights and policy, Corinne Cath-Speth worked as a policy officer for a human rights NGO in London before coming to the Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan Turing Institute to pursue her PhD. Her research focuses on human rights advocacy efforts within Internet governance, with a broader interest of anon1138917760 human rights NGOs are responding to the new (and old) challenges raised by emerging technologies.

In working with human rights activists, anon3175955029 saw that digital technologies - like social media - can give the plight of activists more visibility, but that often these same technologies entrench existing power inequalities and biases. She became interested in studying what happens when activists try to change the infrastructure of the internet itself, rather than simply use it. A number of well-known human rights organizations like the ACLU and EFF, actively do so by contributing to Internet governance fora. She found that these organizations are welcome and can operate in these spaces with relative ease, given their open and multistakeholder nature. At the same time, she also saw that while getting the tech “right” is an important part of the puzzle of human rights advocacy in the digital age, it is also a narrow frame through which to understand the broad spectrum of social concerns raised by networked technologies.

anon3175955029’s work in Internet governance also led her to consider human rights advocacy in AI governance, as AI systems are raising a host of questions regarding privacy, safety, anti-discrimination and other human rights. One of the problems with developing AI advocacy programs is that many of these systems are developed by private companies, so it is difficult to gain access to their technology to examine and understand it. Many NGOs are therefore calling for the regulation of AI systems, but are facing pushback, with companies arguing that it hampers innovation. Yet, it is this same “innovation” that encourages many governments to deploy AI systems. A drive for “innovation” for innovation’s sake is particularly concerning when it encourages governments to step into technologies that they don’t fully understand or even need.

Obviously, a lot of human rights NGOs have been worried about these various dynamics for a while and are consistently raising their concerns— sometimes by bringing in academic work to sanon1138917760 some of these issues. Human Rights Watch, for example, has a great program as does Amnesty International, Privacy International and Article 19. Several of the largest human rights NGOs are focusing on issues of AI systems and bias. But they’re also forced to play whack-a-mole as the application of AI systems becomes more common. How to focus your resources? Which companies and applications are most concerning? Which solutions most tractable and comprehensive? Do we need sectoral guidelines, or do we need guidelines which focus on impact? Do we need self-regulatory ethics frameworks or hard data protection frameworks? All of the above? These are the issues I see a lot of NGOs grapple with and are questions I hope to discuss with you on this platform.

Justin Nogarede works for the Foundation for European Progressive Studies, was previously at the European Commission focussing on competition law and European regulations.

As a trainee in the application law unit at the European Commission, he became aware of the issues involved in ensuring member states comply with EU law, finding that often there isn’t the staff or resources available to enforce directives - for example, the directive on data protection has existed since 1995, but was not widely enforced. Justin now focuses more on data governance, and is finding that as new digital infrastructures are rolled out, they are driven by narrow efficiency concerns and are not accountable. Looking into these new infrastructures is a great opportunity to make the system more participatory and accountable - but we have to take it.

Feeding existing data into AI systems can create problems - for example, when predictive policing has been sanon1138917760n to drive more officers into wealthy areas, as data sanon1138917760s a higher rate of arrests in those areas. Data therefore creates a self-reinforcing loop. Further, digital systems often rely on a binary logic, which healthcare and social problems simply don’t fit. The key problem is that data is a simplification of the real world. Further, some AI systems may support a conservative bias, such as when they are used to predict which offenders are most likely to reoffend.

Regulation of digital infrastructure would be a step in the right direction, and the argument that it would stifle innovation is weak - technological advances must make sense and make lives better. It may not be possible to have 100% compliance, but more involvement of public authorities (even at local level) would be a good step, as would more transparency over anon1138917760 these technologies function. Why is all this innovation not channelled into ways for people to live a better life?

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> Distributed systems promise great possibilities - and challenges.</h3>

#### <h4 id=""heading--1""> A conversation with Hugi Asgeirsson </h4>

Earlier this year, Hugi was in Berlin for the Data Terra Nemo conference, focussing on decentralised web applications which are hosted without traditional servers, allowing for a lot of interesting applications.

They were inspired by the human-centric community that has grown up around ‘gossip’ protocols like Scuttlebutt. It seems to be forming a playground where new and radical ideas can be tested and implemented. The original developer of Scuttlebutt, Dominic Tarr, describes his MO as: “not to build the next big thing, but rather to build the thing that inspires the next big thing, that way you don’t have to maintain it” and this seems to have set the anon3386180186e for Scuttlebutt itself.

One of the core elements of Scuttlebutt is that users can host data for other people on the network without being directly connected to them. This has the positive effect that users in countries where internet usage is highly restricted can connect via other users - though on the other hand, this also means that users could unwittingly be hosting information they would rather not propagate. There have been instances of the Norwegian alt-right using Scuttlebutt to communicate. Scuttlebutt has been working to address this issue but solutions are imperfect so far.

The bottom line is that distributed systems such as Scuttlebutt are both democratising and empowering and they come with a whole new set of possibilities and challenges.

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> Open-source technology and interoperability are key to sustainable innovation </h3>

#### <h4 id=""heading--1""> A conversation with Oliver Sauter </h4>

There is an accepted “law” of entrepreneurship: in order to build something valuable, you have to be ten times better than what already exists (as proven by Google + which arguably had better some better features than Facebook but failed to tempt people away). Why does this law exist and what can we do to change it?

BlackforestBoi believes it comes down to: Costs to switch (time and mental effort) > additional benefit offered *~10. Such growth requirement has produced some great leaps in innovation - but these come with downsides. How would the world look if we focused more on incremental innovations?

What is holding us back? The way companies make money for one: the 2nd quarter of 2018, Facebook lost $120bn (billion!) in stock value within 48 hours, the biggest loss of any company in history. The reason: It posted the least growth since its founding, while still making 5BN in profits the same quarter and growing by 42% since the last year. Secondly data and social lock ins creates counter incentives for interoperable formats which would make it easier for users to migrate between services or integrate them,

Breaking this dynamic would require tackling the problem from multiple angles: namely allowing users to move freely between services, creating economic models that reward quality of service rather than simple growth, and ideally adopting Open-Source software to allow companies to build on one another’s work.

WorldBrain (dot) io is building open-source software in an attempt to enable incremental innovation, the foundation of which is Memex - an open-source privacy tool. Interoperability is baked deep into the core of Memex, it is fully open-source and WorldBrain (dot) io has no stock value, so is entirely focussed on building a sustainable service.

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> Civic organisations are key to turning AI technology into a force for civil justice </h3>

#### <h4 id=""heading--1""> A conversation with Fabrizio Barca </h4>

With a varied background in banking and treasury and more recently inequalities and justice, Fabrizio previously worked at the EU and now with a civic organisation called the Forum for Inequality and Diversity.

The current crisis in Western countries is driven by inequality - in particular the paradox that we have the technology to create equality but instead it is producing an unprecedented concentration of knowledge and power in very few hands. This must be addressed by putting political pressure on the issues. State-owned enterprises and collective platforms where people can put together data that everyone has access to could turn these technologies into forces for social justice.

A one-size-fits all approach to AI in public administration grows resentment. It deprives people of the most important thing - human connection and a sense of being recognised - which breeds intolerance, division and a loss of trust in democracy. Fabrizio is just coming to understand anon1138917760 effective civic organisations can be, not just in advocacy work but in taking action to shape services in local areas. He hopes to gain even more understanding through discussing the topics with a mix of people from different backgrounds.

### <h3 id=""heading--1""> Digital spaces currently failing to protect women and victims of sexual violence </h3>

#### <h4 id=""heading--1""> A conversation with Kate J Sim</h3>

A PhD researcher at Oxford Internet Institute, anon2474722476 studies the intersection of gender-based violence and emerging technologies. Her work focuses on issues of trust, gender and sexual politics, and the double-edged role of technology in facilitating connections but also targeted harassment. While organising against campus violence she personally experienced cyberharassment and lack of support from law enforcement. More resources have become available since then, but we need to change anon1138917760 we conceptualise these issues and fundamentally change the design of the platforms.

She helped to form a cross-campus network that grew to a nonprofit organisation, Know Your IX. The space requires better structures in place to support mental health and protection from cyberharassment to reduce burnout. Research sanon1138917760s again and again that women, especially women of colour, tend to self-censor and reduce their visibility in order to survive - it is crucial we put more safeguarding in place to protect them.

Digital systems designed to facilitate disclosures, collect evidence and automate reporting of sexual assault are attractive to institutions because of their efficiency - and to some extent to victims as they are perceived to be objective and neutral. However, these systems have bias encoded in them. The designers are working with their own understanding of sexual violence, which may not match victims’ experiences. Some victims don’t have the data literacy or English level to work the systems, which could compound their trauma. Further, the pressure to report is encoded into the design of these systems, but this is a misguided emphasis on a single optimal solution, which is not appropriate for all victims. De-emphasising reporting and focussing on “small data” driven by relationship building can create a structured conversation which is rich, insightful and telling.

Rather than asking anon1138917760 tech can be fixed for the better, the more urgent and important question is: who and what are we overlooking when we turn to tech solutions? How can we support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over anon1138917760 they interpret and act on data?

### <h3 id=""heading--1"">Focus on scalar indicators is driven by need to describe reality, not change it. </h3>

#### <h4 id=""heading--1""> A conversation with Alberto Cottica </h4>

Alberto had been hoping that ehnography-at-scale via SSNA could integrate, if not replace, the indicator paradigm, but after trying to get people to assess their own willingness to pay for, say, avoiding the extinction of some type of frog in Madagascar, or lowering the PM10 content by 10%, he found convincing evidence that we could never trust our results

He refers to James Scott’s convincing argument for scalar indicators being propelled by the modernist ideology that underpin the coalescing of modern states. This works for states but not so much for people. Modern states have created a demand for scalar indicators, but this has more to do with their thirst for administrative order than with a drive to understand what is really going on.

The individual needs vs individual capabilities, and the collective needs and capacities. One person may be fooled by a system, like cambridge analytica.

Elections, Cambridge analytica, Facebook

Algorithms like Facebook are pulling us into a certain bias. Gathering data and classifying a person based on a lot of data around.

If myself am less biased the algorithms are less likely to classify me.

Technology leads to bad or good results: Principle of social justice

Amartya Sen’s principle of substantial freedom, a sustainable substantial freedom. We need to have capacity/capability to live the life we want

As worker, I want it to help me to avoid discrimination in subjective interviews, but not to be used to have AI discriminating against me because of previous behavior of “my” group

My freedom should be enhanced

Putting on the table simple methodology that allows us to understand the just and the unjust

This kind of principle is not the one we take out, it’s a methodology, an open-ended principle - it can be filled with content, case by case only through the participatory mechanism.

Different subjective values of different contexts can lead to conflict- case by case through participatory processes is the solution - not just regulation

We slowly develop what we consider to be just

**What is something you are struggling with? What is out there to make our own biases less visible to the algorithms?**


**How can we get emotionally engaged into the ai discussion? What do you want to push against? Where are injustices related coming out of this?**

Use of AI in judicial and social welfare, like in housing projects who gets a house, based on an algorithm. But people need to have someone recognize them as a human people, But we aren’t recognized as human beings anymore, discrimination grows because the human to human contact is no longer there. But the problem is that is that there are sooo many more things happening that are not implicit. The way labor was exploited in capitalism, enormous change happened. But now this is being copied again. But it isn’t causing an enormous reaction. The unions are weak.

Credit for a household going to banks. Information about our behaviour. Families are asked a high rate, the reduction of social justice. Where does the right-wing voter come from? There is a big job of just making clear what is happening. What happened in the State was evident, but here we lack information, children should understand.

We need to:

Educate, anon1138917760 for bad and for good it can used
Judiciary needs to be brought into the game
We need to bring back people’s wellbeing into it.
It isn’t necessarily about tech, it’s about people. The solution isn’t marketization.


**in terms of mobilization and justice, perception of the actions and reactions of justice. We’ve seen the same thing playing out in different places for different reasons. Obvious injustice - the link between the situation and the AI land where this is scaled up. What happens when it scales up?**

labor, women, kids, citizens, consumers. It can react to a machine, but it is also a reaction to social issues, national bargaining in negotiation of algorithms. People are coming together against the gig economy. The platform is private, its proprietary, they are angry. They know there is misuse.

In the US, if you read the amount of literature by women on gender, there’s an abundance, but within the EU this is not the case.

With regards to kids’ privacy, their are flashes of anger, but no movements.

With users of mobility services, there is some action from citizens. For example in Milan they are now trying to launch a platform for mobility.

On anger, you always have to have a structure. Otherwise it may be used by the wrong people or die out.

Social justice: is this algorithm being used to enhance or reduce the capabilities of humans. On all the different fields.

Putting the structure on the anger. You need to turn it into a request.

We’re not talking enough about the consequences. I personally do not feel threatened to automation, but many people are. I don’t believe in any of the numbers that go about. What is really happening is the quality of jobs with reflection on people’s lives, relations, the capacity of algorithms…people are being told one day to another if they will work. This is killing their lives. The unions - representing labor, have a reason to mobilize people. If you are looking for a bomb shell I would study them more, the role of people like us. The unions are not equipped these days, we were told they are not necessary anymore, sometimes conservative. I would invest in capacitation of the union.

 it’s like the amazon example, they weren’t unionized, but they protested and had demands and got them, and unionized after. But I am stressing that labor is a large area where things come along.


**Why are we putting the wellbeing of people behind proprietary systems?**



**If actors say they need algorithms: why?**




**What are the reasons people are unable to act upon algorithmic issues in society?** 




**Where is the space in which humans can have agency?** 

The three steps: let them pay taxes; mobility of capital

We are discussing this within these constraints, because we can’t change the whole world, but if there’s some solidarity between the unions — organised labor, if we can give them higher capacity, and then they won’t let them be abused, it is doable. They are very weak technological speaking, there is no negotiation anymore.


**We have a lot of things like roads with are public, you can’t make a private road and make it public. But for some reason, we don’t have the same idea about data, and why not?**

if you perceive the data is being used out of control then you are boycotting it. The results of systematic mistakes, decisions have been taken by the private corporations and when the public sector is using them it is doing for its own purposes. Talking about the problem that is not in algorithm but our pressure is taken out of context, the common discourse has taken the public sector out. Even the illusion of internet as being something out of the control of the state. The state has been wrongly used. Even in the education - the teachers in Italy weren’t given explanations why they are being placed somewhere. But this is not because of the data. The algorithm was badly used.


**Why are we buying into these systems and who hold the power?**

*his own notes from the event:*

In order to move ahead and to make the most of all ideas and human resources working these days on AI, we need both to understand where potential mobilization is taking place or it might take place, and to have a conceptual framework to move ahead.

* Since AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects … the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to
* assess current uses of AI,
* mobilize people both “against” bad uses and “for” good uses”
* design, experiment and revise alternative “good” uses
* Sen’s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider “good” all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one’s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, …)
* This approach does not incapsulate what is “bad” or “harmful” in a rigid box, but it calls for a participatory/societal assessment of anon1138917760 the general principle should be implemented, an assessment that can be continuously updated through public debate
* Not so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of “just”/”unjust” fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US
* Which reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:
* In the judiciary
* In working councils
* In town councils a la Barcelona
* Mixing dialogical/analogical debate

Which are the potential ACTORS of mobilization?

* **Organised Labour**  : automation, bad jobs, gig economy, low wages
* Women: AI machism
* Kids: sexual abuses, porno
* Citizens: mobility
* Citizens: health … a dimension of life where people are becoming awareof bad uses (insurance, use of DNA)

Therefore, one should move forward according to the following sequence:

* Identify, country by country or even places by places, where people’s concern on bad uses (or on forgone good uses) is high and there it is being organised: i.e. where there is a potential demand for “competence support”, both at conceptual and technological level
* Concentrate on these contexts and provide them with the conceptual framework
* Turn the “pars destruens” into a “pars costruens”
* Building at EU level a network that allows horizontal comparison for the same issues both of threats, actions and results
* Ensuring at EU level the availability of a competence centre that deals (not necessarily solve, but ai least identify and tackles) with the meta-obstacles preventing the implementation or curtailing the survival of“good” uses.

Complementary activities that emerged from debate:

* Following the “substantial freedom” framework a  **code of behaviour**  should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them - should ask themselves:  **What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?**
* Analogic/dialogic …. Online/Offline  **Experimenting platforms**  combining the two is a priority. In particular, it should be a practice for public administrations and politicians to create dialogic platforms where the above code of behaviour is checked.
* Education/sensibilization on the implementation of the above conceptual framework in order to identify good/bad uses is a priority. It should first of all engage kids from a very early age: a new saga of cautionary tales … would help."

We are trying to understand new systems and optimization of their functions. What happens when the system causes externalities? optimization systems make population wide decisions.

I’m more into that if we know what is wrong anon1138917760 we can mobilize people and now we are about what is the thing that we are mobilizing about.

A lot of the time when people are faced with systematic conversation or binary boxing in for example: Employment models aren’t working, you can’t break out of those and you have to work with others these new ideas to making it work.

You can only break through these models and narratives by working together and creating new narratives.

When we know what we want to do and where to go, we can create a new future, something completely different from what the AI is predicting perhaps. Thus create the space that is more free.

Participatory art - the art that throws away the separation between art and the spectator. Because of the consumerist society…the point is not to create “great art” but great transformative experience together with other people. Example of the Borderland.

I agree with the antitrust principle. What we consider AI is machine learning, this is the root of our problems, it’s just classical statistics. You create the illusion that value production is shifted to the generation…. ex. if the doctor establish a relation with the patient, the AI has not to invade the relation, but now the doctor has to take notes and patient see less value in it (you look somewhere else and you are centralised…).

Airport before and after Ryanair: before architecture were associated to functions and your experience of travels, room for different functions. Now with the low cost you consider that the experience is less valuable, now is a shopping mall and at the gate it’s temporarily informations about space.

medicine is not diagnosis, but prognosis-based. In medicine, nothing has value if I cannot improve your life. A patient can and should negotiate with the doctor where to go from here; he or she even has a right to die. This is a very poor fit for anon1138917760 ML-on-big-data works.

In Belgium there is a company called It’sMe, who does online identity. They are pushing their data onto Azure, making it GDPR and EIDAS compliant. That changed my thinking, because it sanon1138917760ed me as even these sterling silver pieces of European thinking ends up in the Silicon Valley cloud.
We need to break the number-person relationship: when you get born, you receive a number from the state, and the game’s up. I dream of disposable identities, that we set up with the purpose of entering into a relationship, like for example receiving a service. A good analogy is one-time email addresses: you get an email address, you sign up to some online service with it, use it ONCE to receive the email to confirm you do control that email, and then it self destructs.



**What should the EU do practically?**

Governance instead of government. Here’s my take: the kind of society you are looking at is anarcho-communist. The communist part is that infrastructure is fully centralized, like in the 30 glorieuse. Anything that runs onto the infrastructure is fully permissionless. That’s the anarchist part. And finally, the data stays with the people.

Why are we pushing for AI? The end of Moore’s law. The money we seek in are more unlike to come back. Industry took a risk at specialised chips: AI and blockchain-specific. So, now they need to create a demand for these chips. We should be aware of the vendor-driven nature of this stuff, and think about anon1138917760 to regulate these companies.

The business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That’s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.

**Can we think of counterproductive regulation on the Internet? Stuff like the copyright directive? anon1138917760 did we end up with all these things, that used to be a public good, end up being someone’s property?**

We optimize relationships. This is problematic. For example, we have marketing companies working with civil liberties organizations, that tell their clients: we can tell you which of your donors care about which issues, so you can optimize for issues where you get more money.

Optimisation has been the logic as far, but it can go wrong anyway. Traffic is a perfect example. If you look at optimization system, it comes at a cost and if you don’t do internalise the cost it causes bigger damages. Apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road?

SEDA on feedbacks: I know GDPR, it’s regulated anyway. There are serious problems on anon1138917760 GDPR focuses on personal data on individuals.
We talk about automated decisions, but there is a set of criteria … the optimization is not about the single person, but as pbe part of a certain group which operates certain choices in general. So, you expect to empower people, but actually you don’t. Paul Olivier Dehaye is trying to pool data from different workers to see if people are being discriminated. This is called a “data trust”. There is also the DECODE project that is doing something they called “data commons”.

We are now in a mess with the GDPR. Uber, for example, uses it to refuse to give drivers their data, saying this impacts the rights of the riders. This (says Seda) is the consequence of focusing on personal rights when the data are used to optimize over populations.

I’m a bit skeptical that legislation is the right instrument to do this kind of things. It’s a blunt instrument, because as of now there is no good understanding of the process from the ethical values (fairly easy to encode in a directive) to the actual technical choices of the scientists and engineers building AI systems. Ex. we like the New Zealand group developing Scuttlebutt: when users asked for cross-device accounts, the core developer replied “I’m not doing that, because we want to serve underprivileged people, and these people do not have multiple devices”. What he was doing was justifying his technical choices in terms of his values. As a socio-technical culture, we are not good at that.



**What is “investment in AI”? What should the EU do practically?**

climate + competition policy = nobody is allowed to grow to much. What is “empowering”? I suspect that AI (ML applied on big data) is inherently NOT human-centric, because its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you you, gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract “typical humans” or “target groups” or whatever.

I participated in the recent NGI Forward [workshop on Inequalities in the age of AI](/t/10326) organized by Edgeryders. I was part of the discussion on scenarios for the regulation of AI, moderated by Justin Nogarede. The format was unusual, at least for me: a [fishbowl discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)) with four invited guests acting as icebreakers. These were **Marco Manca** @anon3513118528  (Member of Nato's Working group on Meaningful Human Control over AI-based systems); **Seda Gürses** @anon2133014450  (Department of Multi-Actor Systems at TU Delft); Justin @anon1489074103 : and myself. The People in the fishbowl kicked off, but then we melted in the general discussion as others stepped up to make contributions and ask questions. This worked very well, and enabled a lively discussion.

In general, **the group felt the need to spend anon2298377336 some time to get a grip on a shared idea of what AI actually is**, and anon1138917760 it works, before he could discuss its regulation. Occasionally, the discussion veered into being anon2298377336 technical, and not everybody could follow it all the time, even if we had an over-representation of computer scientists and digital activists. This is in itself a result: if this crowd struggles to get it, democratic participation is going to be pretty difficult for the general public. 

We used [Chatham House rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule), so I in what follows I do not attribute statements to anyone in particular. 

We kicked off by reminding ourselves that the new von der Leyen Commission has promised to [tackle AI within the first 100 days of taking office](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/blog-post/von-der-leyen-new-commission-take-aim-at-ai-legislation/). Brussels is mostly happy with anon1138917760 the GDPR thing played out, that is by recognizing the EU as the de facto ""regulatory superpower"". The AI regulation in the pipeline is expected to have a similar effect to that of GDPR.

**Participants then expressed some concern around the challenges of regulating AI**. For example: 

* A  directive may be the wrong instrument. The law is good at enshrining principles (""human-centric AI""), but in the tech industry we are seeing *everyone*, including FAANG, claiming to adhere to the same principles. What we seem to be missing is an accountable process to translate principles into technical choices. For example, elsewhere I have told the story of anon1138917760 the developers of [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) justified their refusal to give their users multiple-device accounts in terms of values: ""we want to serve the underconnected, and those guys do not own multiple devices. Multiple device account is a first world problem, and should be deprioritized"".
* The AI story is strongly vendor-driven: a solution looking for a problem. Lawmaking as a process is naturally open to the contribution of industry, and this openness risks giving even more market power to the incumbents.
* AI uses big data and lots of computing power, so it tends to live in the cloud as infrastructure. But the cloud is itself super-concentrated, it is infrastructure in few private hands. The rise of AI brings even more momentum to the concentration process. This brings us back to an intuition that has been circulating in this forum, namely that [you need antitrust policy to do tech policy](t/10868/2), at least in the current situation. 
* The term ""AI"" has come to mean ""machine learning on big data"". The governance of the data themselves is an unsolved problem, with major consequences for AI. In the health sector, for example, clinical data tend to be simply entrusted to large companies: the British NHS [gave them](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.co.uk%2F2019%2F09%2F19%2Ffive_nhs_trusts_do_data_deal_with_google_one_says_no%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHAd8EamUp9LY1ulHdC7mufXEXJcQ) to Deep Mind; a [similar operation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Feuropa.today.it%2Fattualita%2Funa-scelleratezza-consegnare-le-cartelle-cliniche-degli-italiani-all-ibm-rossi-attacca-il-governo.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFKARv42-MfE-a-cJN4t3VXIOvu6g) between the Italian government and IBM Watson was attempted, but failed, because data governance in Italy is with the regions, and they refused to release the data. We learned much about the state of the art of the reflection on data governance at MyData2019: to our surprise [there appears to be a consensus](/t/10893) among scholars on anon1138917760 to go about data governance, but it is not being translated into law. That work is *very* unfinished, and it should be finished *before* opening the AI can of worms.
* AI has a large carbon footprint. Even when it does improve on actual human problems, it does so at the cost of worsening the climate, not in a win-win scenario. 
* The Internet should be ""human-centric"". But machine learning is basically statistical analysis: high-dimensional multivariate statistical models. When it is done on humans, its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you *you*, gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract ""typical humans"" or ""target groups"" or whatever. 

As a result of this situation, **the group was not even in agreement that AI is worth the trouble and the money that it costs**. Two participants argued the opposite sides, both, interestingly, using examples from medicine. The AI-enthusiast noted that AI is getting good at diagnosing medical conditions. The AI-sceptic noted that medicine is not diagnosis-centric, but prognosis-centric; it has no value if it does not improve human life. And the prognosis must always be negotiated with the patient. IT in medicine has historically cheapened the relationship between patient and healer, with the latter ""classifying "" the former in terms of a standard data structure for entry into a database. 

Somebody quoted recent studies on the use of AI in medicine. The state of the art is:

* Diagnostic AI does not perform significantly better than human pathologists. ([Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30123-2/fulltext), [Ar.xiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07372))
* Few studies do any external validation of results. Additionally, deep learning models are poorly reported. ([Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30123-2/fulltext)) 
* Incorrect models bias (and therefore deteriorate) the work of human pathologists ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0300-7), [Ar.xiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07372))
* There are risks that AI will be used to erode the doctor-patient relationship ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0300-7))

Based on this, the participant argued that at the moment there is no use case for AI in medicine.

We agreed that not just AI, but all optimization tools are problematic, because they have to make the choice of what, exactly, gets optimized. What tends to get optimized is what the entity deploying the model wants. Traffic is a good example: apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road? Airport layout is designed to maximize pre-flight spending: after you clear security, the only way to the gate goes through a very large duty free shop. This is ""optimal"", but not necessary optimal *for you*. 

We next moved to **data governance**. Data are, of course, AI's raw material, and only those who have access to data can deploy AI models. A researcher called [Paul Oliver Dehaye](https://paulolivier.dehaye.org/stories/about.html) wants to model discrimination of certain workers. Do do this, he needs to pool the personal data from different individuals into what is called a ""data trust"". Data trusts are one of several models for data governance being floated about; the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu/what-decode)'s data commons are another.  

In this discussion, even the GDPR's success appears to have some cracks. For example, Uber is using it to refuse it to give drivers their data, claiming that would impact the riders' privacy. A participant claimed that the GDPR has a blind spot in that it has nothing to say about standards for data portability. U.S. tech companies have a project called Data Transfer, where they are dreaming up those standards, and doing so in a way that will benefit them most (again). Pragmatically, she thought the EU should set its own standards for this.

We ended with some **constructive suggestions**. One concerned data governance itself. as noted above, the MyData community and other actors in the tech policy space have made substantial intellectual progress on data governance. Were this progress to be enshrined into EU legislation and standards setting, this would maybe help mitigate the potential of the AI industry to worsen inequalities. For example, saying ""everyone has a right to own their data"" is not precise enough. It makes a huge difference whether personal data are considered to be a freehold commodity or an unalienable human right. In the former case, people can sell their data to whomever they want: data would thus be like material possessions. In this case, market forces are likely to concentrate their ownership in few hands, because data are much more valuable when aggregated in humongous piles of big data. But in the latter case, data are like the right to freedom. I have it, but I am not allowed to sell myself into slavery. In this scenario, data ownership does not concentrate.

Another constructive suggestions concerned enabling a next-generation eIDAS, to allow for ""disposable online identities"". These are pairs of cryptographic keys that you would use for the purpose of accessing a service: instead of sanon1138917760ing your ID to the supermarket cashier when you buy alcoholic drinks, you would sanon1138917760 them a statement digitally signed by the registrar that says more or less ""the owner of this key pair is over 18"", and then sign it with your private key. This way, the supermarket knows you are over 18, but does not who you are. It does have your public key, but you can also never use that key pair anymore – that's what makes it disposable. 

Further suggestions included legislating on mandatory auditability of algorithms (there is even a NGO doing work on this, [AlgorithmWatch](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/)), investments in early data literacy in education, and designing for cultural differences: Europeans care more about privacy, whereas many people in Asia are relatively uninterested in it."

We got started young, helped by [Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring) & the realization that previous generations had really screwed things up & contemporary generations seemed incapable of fixing things.

Warned by our *""betters""* that we best get in line, we rebelled becoming outcasts. We lived our lives between protesting on the streets & in the woods, self-directed education, escapist activities, freelance art work, extreme sports & running away. The shutting down of the alternative press, the rise of new media & the Internet necessitated new strategies.

Our biggest hurdles involve procuring food & shelter, in both urban & rural environments. We've lost opportunities when identified as being dysfunctional to the dysfunctional system. Institutions do a good job filtering out people like us, we've done best in new programs & usually see the door slammed on our backsides to prevent more like us from entering.

We often find ourselves where none like us have gone before except in dim memory, myth or legend & none may follow for a variety of reasons. Our understanding is that this is the way the system functions to keep us separated from like-minded fellow travelers. The system appears to fear our gathering in groups, so that is what we seek.

**Which doubts do you have about the work you are doing and the path forward?**
We work in the arts, writing fiction & nonfiction, media production & performance; the soft sciences, personal & social psychology; & technology, media production tech support & coding for a networked world. We're now developing & refining a focus on data science, AI, machine learning, & deep learning in several dimensions of sentiment analysis & data mining & data visualization.

Our only doubts lie in judging the efficacy of our work. Clearly we excel in academics & production but we only seem to benefit when found useful & manageable by exploitive agents of BAU. The more our cognitive ability, theory & perception evolve the harder it becomes to find acceptance from gatekeepers.

It seems to us that the path forward lies in the intersection of the work we do, especially in collaboration, which emerges as a requirement. It's not exactly clear what that is. It appears to be like driving an unknown road at night, only able to see what's in the headlights & no further.

**What kind of support would you like to offer others traveling a similar path?**
We prefer being open to what fellow travelers perceive as their needs in the way of support. We do not recommend our particular path to anyone & acknowledge that we may cross paths for unknowable reasons & appreciate input from people we happen to meet. Clearly, we do not know anon1138917760 to deal with this system. We do not know what people need.

We tend to be averse to those who revel in identifying ""enemies"" as we see that impulse emerging from paranoid-schizoid defenses and it only serves the dysfunctional system to divide us. That said, we do understand there are some very damaged & dangerous people out here that seek to exploit all they meet, we've met a few & see many on TV gaining celebrity status. So, perhaps the best we offer is in the way of suggesting tools & techniques useful for growing positive progressive communities."

* to me it reads anon2298377336 ""dark"" and it reads a bit as if you also would describe enemies or obstacles (""the system"", ""sick societies"") yourself.
* I do have the impression that communities and collectives all over the world are forming and getting much stronger and more ""grounded"" (e.g. introspecting the culture that they live and the ideals they try to live by).
* I would not share the image / narrative that something tries to prevent that (people meet and try new stuff) from happening; there are plenty of initiatives trying to keep up with mapping all the projects that are done. Sure, there could be more and better support (and that will always be true). But it is amazing to see all that is happening.
* I also do not really see the ""heroes from myth and legend"" that try hard and then see doors shut behind them from institutions. Its sounds like legend-building to me. Which system tries to keep you away from like-minded fellow travelers? Psychological? Couple dynamics? Neighbourhoods? States? Nation States? Capital itself? Global influencers? ...

The current economic system in America, Chomsky says, is so **dysfunctional** “that it cannot put eager hands to needed work using the resources that would be readily available if the economy were designed to serve human needs rather than wealth beyond the dreams of avarice for a privileged few.”

“The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don’t know anon1138917760 to be submissive, and so on — because they’re **dysfunctional** to the institutions.” Noam Chomsky

https://truthout.org/articles/noam-chomsky-democratic-party-centrism-risks-handing-election-to-trump/

**“And only those who stand outside the failed institutions can lead this effort.” George Monbiot**

**“So, if you don’t fit in, if you feel at odds with the world, if your identity is troubled and frayed, if you feel lost and ashamed – it could be because you have retained the human values you were supposed to have discarded. You are a deviant. Be proud.” George Monbiot**

I posted the event on the platform 2 weeks ago.  Let's try to join forces to make it even better.
It would be lovely to get some volunteers to film the talks and take photos, so materials can be reused.  Do you anyone in Belgium who could support?

Also it would be nice to have the conversation on one single place :slight_smile:

As the conversation is also part of the Anticipate event:

## Anticipate ! Exploring Collective Intelligence Design

[date=2019-11-19 timezone=""Europe/Brussels""] → [date=2019-11-29 timezone=""Europe/Brussels""]

* **Organiser:** @anon796444895 
* **Location:** Saarbruecken, multiple venues
* **Event:** A welcoming, low-threshold, non-nerd workshop series around specific areas of collective intelligence design - data sovereignty, community architectures, and cooperative data governance - to bring people concerned about tech into site-specific co-creation processes to address concrete needs for collaborative solutions. 
* **Languages:** We have multilingual teams and can make a diverse group of people feel at home, but given the local focus of these workshops, most participants will speak German.

Co-hosted by [xm:lab](https://www.xmlab.org/research) - Experimental Media Lab and [K8](http://www.k8.design) of the Academy of Fine Arts Saar. 

The workshop series is part of an ongoing [exploration](http://www.anticipate.network) of collective intelligence design as a way of giving speculation authority to act in the present. Taking placing during the academic year, the workshops are also being integrated into seminars dedicated to ""[Cultures of Open](https://www.hbksaar.de/vorlesungen/details/medientheorie-cultures-of-open)"" and ""[The Art of Decision](https://www.hbksaar.de/vorlesungen/details/medientheorie-die-kunst-der-entscheidung)"".

**Workshop I Data Sovereignty**
[date=2019-11-19 timezone=""Europe/Brbussels""] → [date=2019-11-19 timezone=""Europe/Brussels""]
* **Times:** 10.00 - 15:30
* **Location:** East Side Fab - Halle 11, Eschbergerweg 40, 66121 Saarbrücken

**Theme**: Basic introduction to the ways in which our daily activities generate data flows and the ways in which these may be harnessed to support auanon3386180186omy and self-determination. We will look specifically at health- and workplace-related data, as this data is arguably the most personal, sensitive, and vulnerable to misuse. At the same time, it is precisely because of this that it offers a way to engage with data sovereignty concerns.

**Context**: Developing a holistic approach to data literacy begins with awareness of the many overlapping data-generating contexts we pass through as we live and labor. As far as the bigger picture is concerned, this is it a key step toward co-designing that which affects anon1138917760 we act - collective intelligence design enables deep engagement with the socio-technological infrastructures structuring and sustaining our agency. Workshop in cooperation with [Open Saar e.V.](https://opensaar.de/)

**Workshop II Data Governance and Decentralized Technologies**
[date=2019-11-28 timezone=""Europe/Brussels""] → [date=2019-11-28 timezone=""Europe/Brussels""]
* **Times:** 14:00 - 18:00
* **Location:** K8, Ufergasse 2, 66111 Saarbrücken

**Theme**: New ideas related to data governance have come from communities engaging with blockchain technologies. We will take a look at some of these ideas and bring them together with approaches from the [cooperative](https://www.saluscoop.org/) universe. Workshop II offers in-depth follow-up to Workshop I.

**Context**: Decentralized technologies have become key areas of collective intelligence design [experimentation](http://daostack.io). While some of these efforts have been criticized for reproducing the not-so-open geek cultures of tech research (""blokechain""), these technologies are too important to leave them to the usual techno-libertarian suspects. So we need to find ways to bring more people into a key systems design process.

**Workshop III Community Architectures**
[date=2019-11-29 timezone=""Europe/Brussels""] → [date=2019-11-29 timezone=""Europe/Brussels""]
* **Times:** 10:00 - 16:00
* **Location:** xm:lab, Keplerstr. 3-5, 66117 Saarbrücken / Blida, Metz

**Theme**: How do we bring sustainable architecture / upcycling / renewable energy communities into the design process of a workspace for a new commons-oriented cooperative? We will look at two existing spaces and co-develop a vision for a new space here in Saarbrücken. Following a (remote) walk-through of COACTlab in Barcelona we will visit [Bliiida](https://www.bliiida.fr/) in Metz, France, just across the border.

**Context**: Members of the Academy of Fine Arts Saar have initiated the foundation of a cooperative (s:coop) to actively contribute to a new economy. Locally, this has involved exchanges with various actors from freelancing, innovation, and start-up communities. Now the time has come to develop and design a physical space that can operate as a community architecture. And one way to get started is to look what others have already done.

I have introduced myself shortly here: https://edgeryders.eu/t/anon1138917760-to-balance-the-needs-of-the-individual-and-the-collective-collective-intelligence-and-more/11559

And also talked to Soenke last week, and we happily got a good connection.

I contribute to the area of collective intelligence in several ways as researcher and entrepreneur, and I take a mixed approach of Online and Offline methods and technologies and its combination.

For example:

- As Entrepreneur (and someanon1138917760 artist), at the yearly Build Peace Conference I organize workshops and interactive exhibitions on Co-creation.  You can see 2 photos of the exhibition here: https://marshmallowsg.wixsite.com/buildpeace  (this is a draft website that needs to still be finished)  You see there my daughter and some screens and projections.  We do this together.  She is a Minecraft expert and she supports me to help others with the computers in case it is too much for me when there is too much people.  We do exercises in which we use co-creation of the ideal home place for a person on paper, lego, and also on Minecraft.  We learn to co-draw, co-decide, co-design, co-budget.

- As researcher: I have for example co-written 4 projects to the Nesta call on Collective Intelligence.  I hope that at least one of them gets some budget.  One of the project ideas is about collective decision making tools, and a study of polarization/collaboration.  Another one is related to intergenerational collective decision making.  Another one is about Decentralized/Distributed Governance, and another one about Swarm Human Intelligence.  Probably one of this projects ideas or the combination of all of them could be submitted to a H2020 call on democracy, collective decision making.  We will be looking into this with @anon796444895 

- As a speaker, I work mostly on awareness, sanon1138917760ing to people that we can transform the way we decide and do it collaboratively, also transform our organizations and in general society, for more participation, and horizontal organizations.  Talks vary from TEDx, to other international conferences on Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Peace Movements.  I can give a list of these but will only post the TEDx for now:  https://youtu.be/fqR8OQ1u63Q

I hope to collaborate with more people over here <3
Initially I feel that the collaboration will start with Soenke, probably with a follow up event in Brussels.  Let's see anon1138917760 this unfolds... :slight_smile:

Thanks @anon1199199125 for moving this forward!
@anon2674660368, @anon3529867364, I have had a great talk with @anon796444895, and we would like to have some follow up meetup in Brussels.  I am in Amsterdam at the moment as I am one of the Speakers at the European Women in Tech conference, and for this reason I will not be able to attend the first Anticipate event in Germany.    

How do you recommend us to move forward?  I would like to host it as DigitYser.  And one idea can be to work with Minecraft as I do it with my daughter, for co-creation of the ideal community, on paper, with lego and digitally."

## Fishbowl 1: Featuring Alberto Cottica, Marco Manca, Seda Gurses (with input from Rob) facilitated by Justin Nogarede

### Ad Verbatum Notes from  Ilaria and Alberto
The EU’s new Commission is looking to approve a new AI directive, and of course democratic participation is important to ensure a good law. What do you feel necessary from EU to participate?

Alberto: I’m a bit skeptical that legislation is the right instrument to do this kind of things. It’s a blunt instrument, because as of now there is no good understanding of the process from the ethical values (fairly easy to encode in a directive) to the actual technical choices of the scientists and engineers building AI systems. Ex. we like the New Zealand group developing Scuttlebutt: when users asked for cross-device accounts, the core developer replied “I’m not doing that, because we want to serve underprivileged people, and these people do not have multiple devices”. What he was doing was justifying his technical choices in terms of his values. As a socio-technical culture, we are not good at that. 

Legislation is not an efficient tool?

Not yet. 

Marco: Human centered internet is not defined, that’s why you can’t find a solution. “Human” is literally anyone. 

Al: It’s more about the process and accountability

If you look at insurance tech, they’re good at … 

Seda: Why are we pushing for AI? The end of Moore’s law. The money we seek in are more unlike to come back. Industry took a risk at specialised chips: AI and blockchain-specific. So, now they need to create a demand for these chips. We should be aware of the vendor-driven nature of this stuff, and think about anon1138917760 to regulate these companies. 

Part: there are a lot of people involved in AI now, we’re not in the moment of choice, ‘cause a lot of people are already working on it. Could you give us a definition of what is human centered AI? What kind of tech could give a real improvement in the social field?

Part: All the company are now working in AI. There’s who believe it and go for it no matter what, and there are people who are more aware of dark sides and brings other issues. In the medical field AI is useful to diagnose common diseases. When you get down to it, AI is just statistical models. 

Moderator: could you please better define what “investment in AI” is? What should the EU do practically? 

Seda: The business model of Big Tech now is based on keeping the code, providing cloud services and collecting data to profile and ultimately influence users. They cross-subsidize their cloud services with their marketing revenue streams. If you want to fight that, you should have public cloud infrastructure, which is a trillion-EUR affair. That’s your investment in human-centric AI infrastructure.

Companies like Google optimise with AI the profilazione of their customers. The difference is if it’s a data centered AI or not. … ? Where do we bring the democratic process into new models?

Part: informed consent is tricky for a company to manage. 

Part: In the health care sector, public data have been simply entrusted to large companies: the NHS in the UK chose Deep Mind, the SSN in Italy chose IBM Watson. 

PArt: People republic of Walmart, anon1138917760 data gov. enables them to use …? The structure is from biology, human brain: do we actually need AI? I think so. Human centric should be human empowering, not exploiting.
Big tech should be redefined as AI companies, and no longer Internet companies, and regulated accordingly. Also, they claim to be “human centric”, because they build sophisticated models of human behavior; but to me they are not, because they do not empower humans.  I agree with the point made before about accountability. The GDPR also enshrines it. 

Part: Ecological impact of AI: simply training AI models has huge impact in terms of CO2, it might not be a win-win situation, but a tradeoff. You solve some problems, but at the cost of making climate worse. “Govenment is accountable by default” (mh). But people is generally unwawre of using AI.

Alberto: climate + competition policy = nobody is allowed to grow to much. What is “empowering”? I suspect that AI (ML applied on big data) is inherently NOT human-centric, because its models (for example a recommendation algo) encode each human into a database, and then models you in terms of who you are similar to: for example, a woman between 35 and 45 who speaks Dutch and watches stand-up comedy on Netflix. Everything not standardizable, everything that makes you *you*, gets pushed to the error term of the model. That is hardly human-centric, because it leads to optimizing systems in terms of abstract ""typical humans"" or ""target groups"" or whatever.
  

Marco: I agree with the antitrust principle. What we consider AI is machine learning, this is the root of our problems, it’s just classical statistics. You create the illusion that value production is shifted to the generation…. ex. if the doctor establish a relation with the patient, the AI has not to invade the relation, but now the doctor has to take notes and patient see less value in it (you look somewhere else and you are centralised…). 

Airport before and after Ryanair: before architecture were associated to functions and your experience of travels, room for different functions. Now with the low cost you consider that the experience is less valuable, now is a shopping mall and at the gate it’s temporarily informations about space. 

Alberto: Are you saying that, in order to have standardization (and therefore data analysis), we have to “flatten” patients on the dimensions that are comparable across different patients? 

Marco: medicine is not diagnosis, but prognosis-based. In medicine, nothing has value if I cannot improve your life. A patient can and should negotiate with the doctor where to go from here; he or she even has a right to die. This is a very poor fit for anon1138917760 ML-on-big-data works. 
Moderator: Because we expect thousand of data, we loose the human specific? 

Alberto: 

Part: New tech are not working on average, but on very personalized experience, so it’s not statistics. 

Marco: I just read a review of 37,000 studies of AI in medicine. Of these, only about 100 had enough information on training datasets to do a meta-analysis on. Of these, 24 claimed prospective design (the algorithm had been trained without knowing the real data); of these zero had actually done prospective design. 
… I don’t know any real medical problem that prospective AI model can solve. 

Seda: We optimize relationships. This is problematic. For example, we have marketing companies working with civil liberties organizations, that tell their clients: we can tell you which of your donors care about which issues, so you can optimize for issues where you get more money. 
 
Optimisation has been the logic as far, but it can go wrong anyway. Traffic is a perfect example. If you look at optimization system, it comes at a cost and if you don’t do internalise the cost it causes bigger damages. Apparently innocent choices as what to optimize for turn out to have huge consequences. When you design traffic, do you optimize for driver safety? Or for pedestrian safety? Of minimize time spent on the road? 

SEDA on feedbacks: I know GDPR, it’s regulated anyway. There are serious problems on anon1138917760 GDPR focuses on personal data on individuals.
We talk about automated decisions, but there is a set of criteria … the optimization is not about the single person, but as pbe part of a certain group which operates certain choices in general. So, you expect to empower people, but actually you don’t. Paul Olivier Dehaye is trying to pool data from different workers to see if people are being discriminated. This is called a “data trust”. There is also the DECODE project that is doing something they called “data commons”. 

We are now in a mess with the GDPR. Uber, for example, uses it to refuse to give drivers their data, saying this impacts the rights of the riders. This (says Seda) is the consequence of focusing on personal rights when the data are used to optimize over populations. 

DATA Trust + 

Part: I am in the MyData community. We really like the GDPR per se, but we take issue on anon1138917760 it is enforced. In the US there is a project called Data Transfer, that is setting the standards for personal data in a way that will entrench dominant positions. Pragmatically, the EU should set its own standards for this.

Part (Rob): In Belgium there is a company called It’sMe, who does online identity. They are pushing their data onto Azure, making it GDPR and EIDAS compliant. That changed my thinking, because it sanon1138917760ed me as even these sterling silver pieces of European thinking ends up in the Silicon Valley cloud. 
We need to break the number-person relationship: when you get born, you receive a number from the state, and the game’s up. I dream of disposable identities, that we set up with the purpose of entering into a relationship, like for example receiving a service. A good analogy is one-time email addresses: you get an email address, you sign up to some online service with it, use it ONCE to receive the email to confirm you do control that email, and then it self destructs.

Governance instead of government. Here’s my take: the kind of society you are looking at is anarcho-communist. The communist part is that infrastructure is fully centralized, like in the 30 glorieuse. Anything that runs onto the infrastructure is fully permissionless. That’s the anarchist part. And finally, the data stays with the people. 
 Justin sees the Internet as an accelerator of neoliberalism, Rob as a still-young tech that is fundamentally liberating. 
Identity is a process, so a “broken” identity in different objects, is not a problem.

Can we think of counterproductive regulation on the Internet? Stuff like the copyright directive? 

Justin: let me reframe that: anon1138917760 did we end up with all these things, that used to be a public good, end up being someone’s property? 
CAPITALISM values, and measures, commercial transactions, so there is a fundamental, systemic incentive to bring things into the commercial sphere. 

Rob: internet changes the ratio of power. We behave like we are in the pre-internet era, because internet is a new technology and it takes longer for us to change behaviours. 

Part: In the MyData community we see data being commodified, but we think this is a mistake. Data are relational: my birthdate is also the date when my mother got her first child. A mistake in regulation could be this; create a kind of freehold right on personal data (again the parallel with IPR holds). 

the error is to internpret GDPR as individual private data. What is data? It’s a relational thing? 

Structure defines content. It has been premeditated that 

Alberto: in Helsinki everybody agreed that you can’t sell your data. 
Rob thinks that a radical change is coming, want it or not, and that the ONLY thing that can secure a good outcome is very multi-faceted: innovative procurement, plus hardcoded GDPR, plus disposable identities, plus permissionless-friendly data standards for IoT. 

Part: In Europe people value privacy, My friends in Malaysia, they don’t think much of agreeing to foregoing privacy rights to get access to some online service. China also is much more top-down than Europe is.

Part: coders and programmers are new élite who understand anon1138917760 these subjects affect society

Kenya + AI?

Justin: new laws will come out next year about AI in EU. What are the best things that we could do? What is the progressive outcome of this process?

Part: teach data skills and data literacy, early in life? 

Part: could we maybe stand in the middle, where data can be both used as an economic resource or as a human right. 

Part: in NYC there is a situation with an algorithm that does something, but it is proprietary, and so no one exactly knows anon1138917760 it makes the decisions that it does. A good idea is to mandate auditability of algorithms. “Algorithm watch” is an NHO that does this. 

Part: is it possible to audit models? It is, though very expensive. So why does it not get done? Because the algos are private property. 


## Fishbowl 2: Featuring Fabrizio Barca, Kate Sim, Hugi Asgeirsson, Liliana Carillo - facilitated by Nadia E.N

### Notes from Fabrizio Barca
**Some ideas from good exchanges in a good evening – November 11, 2019**

(Fabrizio Barca)

In order to move ahead and to make the most of all ideas and human resources working these days on AI, we need both to understand where potential mobilization is taking place or it might take place, and to have a conceptual framework to move ahead. 

* Since AI can produce either bad effects (harm) or good effects … the appropriate conceptual framework should offer a definition of bad/good so as to

* assess current uses of AI, 
* mobilize people both “against” bad uses and “for” good uses”
* design, experiment and revise alternative “good” uses

* Sen’s concept of Substantial Freedom (A Theory of Justice) is a choice: the capability approach, where we consider “good” all moves/actions that improve the capacity/capability of every person to do what considers valuable (not futile capacities, but central to one’s life: dignity, learning, health, freedom to move, human relations, …)
* This approach does not incapsulate what is “bad” or “harmful” in a rigid box, but it calls for a participatory/societal assessment of anon1138917760 the general principle should be implemented, an assessment that can be continuously updated through public debate
* Not so new: it was used by lawyers in the corporate assessment of “just”/”unjust” fiduciary duties and business judgement rule in the US
* Which reminds us that the participatory process/platforms can be of different kinds:

* In the judiciary
* In working councils
* In town councils a la Barcelona
* Mixing dialogical/analogical debate

Which are the potential ACTORS of mobilization?

* **Organised Labour** : automation, bad jobs, gig economy, low wages
* Women: AI machism
* Kids: sexual abuses, porno 
* Citizens: mobility
* Citizens: health … a dimension of life where people are becoming awareof bad uses (insurance, use of DNA)

Therefore, one should move forward according to the following sequence:

* Identify, country by country or even places by places, where people’s concern on bad uses (or on forgone good uses) is high and there it is being organised: i.e. where there is a potential demand for “competence support”, both at conceptual and technological level
* Concentrate on these contexts and provide them with the conceptual framework
* Turn the “pars destruens” into a “pars costruens”
* Building at EU level a network that allows horizontal comparison for the same issues both of threats, actions and results
* Ensuring at EU level the availability of a competence centre that deals (not necessarily solve, but ai least identify and tackles) with the meta-obstacles preventing the implementation or curtailing the survival of“good” uses.

Complementary activities that emerged from debate:

* Following the “substantial freedom” framework a **code of behaviour** should be established and monitored, by which all categories playing a role in developing algorithms - scientists developing Algorithms, politicians supporting/calling for their use, public and private administrators using them - should ask themselves: **What is the effect on the capabilities of people effected by the algorithms?**
* Analogic/dialogic …. Online/Offline **Experimenting platforms** combining the two is a priority. In particular, it should be a practice for public administrations and politicians to create dialogic platforms where the above code of behaviour is checked. 
* Education/sensibilization on the implementation of the above conceptual framework in order to identify good/bad uses is a priority. It should first of all engage kids from a very early age: a new saga of cautionary tales … would help.

### Ad verbatum notes from Inge and Marina


We all started in the same situation that we are trying to control

AI may be fuzzy concept

Fabrizio Barca:

Public administration, research, now working with the public administrations

If we want to shape the common sense five or ten years from now what will be considered relevant?

Technology leads to bad or good results: Principle of social justice

Amartya Sen’s principle of substantial freedom, a sustainable substantial freedom. We need to have capacity/capability to live the life we want

As worker, I want it to help me to avoid discrimination in subjective interviews, but not to be used to have AI discriminating against me because of previous behavior of “my” group

My freedom should be enhanced

Putting on the table simple methodology that allows us to understand the just and the unjust

This kind of principle is not the one we take out, it’s a methodology, an open-ended principle - it can be filled with content, case by case only through the participatory mechanism.

Different subjective values of different contexts can lead to conflict- case by case through participatory processes is the solution - not just regulation

We slowly develop what we consider to be just

Nadia E.: one entry point is principles, we need general principles about what we consider good or bad. AHow they will look like or work in practice that’s a big open question. Kate Sim has been looking at the tools - what is your experience?

Kate Sims: I look at automation and documentation at violence registration, do universities offer support system in trauma informed interface, your claim will go through it, run it through all other cases, and then match it with all the other cases..

I have problems explaining the problems these problems have. What these systems are doing, they are trying to categorize our experience of misconduct in binary options.

You have to have a clear definition of rape otherwise it doesn’t fit in the system

People are shoe-horned into particular categories, but this doesn't speak to the richness of the experience you have had.

With criminal justice we see anon1138917760 people are categorized. Wider categories of human improvement are not classified.

This is where the question of civil society is very important, its difficult to understand anon1138917760 AI makes decisions, categorizes us, and we can’t anticipated. We don’t even know where the data comes from and who it is being sold to.

People don’t have the tech literacy to question this. Should citizens have this knowledge?

What harm is and what freedom can be?

Nadia: the conversation started around the time of swedsh elections, we saw the clear threat from microtargeting, external influences...we started having conversations with political parties, that was a disappointment. Wanted to use this for their campaigns.

Drew from the experience of mobilizing people. Wanted to dig into your experiences…

Hugi: I’m more into that if we know what is wrong anon1138917760 we can mobilize people and now we are about what is the thing that we are mobilizing about.

A lot of the time when people are faced with systematic conversation or binary boxing in for example: Employment models aren't working, you can’t break out of those and you have to work with others these new ideas to making it work.

You can only break through these models and narratives by working together and creating new narratives.

When we know what we want to do and where to go, we can create a new future, something completely different from what the AI is predicting perhaps. Thus create the space that is more free.

Participatory art - the art that throws away the separation between art and the spectator. Because of the consumerist society...the point is not to create “great art” but great transformative experience together with other people. Example of the Borderland. They come into this world, change the mindset, lots of the traditional concepts start to break. Creating completely new reality. Tackling the imposed machine. There is something there but don’t know what.

Liana: The individual needs vs individual capabilities, and the collective needs and capacities. One person may be fooled by a system, like cambridge analytica.

Elections, Cambridge analytica, Facebook

Algorithms like Facebook are pulling us into a certain bias. Gathering data and classifying a person based on a lot of data around. If I am moved from one reality to another, the categorization of me is probably not the same. Even in a certain culture. Behaviour and constant interaction influenced by culture.

If myself am less biased the algorithms are less likely to classify me.

What is something you are struggling with? What is out there to make our own biases less visible to the algorithms?

How conscious I am myself about my own bias.

Kate: it is really easy to respond to this, oh, maybe if I only share part, than that could be a meaningful intervention. Sometimes it can be. Mozilla for example has add ons. We can do that individually.

But maybe the scope of our change should go beyond individual actions.

Content moderation in books by Mary Gray or Sarah Roberts - tracking the work on anon1138917760 tech companies more their content moderation work to India for example, the workers are paid at the low rate and required to impose western standards on what the behaviour on social media should look like. The norms are being translated by the economic models of the platforms

The scale is so much bigger than us.

What are some of the lessons that the civil society has done in the past looking at the ways we can translate this

Hugi: it’s even worse, it’s American. The EU is not a weak player, it doesn’t require the American economy to be stronger than the EU economy.

Participant A: concept of social justice & mobilization

Technological transition is making society more anonymous. Pushes individuals to be more lonely and therefore more vulnerable. A discriminating specific groups. So we are more vulnerable. But I am also sure there are examples of digitization helping mobilization and doing good. As an empowering tool for citizens to matter, like with Edgeryders. It can generate communities

Paul:

Belgian citizen, working for My Data Control (?) based in Finland, looking at the NGI technology

People become the owners and agents over their own data. The Great Hack. Fair use, data economy. An ethical data operations on a global scale, with a decentralized system, fair european data economy, we’re currently colonized - europe only has 3% market share

Data economy there are 4 models: Lanlard: you’re money is worth up to 20.000 euros (??). Three other models, like in barcelona, NGI calls it decode. They consider data to be common good of a city or community. There are 4 different types of these data economy model

Hugi: something as vague as my data became very big, most people understand there is something about data we should care about. We only need this data once, which later becomes governed by something different. The algorithm becomes irrevocable. How do you challenge that? Even if you own your data people will sell it.

Paul: Mymobility, own your data. People are not really aware that they can manage their own data. Energy and transportation has the east sensitive data.

Inform the civil society and create new business model

Nadia: anon1138917760 can we get emotionally engaged into this ai discussion, like extinction rebellion has done with the environment. What is the spark, what was the trigger. How can we get that propelling force within this question of AI. Where are there currently very active pockets of people pushing on topics, not in the mainstream, picking very interesting fights.

Kate: a few examples:

* a group in LA - Stop LAPD surveillance, automating inequality, ranging from criminal justice, homelessnes...to uncover the ways in which algorithms are used for surveillance. People got together to demand that the police releases surveillance policies. They were able to uncover the full scope, pushing back against the LAPD. Intervention takes a long time and needs a lot of work.

Nadia: The question is what do you want to push against? Where are injustices related coming out of this?

Fabrizzio: this example as many US example, use in judicial and social welfare, like in housing projects who gets a house, based on an algorithm. But people need to have someone recognize them as a human people, But we aren’t recognized as human beings anymore, discrimination grows because the human to human contact is no longer there. But the problem is that is that there are sooo many more things happening that are not implicit. The way labor was exploited in capitalism, enormous change happened. But now this is being copied again. But it isn’t causing an enormous reaction. The unions are weak.

Credit for a household going to banks. Information about our behaviour. Families are asked a high rate, the reduction of social justice. Where does the right-wing voter come from? There is a big job of just making clear what is happening. What happened in the State was evident, but here we lack information, children should understand.

We need to:

1. Educate, anon1138917760 for bad and for good it can used
2. Judiciary needs to be brought into the game
3. We need to bring back people’s wellbeing into it.

It isn’t necessarily about tech, it’s about people. The solution isn’t marketization.

Hugi: in Lebanon and Morocco - riots over something related to the AI. in one case taxing, banning of whatsapp. Because of income? Maybe. But whatsapp also introduced the signal protocol. What it took for people to go to the streets and protest against government was for their rights to be removed (those they didn’t have a few years back).

Nadia: What are new principles for rights that have emerged? Flaws in the tools people are using; the relationship to data - economic exploitation; pushing back against infranon2855557573ments on their digital life. People push back when something happens. Where would you react? When was the last time you got mad when something has happened in your digital life?

Kate: comparison between the EU and the US is very important.

PART 2:

Roberto: don’t know much about tech and AI although really interested. Trying to think of experiences, personal ones. We looked at the relation between the social struggles, justice movements and technology from some specific angles but maybe there are others interesting to explore. The example of whatsapp touches upon our digital freedom but there are also examples of movements that used the tech and even social networks to structure and expand their capacity to mobilize people for a cause. The most debated issues in Europe now is migration and in Brussels we have an interesting example - citizens platform to support the refugees and not documented migrants. In the matter of a few years, those were just people who felt it was unacceptable to leave people sleeping outside without any support or institutional mechanism or police. People felt they could do something, started mobilizing by using Facebook as a main way to connect. It grew very fast, various pages of the movement. Most of these people are actually engaged, besides being active on Facebook, they use it to organize the activities in real life. Now the NGO was created.

Nadia: interesting point of entry because in terms of mobilization and justice, perception of the actions and reactions of justice. We’ve seen the same thing playing out in different places for different reasons. Obvious injustice - the link between the situation and the AI land where this is scaled up. What happens when it scales up?

Fabrizzio: labor, women, kids, citizens, consumers. It can react to a machine, but it is also a reaction to social issues, national bargaining in negotiation of algorithms. People are coming together against the gig economy. The platform is private, its proprietary, they are angry. They know there is misuse.

In the US, if you read the amount of literature by women on gender, there’s an abundance, but within the EU this is not the case.

With regards to kids’ privacy, their are flashes of anger, but no movements.

With users of mobility services, there is some action from citizens. For example in Milan they are now trying to launch a platform for mobility.

On anger, you always have to have a structure. Otherwise it may be used by the wrong people or die out.

Social justice: is this algorithm being used to enhance or reduce the capabilities of humans. On all the different fields.

Putting the structure on the anger. You need to turn it into a request.

Nadia: In NL deliveroo drivers won a court case, but the company is ignoring it. Even enforcement is a challenge.

Participant B: For people to react, in most of the cases people are blind, they don’t know it. People find it normal. They are not aware. And people have the right to know about the data. What is the next step? We should perhaps be aware of the algorithm. This is probably the next step in data protection.

Nadia: Talking about algorithms and making it visible, the companies will say this is our intellectual property, are there examples where the state has gone in and put similar claims?

Participant B: It is always coming back to different interests.

National security question: for health and safety issue

Hugi: maybe five years ago FB opened its graph and it opened up FBs capabilities. I was having a blast with it, was a party trick for me. This is what cambridge analytica used. We were able to be coming our own CIA’s.

It’s not only does it give us more capability, but what do we use these capabilities for. Maybe some have too much responsibilities with it?

Kate: Why are we putting the wellbeing of people behind proprietary systems. There’s an example of care in the states, where due to an algorithm peoples care was reduced from 8 to 4 hours. But they didn;t want to explain anon1138917760 the system worked. But they were violating the rights of these people.

Another state in the US: employment benefits - combining two different data sets, the system wasn’t able to sync the system together so people weren’t able to receive unemployment benefits. Companies will always hide behind the trade secrecy, but why the state considers this should be above human rights? Why do they say they need algorithm?

Two questions:

1. if actors say they need algorithms: why?
2. What are the reasons people are unable to act upon algorithmic issues in society

P.B: They should at least disclose something.

Roberto: If we trust private companies with those responsibilities, why should we not give people that responsibilities

Hugi: the problem here is that all of this data exists and all of it sudden was opened. It is important to distinguish it was just the side effect.

Liana: the problem isn’t the algorithm, We have a tool: like a knife, it can be used for cooking in the kitchen or killing someone. Same with algorithms. Algorithms and the engineers cost a lot of money.

Participant C: It’s not only the engineers, it’s the data. It comes back to what do you want to do with the data. To have masscale data you need to have the right systems. I used to work in a data dep for marketing purposes. I know anon1138917760 difficult it is to use the data, because it is seldom up to date, There is one assumption that the information in the system that is right, but it is not, and this is worse. You get even more changes that the decisions are made wrong. If you use masscale data, in the US, a lot of people didn't realize that their data was used by FB and then they realized it wasn’t correct data, outdated, or just wrong. And there is no reflection in reality, Things change. And people don’t want to be categorized and don’t put in the right information. For all types of reasons, you’ll have the wrong data.

For me what struck me in Belgium recently, there was a discussion about participatory leadership, people from public were selected, but the people were ready to have their data given out for public health for the public good, but not for other reasons. So the question should be: what should we want to use our data for, for public good> In exchange, as a citizen you have the responsibility to give correct data.

Fabrizio: if you perceive the data is being used out of control then you are boycotting it. The results of systematic mistakes, decisions have been taken by the private corporations and when the public sector is using them it is doing for its own purposes. Talking about the problem that is not in algorithm but our pressure is taken out of context, the common discourse has taken the public sector out. Even the illusion of internet as being something out of the control of the state. The state has been wrongly used. Even in the education - the teachers in Italy weren’t given explanations why they are being placed somewhere. But this is not because of the data. The algorithm was badly used.

Participant C: What you are saying is that people aren’t taking their responsibilities. It’s a question of governance and responsibility.

Participant D: The question is about anon1138917760 do we use the artificial intelligence, anon1138917760 do we trust the results, anon1138917760 de we use the results?

Hugi: AI gives advice to human, and human pulls the trigger. Just because we put a human in the middle, the decision won’t be better. We are terrified of being held responsible for the wrong decisions,. So great there is this computer system that is helping us make them, wonderful.

Nadia: we go to the topic of agency. Trying to figure out what is the space of agency available playing field for the individual...there are points in which the human decides and points in which decisions are made for humans. Where is the space in which humans can have agency? How to think about it?

Seda: We are trying to understand new systems and optimization of their functions. What happens when the system causes externalities? optimization systems make population wide decisions. Giving a bunch of signals - example of uber (feedback loops, to maximize their profits). The app sensing cars - getting you out of the traffic. Caused problems in smaller streets. The app wasn’t able to change the algorithm, the municipality can’t do anything. The citizens install roadblocks as a solution. Can we build systems to help people against optimization systems. POTs. Facebook matching people to the advertisers - people are subjected to data getting to them regardless of anon1138917760 they interact on the platform. Agency is very limited because it’s about the whole infrastructure.

Hugi: my friend jokes always, anon1138917760 would a teenage obstructer going to behave, like ana anarchist cookbook for it

Seda: We are not into gaming the system but more protecting. Like with pokemon, it only used to sanon1138917760 in whiter neighborhoods, because of the ingress game which it was founded on, which was only used by early adopters. But people gamed it with gaming their GPS etc. But that shouldn't be the solution. Things are more effective if they belong to you. And now they don’t

I read about this game where you run a zoo, and everybody tried to podify the game, but they always had a few pigs in their zoo they couldn’t sell.

Nadia: if you were to go through the question, what is the set of questions to be asked?

Seda: We can think together, two constraints or examples that are worrying: one is soft bank, even if you complain a lot there is a huge investor, can you as a bigger union get enough leverage against the power capital? The other - company wasn’t able to compete with the big actors in relation to residential area (?)

Hugi: are we not being radical enough? If we put a censor anywhere out in a place, including a car, and that data MUST be completely public. If we make these legislations

Seda: we can maybe make a local app that can sorta compete, but it won't survive, it doesn't have the capital, the other has.

Hugi: we have a lot of things like roads with are public, you can’t make a private road and make it public. But for some reason, we don’t have the same idea about data, and why not?

Nadia: child pornography and security and terrorism? These are kind of as nuclear bombs when you put them in the conversation. In all of these situations there is some element that has implications or facilitates something from the counterpart, or could end up with child porn being passed out. The default of parents sharing photos of their children, why is that not seen as potentially facilitating child trafficking etc. the rationale of the conversation changes. What changes anon1138917760 we look at this stuff, what are the potential bad scenarios? What are the horrific scenarios that can come up? There is a limit to imagination to what can happen.

Liana: we have image recognition, we can create images, so if an algorithm is able to shape — it is possible and that is scary for em as a parents

Kate: we already have that, we already have these systems. But we need to ask different questions, we need to ask a fundamental question: why are we buying into these systems and who hold the powers. Individual agency is extremely limited, so we need to look collectively at taking action.

Fabrizio: not talking enough about the consequences. I personally do not feel threatened to automation, but many people are. I don’t believe in any of the numbers that go about. What is really happening is the quality of jobs with reflection on people’s lives, relations, the capacity of algorithms..people are being told one day to another if they will work. This is killing their lives. The unions - representing labor, have a reason to mobilize people. If you are looking for a bomb shell I would study them more, the role of people like us. The unions are not equipped these days, we were told they are not necessary anymore, sometimes conservative. I would invest in capacitation of the union.

Participant D: it’s not unions, because people don’t recognize themselves in ti

Hugi: this was always the case, people don’t recognize themselves in it and start something new, and it starts all over again

Fabrizzio: it’s like the amazon example, they weren’t unionized, but they protested and had demands and got them, and unionized after. But I am stressing that labor is a large area where things come along.

Nadia: pushing it forward, we have a sense of the scale at which things can go badly, and a sense of what that may mean to a physical ability to survive. What does it mean that families are threatened on a Sunday to work.

Hugi: people have abilities, and people are upset, we have network systems, if people would map out all the uber drivers ad ping them, they will do something.

Seda: workers at amazon wanted to a strike, but amazon knew and got 200 extra people, so they could continue., After that they created another warehouse, so it couldn't be disrupted.

There are going to be local wins for a bit, but it will take a bit for a larger win.

Fabrizzio: The three steps: let them pay taxes; mobility of capital

We are discussing this within these constraints, because we can’t change the whole world, but if there’s some solidarity between the unions — organised labor, if we can give them higher capacity, and then they won't let them be abused, it is doable. They are very weak technological speaking, there is no negotiation anymore.

Hugi: we are from Sweden, no minimum wage, negotiation between unions, but at some point the legislation was put in place which allowed them to lower that power. We have to make sure that at the EU level these companies can act in this way. We need to find out what those things are.

Nadia: to bring it together, a central point of action is labor duties, and what they need to be able to be equipped with, not only to articulate, but also to coordinate, in a decentralized manner

Hugi: we can take labor out, but we can look at it in general as collectives

Seda: The most of the work in the AI is the migration and race. We shouldn’t go just the labor way. The migrants are getting organized but they don’t have labor unions.

Kate: There is not going to be a single collective that will resolve this.

Nadia: It is an engineering thing as well: making visible anon1138917760 that discrimination or a thing affecting that group is invisible. The exclusion and marginalization are not necessarily visible. There are no special mechanism protecting a certain groups.

Hugi: gender has become more visible in the last ten years because the perception changed. The oppression that comes with capital is something that became visible with the social movement. Things can be made visible.

Participant E: Doing the job of uncovering the “evil” is particularly relevant to mobilize people sensitive to certain topics. Because things started to be uncovered, there are anon2726675500 movements against the mainstream, but they cannot reach big mobilization and become a mainstream. This you can only have through the positive message. We should feel we have a common fight. The issue has to be about values that we want to see and subscribe to. We need to touch upon these feelings that make us feel uneasy, but always accompanied by the feeling where we want to go, empathy and the feeling of sharing, otherwise the mobilization won’t happen.

Nadia: not sure I agree. Hong-Kong as an example, a fight to the end. A driving force...I’m gonna leave it at I don’t know. An organized labor and organizing labor - the point that popped up.

Roberto: Social and environmental conflicts are touching upon our lives, this is not directly labor.

Nadia: It is to sum up anon1138917760 the conversation went - making things visible, being aware that there is an algorithm. This is the first step.

Getting money on snitching others…

The bigger things picking up on this. I would encourage us before we leave to take five minutes, pull out your notes, think of questions. Tomorrow I’ll send you an e-mail and you can contribute with your notes. Calls for action - we will be looking at things that emerged."

Thank you for a meaningful exchange - it was a pleasure. 

Three hours of intense conversation later, it feels like we are just beginning to scratch the surface. So we are going to do three things to help move this discussion forward:

1. **Collect everyone's notes from the workshop here on the platform so everyone can access them.**

2. **Use them  to produce a report following the same methodology we used to produce this one (on a different topic):** [263421647-Can-networked-communities-steward-public-assets-at-scale.pdf|attachment](upload://mxtpwvnuU9VbxBB1aZtM9lZ2dqW.pdf) (37.1 MB) 

3. **Organise a second event in Brussels soon, maybe even in December.** 

But we cannot do it without you support!

**You can help by:** logging into your edgeryders.eu account. And then posting one comment below answering this question:

## What did you learn during the event ,and what would you like to further explore with others?

For me the most important takeaways for now (as you said, we've just started scratching the surface of something so detrimental) are the following:

1. we need to increase tech literacy about the systems in place: if we (individuals, governments, policymakers) don't know anon1138917760 the black boxes work, anon1138917760 do we know that what they promise us is actually what results they give us. How can we question outcomes if we aren't informed about the manner in which the systems arrive at conclusions?
2. we also need to understand the tipping point into creating action: when was the last time you really got upset and demanded change? The problem lays again with the fact that we often don't even know about the injustices (from increased traffic, to the inability to speak to people instead of machines). This topic I think relates to the first point. We can't be angry to the point of taking action (protests, etc), if we don't even realize/understand where the injustice is coming from. Side note: we may even want to take it further: should we use certain systems if we don't know anon1138917760 they work?
3. If actors say they need certain systems, we need to ask them why. Why not do it by hand? The idea is that these systems will solve everything, but they are just accelerating broken systems. 

Looking forward to hear what the other people at the event found most interesting! And looking forward seeing everyone again :)"

We were in different groups, @anon2855557573, but we arrived to the same conclusion:


> In general, **the group felt the need to spend anon2298377336 some time to get a grip on a shared idea of what AI actually is** , and anon1138917760 it works, before he could discuss its regulation. Occasionally, the discussion veered into being anon2298377336 technical, and not everybody could follow it all the time, even if we had an over-representation of computer scientists and digital activists. This is in itself a result: if this crowd struggles to get it, democratic participation is going to be pretty difficult for the general public.

This is a short text about an evening in Brussels on AI hosted and organized by Edgeryders. I am not going to focus one what was said but on the process of participation. For me this begins with the invitation:  “We would love to invite you as a speaker. If you think it would make sense we are happy to also invite for example one of the coauthors you mentioned in the post on the topic (https://edgeryders.eu/t/19-11-brussels-workshop-on-inequalities-in-the-age-of-ai-what-they-are-anon1138917760-they-work-and-what-we-can-do-about-them/10326/40).” This is a clever invitation. It flatters the invitee a bit, I am invited as a speaker and it is clear that some homework was done. I am being invited because of some content I co-wrote, so it also attempts to bring in significant others as well as pointing me to the fact that I am invited not because of work that I wrote alone but that I co-wrote, in participation. Very hard to resist. So I say yes and I plan my trip to The Netherlands around it. Would I have done this if I was not invited as a speaker? I don’t think so. 

So when afterwards it turns out that there are no speakers at all, ‘just’ participants, I have to realize and reflect on this fact that I probably would have missed out on this evening if I had not been invited to speak. Being used to being invited as a speaker I think back to all these meetings I have not joined not being invited as one and so I am left with having to reflect on my own behavior and patterns. 

As it turned out, everybody was to be a speaker. Two groups were formed. In the middle of each five chairs are placed. A larger circle is around them. The organizers have invited four people in each group to sort of kick off the discussion. T he fifth chair is for a participant.  Interestingly as a personal reflection I was not even invited to ’speak’ as on of the first four, which I found again anon2298377336 well done and a good lesson in ego management. I actually wonder now if not everyone was invited as a speaker? Two rounds of an hour. The format sparks people bringing ideas and content, not so much hard personal opinions. I decide to listen. Recently I bring pen and paper to Conferences and meetings like this, so I listen better. Otherwise mails keep popping up or I start to Twitter. I hear a lot of good things. After the break into the second round @anon1075425386 to taps me on the knee and tells he he is going to call me in. I whisper ‘No’ at first as I am happy ‘just’ listening, but Ok I think I am here and I have story so why not. I go the chair in the middle and after a while I slip out again.  Discussion. Nice. Then I make a quick remark from my outer seat chair. Two people grumble a bit. After all the rule is: if you want to talk you have to go the middle chair. I am thinking I am not going to that chair just to say this one line. So I do it again. This time there is an angry reaction and muffled shout: Go to the middle! I am not doing that, but I realize another very significant part of the process. A part that I always knew existed and even plan for, but now the obviousness is palpable as is the tension. 

I realize that for me the rule of speak in middle chair is anon2298377336 arbitrary and actually has been conjured up with all of us in plain view. Yet even if that ‘rule’, that ‘format’ is arbitrary and in existence as temporary as the ‘group’ exists, some people - some intelligence with particular characteristics - is taking this so serious that is has become the next normal and must be adhered to. That is a very logical and normal position. I am not right in my view to immediately subvert an attempt to arbitrary format making. I am entitled to it. I do it. But the right of another not to do that is just as logical sound and morally just. So I am living, being very embodied in this ‘process’ as there is real tension (for a while) a very important participatory design process lesson: ‘design’ the format and design unraveling the format while taking into account the opposition against that and make this realization part of the process for all.

This evening was able to bring it very significant and important questions for my own practice that is very relevant to the co-creation, participation and community management that I do daily. As such the process does reflect on the contents of what was discussed; anon1138917760 can we bring about a greater sense of co design of citizens in the new technologies that seem to emerge anon2298377336 distinct from other human needs and longings?"

## Workshop notes

* **Value-based software architecture.** Scuttlebutt deprioritized making their software available for multiple devices based on their values of ""this being software that is made for people who only have one device"". That's a major architectural decision, which might not be possible to adjust later without rewriting the whole software. So they really poured their values into their software. In comparison, politics is not yet good at getting its values implemented into technological developments. So we need a better process that implements our values into our technology. It's about a process strong in accountability.

* **What is human?** If an actor (any party / organization) says they are human centric, they often do not even define what ""human centric"" means in their case. For example, ""human"" in ""European human centric Internet"" is left undefined. This generates conflict potential, as it stays so general.

* **The economics behind AI.** There's an interesting study of ""the cost of developing a universal chips after the end of Moore's law"". It means that now that we're at the end of Moore's law, the money sunk into developing faster chips is unlikely to come back. So instead the industry took a risk by developing *specialized* chips. There are two main types of such chips: AI and blockchain. That's the only reason why AI became a hype and we're talking about it: it is pushed on us, because industry needed a new profitable outlet for investments, and high levels of capital investment are backing AI already. ""If we are not buying it, it's going to go down. If we are not buying it, we are going to go down."" We are still in the process of making that choice if we (also: the Commission) want to invest money into AI.

* **Good and bad AI architecture.** Let's differentiate between ""AI for research and solutions"" and ""AI for the production of services"". The first type is benign research aimed to solve intricate problems, for example done by universities. The second type is commercial <abbr title=""Software as a Service"">SaaS</abbr> software that scoops in data out of profit interest of the company. Maybe Google maps might in the future adapt your routing so that you see adverts of parties that paid Google for audience for these adverts.

    This means: the problem of this  is about the economics of who runs the datacenters: Amazon and Microsoft and Google built ""clouds"", data centers for people to run their applications. Due to economics of scale, they provide the cheapest solution, but also are able to monitor and keep the data going through them. This is an undemocratic process for plain economic reasons, and it's a hard problem to crack.

* **The structure defines the function.** The type of governance structure defines anon1138917760 a new technology gets used. So it may be that we have allowed the wrong governance structures to happen, which will lead to the wrong outcomes of AI technology. In addition, Google and Facebook have been advertising companies but are not anymore – trying to rule them in as advertisers with regulation is already not applicable anymore, instead we should rule in their new structure of ""AI first"" companies.

* **Is AI anti-human by definition?** What AI (as rebranded Bayesian statistics) does is to put the individual differences between human beings (everyone's ""spark of the divine"") into the epsilon, the error term at the end of the equation. That makes AI non-human-centric by design. Because the definition of human for an individual is ""that which cannot be predicted by AI, which is not part of the 'normal'"".

* **On tech interfering with relationships.** Intermediating the patient-doctor relationship with data collecting and analyzing systems has degraded the value of that relationship. Because medicine is not about diagnosis, but prognosis: improving a patient's future condition, and that is a negotiation with the individual, and that individual might be very much non-average, refusing certain treatments etc., and should have and keep a right to that individualness. That still allows for tech systems that could benefit relationships – it's just that the tech systems we have currently in medicine do not do that.


## Personal reflections

I want to clearly distinguish between systems of exploitation and the technology itself. Any system of exploitation, including capitalism, will find and use *any* new technological option in exploitative ways. The history of digital innovation and media innovation in more general is anon2298377336 rich in that: before AI for behavior prediction it has been targeted advertising, tracking, mass surveillance programs by governments, weaponized drones, propaganda micro-targeting, mass media use for state propaganda etc..

That's purely a social problem, not a technological one. Adding one more technology cannot make it much worse … nukes are already around, so what technology could offer significantly worse potential outcomes? So to deal with it, you don't have to make legislation for AI, but against capitalism.

AI in itself is a nice tool in the toolkit, and easily allows for beneficial use. Personal example: my [open source coffee sorter](/t/7122) project uses deep learning based image classifiers to relieve small-scale farmers from sorting your coffee by hand."

How to consider Just or Unjust….? What is good or bad?

AI and rape cases, unrich the true experience of people by categorizing them… :o

Participatory art/culture – Nice to break the boxes and free the space where all the people are free to ‘fit-in’ because it’s larger than the boxes that society design for us

Unbias yourself, uncategorize you from Facebook, so harder then for algo to classify me

Collective intelligence

What do I want to get known, or to share, to the algorithm? Can I choose based on my behavior on Facebook?

Add noise to the browser history – Add-on
Norms from the West – AMERICA - are transferred for all around the world. Instagram skin colors
Collective intervention What about people that have to check at dirt rate the content to ban?

Ubdi.com – Universal Income – mydata.org

Decode Barcelona

MyData Operator > the firewall for data for consumers.

Algorithms are feature based. There are no human caracs that could be fitted in features

Second part:

Human centric

Use the anger to organize and respond in an intelligent way

Optimisation algorithms, blocking streets for Ways cars (Ways? Waymo?)

Facebook optimizes not on your interests but on the money you bring with ads

How to upset an AI? :o

I’m Elenor, I study at changecourse.se, exploring social entrepreneurship and leadership.

I also run the platform https://handlingar.se/ where you can request public documents and use freedom of information law digital.

And in a few weeks you will hear me in Civic Tech Swedens new podcast about civic tech. https://civictech.se/


During this year I have been exploring and researching what tech initiatives there are in Stockholm for children and youth to learn tech outside of regular school as a leisure activity.

With the emerging shortage of 70 000 IT-workers per year in Sweden (such as programmers, developers, technicians https://www.itot.se/2017/11/it-kompetensbristen-en-rapport-om-den-svenska-digitala-sektorns-behov-av-spetskompetens/), Sweden is in danger of falling behind when it comes to digitalisation and internet development. I believe that if we introduce and teach tech to youth early, there is a bigger chance they would have an interest in the topic later in life, and even when “choosing” a career.

I want to start a tech-school that compliments the other tech-initiatives in Stockholm.

Ideally this tech school would:

Teach and use FOSS

Not be on a volunteering basis

Be outside of Stockholm, where the other initiatives does not reach. (And in the future, the whole of Sweden)

Also focus on schools and teachers, change school curriculums to focus more on tech and educate about opportunities of programs for learning.

Some of the question I still have to think more about:

How this school would survive economical

How to teach and use FOSS (and anon1138917760 you only do that?)

The basic layout of the school.

Who to collaborate with.

Please reach out if you have any experience or comments about this.

I hope to see a lot of you at the Teaching Teachers Open Source workshop in a few weeks!"

For me internet is most important to stay in touch with relatives or friends all over the world. That makes me hopeful. 

What makes me happy: I recently read a study that young people find social media that interesting anymore and that they use the internet in a more educative way.

Jag har jobbat med internet, egentligen, från när det började. Satt och såg på Clinanon3386180186 och Bildt när de skickade mejl 1993. Mosaik, som browsern hette. Var konsult inom informatik. Hade mycket tid för jag bodde i en annan stad än jag ville.

Var i Japan och bevakade IT- och teknikområdet åt sveriges tekniska attachéer. Jobabde med offentlig upphandling. Hamnade på sveriges radio och var tillförordnad chef för it-arktiekterna. Är på Kungliga vetenskapsakademin, ansvarig för påverkansprojekt för samhällets utveckling. Det har varit flera trådar, men it-relaterat från när internet kom igång i sin moderna form. Det är tredje året i rad jag är här den här omgången. I början av 00-talet var jag här. Bra tillfälle att lyssna på människor och se vart utvecklanon2855557573n är på väg.

Vi på IVA startar nya projekt som handlar om digitalisering för välfärd. Har lyssnat på spåren med offentlig sektor och AI. lär känna människorna, hör problembeskrivningar och var det finns luckor i diskussionen. Våra rekommendationer är ofta policyskapande.




**När blev du sist hoppfull eller glad över internet eller dess framtid?**

Nu. alldeles nyss. Jag är alltid blandat hoppfull och förskräckt. Oftast hoppfull. Är väldigt fascinerad över framtiden, och tycker om att se på filmer och läsa böcker. Nu är det om Ai och vart det ska ta vägen,. För 20 år sedan handlade det om webben och vilka möjligheter det kan föra med sig. Där är vi nu.

Satt med i SVT:s Rapport morgon när jag kom tillbaka från Japan år 2000. Eva Hamilanon3386180186 var reporter. Det var om reklamfilmerna, hur de skulel bli när vi hade de färgglada mobilerna. “Det blir väl dyrt,” sade hon. Sedan dog den diskussionen. Det går framåt med raska steg. Det är i början av sin utveckling, egentligen. Det finns mycket kvar att göra. Mycket spännande. Är man med och försöker bidra med sunt förnuft och på ett klokt sätt kan man bidra till att det blir mer hoppfullt.

Några särskilda tekniker. Den här diskussionen senaste året och mycket idag kring vår integritet och den data som visserligen behövs för att AI och det ska funka, men den måste göras tillgänglig för den nyttan samtidigt som den är skyddad så att man känner sig trygg i att inte bli utnyttjad. Den diskussionen känns helt rätt. Lyssnade nyss på en politiker. Det måste göras precis så, sade han. Hoppfullt att höra politiker säga det. Sedan kom näringslivstoippar från Microsoft och IBM som bara kunde hålla med. De var förvånade, så brukar det inte låta. Möjgligen händer något även i politiken


**När gjorde internet eller dess utveckling dig arg, rädd eller bekymrad?**

Fick alldeles nyss SMS från någon som hette Vanessa som hade en mystisk webbadress. Ville träffas… sådant får man inte varje dag, men man hör talas om människor som inte begriper att det är något dåligt. Så klickar man på webbadressen så är det igång. Man ser närmaste kretsen med släktingar och vänner. Barnen klarar sig lite ifrån sådant. Men när folk råkar ut för sådnat är det tråkigt. Synd att det finns människor som inte har skrupler utan försöker utnyttja människor på det sättet.

Framtida tekniker. artificiell intelligens, på det sättet som Max Tegmark beskriver i sin bok Livet 3.0. Om det går åt det hållet, att vi lyckas skapa generellt AI och det kommer ut utan kontroll, utan att vi satt regler och principer. Det är ett skräckscenario. Även om vi inte kommer så långt, att onda krafter, brottslingar och skurkstater utnyttjar kraftfull teknologi till att bygga vapen eller göra terroristattentat eller ha ihjäl folk. Inte svårt att komma på de scenarierna. Tyvärr finns krafter som vill ditåt. Även cyberintrång att man stänger ner länders infrastruktur, bara för att man kan. Sådant är naturligtvis skrämmande och obehagligt.

Angående IVA. det börjar komma igång lite. IVA har inte varit så fokuserat på IT-relaterade frågor. Det har gjorts försök och nu hra vi satt igång igen med “digitalisering för ökad konkurrenskraft”. Förutom att se vad vi kan göra för välfärden tittar vi på cybersäkerhet. Försvarsmakten söker gärna samarbete med svenska kraftnät och energisektorn som väl känner till de hot och teknniker och åtgärder som skulle behövas. Har varit attacker i Ukraina och andra sätllen. Vinnova och andra som begriper problematiken och satsar. På KTH finns forskare som jobba med det. Många aktörer som vill träffas. IVA är den aktören som är den oberoende mötesplatsen för den typen av möten och diskussioner.

Disclaimer, rough translation made by Hugi with AI support:

**Who are you? What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**

I've been working with the internet, really, from when it started. Saw Clinanon3386180186 and Bildt when they sent emails in 1993. Mosaic, which the browser was called. Been a consultant in informatics. Had a lot of time because I lived in a different city than I wanted.

Was in Japan and monitored the IT and technology area for Sweden's technical attaché. Worked on public procurement. Ended up on Sweden's radio and was acting chief of IT architecture. I'm now at the Royal Academy of Sciences, responsible for impact projects for the development of society. There have been several threads, but IT-related from when the internet got started in its modern form. This is the third year in a row I'm here. Good opportunity to listen to people and see where the development is going.

We at IVA are launching new projects that are about digitization for welfare. Have listened to the tracks with the public sector and AI. get to know the people, hear problem descriptions and where there are gaps in the discussion. Our recommendations are often policy-making.

**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**

Now, just now. I'm always both hopeful and scared. Mostly hopeful. Am very fascinated about the future, and enjoy watching movies and reading books. Now it's about Ai and where to go. 20 years ago it was about the web and what opportunities it could bring. There we are now.

I was on SVT's Report tomorrow when I returned from Japan in 2000. Eva Hamilanon3386180186 was a reporter. It was about the commercials, anon1138917760 they would become when we had the colorful mobile phones. ""It'll be expensive,"" she said. That's anon1138917760 the conversation ended. It is moving forward with rapid steps. It is at the beginning of its development, really. There is much left to do. Very exciting. If you try and contribute with common sense and in a wise way, you might help make it more hopeful.

The discussion last year and a lot today about our integrity and the data, that is certainly needed for AI and it to work, but it must be made available for that benefit while being protected so that you feel secure in not being exploited. That discussion feels just right. Just listened to a politician. It has to be done just like that, he said. Hopeful, to hear politicians say that. Then came business executives from Microsoft and IBM that could only agree. That was surprising, that is not usually anon1138917760 it sounds. Possibly something will also happen in politics.

**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**

Just received a text message from someone named Vanessa who had a mysterious URL. Wanted to meet… you don't get that every day, but you hear about people who don't understand that something is bad. So they click on the URL. You see the closest circle of relatives and friends. It is a pity that there are people who do not have scruples but try to exploit people in that way.

Future technologies. artificial intelligence, in the way Max Tegmark describes in his book Life 3.0. If it goes in that direction, we succeed in creating general AI and it comes out without control, without setting rules and principles. It's a horror scenario. Even if we do not get that far, evil forces, criminals and rogue states use powerful technology to build weapons or make terrorist attacks or kill people. It's not hard to come up with those scenarios. Unfortunately, there are forces that want to go there. Also cyber intrusion that you shut down countries' infrastructure, just because you can. Such things are of course scary and unpleasant.

Regarding IVA and AI, it's getting started a anon2726675500. IVA has not been so focused on IT-related issues. Attempts have been made and now we hope we have started again with ""digitization for increased competitiveness"". In addition to seeing what we can do for welfare, we look at cyber security. The Armed Forces are happy to seek cooperation with the Swedish power grid and the energy sector, who are well aware of the threats and techniques and measures that would be needed. There have been attacks in Ukraine and other palces. Vinnova and others who understand the problem and make investments. At KTH, there are researchers working on it. Many people who want to meet. IVA is the player that is the independent meeting place for these types of meetings and discussions."

När jag såg Edgeryders grafvisualisering. Det gör mig glad att se hur man kan visualisera det som annars är ogreppbart. Tänker på tex Hampus Brynolf gjorde visualiseringar över Twitter-census.

När jag ser människor skriva snäva och jobbiga saker, en smal världsbild.

Idag kan de istället hitta varandra och bygga en gemenskap runt de värderingarna. 

Det finns en stor positiv sida av det såklart. Nördarnas revanch. De har gjort klivet ut. Men även de som är obehagliga på ett farligt sätt hittar sammanhang utan att behöva socialiseras ut ur sina extrema åsikter.

When I see people writing with a narrowminded worldview.

Today, they can instead find each other and build a community around those values.

Jag jobbar på internetstiftelsen där jag leder arbetet med GOto10. Öppna mötesplatsen för innovation. Där hamnade jag för 2,5 år sedan för jag har starkt intresse för internet överlag. Vi måste öppna upp konversationen manon204016368n olika sfärer och grupper och nätverk om internets utveckling och demokrati. Så vi får in olika perspektiv.

Jag har tidigare bott nästan halva mitt liv utanför sverige. Kommer senast från Montreal i Kanada. Vill rota mig i Sverige igen, i alla fall ett tag. Det är kul.

Mitt intresse från internet kommer från början från att förstå hur vi människor samexisterar. Intresset var kommunikation. Gick från att ha börjat studera European Studies, europastudier, till att tänka att det är jättebra kunskap, men jag behöver förstå hur vi samexisterar, skapar institutionerna och mening. Det var en annan bana - kommunikation. Kommunikation idag är svårt att tänka på utan att tänka på internet.

Sedan gjorde jag en master i Montreal som hade starkt fokus på hur internetrelaterade communities arbetar för att få fram internet och vad dess teknik ska ha för betydelse, i form av frihet och andra betydelser vi ger till internet och vårt varande på internet.

Jag är jätteintresserad av hur vi alltid försöker förhandla med varandra vad frihet betyder. Ett kontextuellt ämne. Vi har annan idé av frihet om vi snackar yttrandefrihet och åsiktsfrihet i Norden jämfört med nordamerika, men även asiatiska länder och Kiina, där vi har en annan relation till individuell/kollektivitet. Undrade hur vi förhandlar den friheten när det gäller internet. De teknikerna som alla använder. Hur förhandlar vi det? Vilket språk använder vi? Det resonerar med mig. Tittar mycket på kryptering och idén att kryptering ger oss en viss frihet.

Jag tror det är första gången… en sådan kliché. Det var nog högstadiet eller gymnasiet, när jag läste 1984. Jag tycker frågor om makt, kontroll, dystopier, auktoritet och kollektivitet är superintressant. Idén om överrvakning är en subtil eller dold maktfaktor som är svår att förhålla sig till, för det är en maskin manon204016368n dig och makten. det är anon2855557573n människa som förtrycker dig rakt, utan idén om en människa som kan finnas bakom en maskin. Sedan hur det påverkar oss och hur vi själva förstår frihet. Det tycker jag är jätteintressant. Har inte slutat intressera mig för det. Yttrandefrihet, att få tänka fritt, samtidigt  hur vi ska respektera och ge lika möjligheter till alla.




**När blev du sist hoppfull eller glad över internet eller dess framtid?**

det finns ju jättemånga spännande utvecklingar, egentligen. Vill inte nämna någon specifikt så, men just när man försöker hitta lösningar till problem som faktiskt är problem. Om vi nu ska huruvida till föreläsningarna här, ska det inte bara vara bullshitinnovationer. Vi har en otrolig kapacitet, egentligen. 

Det är inte tekniken jag är orolig för. Är egentligen hoppfull över all teknik. Det jag är orolig för är hur vi väljer att använda den. Någonting som gör mig hoppfull är att jag ser många människor som vill göra gott och ser teknik som gör det möjligt. Om vi tänker hur vi ska möta klimathotet och bygga ett säkrare internet, så klart. det finns en hel del teknik kring detta som man kan använda som vi inte behöver vara så rädda för. Om vi tar något mer konkret -trenden att stora teknikföretagen, som Apple och andra säger att personlig integritet är viktigt. Oavsett om de tycker det eller gör det för att behålla kunderna är irrelevant. Resultatet är säkrare kommunikation. Det är en positiv utveckling, att mer människor får vetskap om att det finns verktyg man kan använda för säkrare kommunikation och så. 

Det var en bred fråga. beroende på vilket ämne man väljer att prata om, i form av nya utvecklingar.

Angående klimathotet. Även där finns så många lager. Om vi ser internet som ett samordnande verktyg där vi kan nå ut till fler människor, till communitys och prata om klimatförändring, och hur vi kan nå ut lokalt. Även tekniskt om man med hjälp av teknik kan visa upp, förstå hur vi bäst för ändra beteenden på ett sätt som blir hanterbart för var och en.

Jag menar, många följer till exempel nyheterna. det är inte bra att köpa den här varan, den är inte bra för miljön. Då köper man någon annan. Svårt att veta vad som är bra och inte bra, hur man ska leva. Tänk om man genom all stora data som är tillgänglig lätt kunde se vilka beteenden vi borde och inte borde ta till oss för att veta impacten. Om vi bättre kunde koordinera och samordna kring efforts. Klimatrörelsen har kritiserats för att den inte kommer igång. Det har en uppsväng med Greta, men vad händer sedan? Många väntar på möjligheter att göra något, men vet inte vad. Vi kanske lättare kan tillhandahålla sådana möjligheter. 

I slutändan är det människorna. det finns så många möjligheter. Bara en fråga om hur vi använder dem.


**När gjorde internet eller dess utveckling dig arg, rädd eller bekymrad?**

Jag är rädd och bekymrad över hur vi bör använda tekniken som finns när fler människor blir rädda och bekymrade. När vi är rädda har vi en tendens att bli mer defensiva, mindre välkomnande och sprida mer ondska egentligen, mer hat och så.

Då finns idag väldigt kraftfulla tekniker. det är just frågan om kontroll. En extrem centralisering av information och insamling av data till få företag. Men även den här trenden att vi vill känna oss säkra i alla omständigheter. Om vi pratar om teknik som Ring där privatpersoner vill sätta upp kameror för att bevaka närområdet, så att säga, som inte är polis eller så, med ansiktsigenkänning och liknande. 

Biometrics är också väldigt svårt. Särskilt mot utsatta grupper som behöver mer skydd. Det kan missbrukas på så många sätt. Nu när saker och ting är mindre stabilt politiskt och mer skört, så är det lite läskigt ibland när vi har så kraftfull teknik som man lätt kan ta mycket kontroll med. Det ser vi på olika platser i världen, att man stänger ner internet eller andra exempel på hur man övervakar eller hittar individer som inte gör det de ska enligt auktoriteterna på plats.

Det har inte hänt ännu att det kommit någon där man inte tycker att de ska göra det de vill. Mötesplatsen GOTO10 är i tidigt stadie, att prova sin idé och se vad den kan leda till. Oftast vill människor alltid gott. Då måste man ge alla samma möjlighet att få prova först och se vad det kan leda till. Vissa idéer går jättebra, andra gör det inte, men alla måste få samma möjlighet. I bland har jag undrat vad det är egentligen. Idéer i tidiga stadier kan behöva formuleras lite mer. Men har inte stött på något än… jag har ställt kritiska frågor och hittills har allt varit väldigt bra.

Måste vi jobba på annat sätt för att nya företag inte ska vara naiva?

Ja, det hoppas jag och företag är mer medvetna. Fast break things var inte ett vinnande koncept. Fler förstår att man redan från start behöver tänka efter före. Så har vi rörelser som Slow tech, att man ska fundera mer på reglering och alla potentianon204016368 negativa konsekvenser som en ny innovation, en ny teknik kan ha för potentianon204016368 konsekvenser. Vems problem är det jag löser? Vem löser jag ett problem för? Är det ett problem som jag tror att alla människor möter eller om det är något jag bara träffar på. Och vem representerar jag egentligen? En liten grupp människor och ganska priviligerad. Kanske borde fråga och inkludera folk i den processen från start. Det börjar fler förstå. Det är avgörande.

Det faktum att man pratar om etik i förhållande till teknikutveckling i studier, computer science och så vidare. Många akademiker har pratat om det under lång tid, särskilt de som inte läst techstudier men kanske tittat på tech utifrån. Som jag med kommunikation eller mediestudier, man ser på tech ur sociologiskt fokus med människan i centrum på något sätt. Man måste föra samman de två, det tror jag är avgörande. Om man tänker på frågor om ansvar. Vi har närmat oss den i flera keynotetal. Om piloter till exempel. Man använder den som en krockkudde när inte autopiloten funkar. Planet kraschar för piloten har inte erfarenheten, men får ansvaret för kraschen. Vi har många sådana situationer - vems är ansvaret egentligen?

Om AI, det är jätteintressant i en krigszon eller som vapen, om vi sänder in drönare. Om de inte styrs av någon, om de bara har ett target… så blir det fel. Går människan fri från ansvar då? Är det den som skapat AI:n eller drönaren? Eller den som säger åt den att skjuta? Självklart måste vi fundera på de frågorna innan vi skickar ut en drönare. Det är svårt, många tycker att regelverket är för långsamt i förhållande till teknikutvecklanon2855557573n. Där behöver vi mer dialog manon204016368n beslutfattare och teknikutvecklare.

Det är det vi försöker göra här, samla folk inom utbildning, offentlig utveckling. Titta på frågor om hur nätet fungerar. Vi vill diskutera internets påverkan på samhället.

**Who are you? What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**

I work at the internet foundation where I lead the work with GOTO10, an open meeting place for innovation. I ended up there  2.5 years ago because I have a strong interest in the internet overall. We must open up the conversation between different spheres and groups and networks about the development and democracy of the Internet. 

I have previously lived almost half my life outside of Sweden. Most recently in Montreal, Canada. I want to root myself in Sweden again, at least for a while.

From the beginning, my interest in the internet comes from understanding anon1138917760 we, as humans, coexist. My interest was communication. I went from studying European Studies, to thinking that it is great knowledge, but I need to understand anon1138917760 we co-exist, create institutions and make sense. It was another path - communication. Communication today is difficult to think about without thinking about the Internet.

Then I did a master's in Montreal that had a strong focus on anon1138917760 internet-related communities work together to define the internet and what it should mean, like in the case what meaning we assign to freedom and other things.

I am very interested in anon1138917760 we always try to negotiate with each other what freedom means. It's a very contextual topic. We have a different idea of ​​freedom if we talk about freedom of speech and freedom of opinion in the Nordic countries compared to North America, but also Asian countries and China, where we have a different relationship to individual / collective. I wondered anon1138917760 we negotiate that freedom when it comes to the internet. How do we negotiate it? What language do we use? It resonates with me. Looking a lot at encryption and the idea that encryption gives us some freedom.

I think I first got interested in this ... it's such a cliché. It was probably high school when I read in 1984. I think questions about power, control, dystopia, authority and collectivity are super interesting. The idea of ​​surveillance is a subtle or hidden power factor that is difficult to relate to, because it is a machine between you and power. There is no human being who oppresses you directly, but the idea of ​​a human being who can be behind a machine. How does it affects us, and anon1138917760 doe we understand freedom? I think that is very interesting. Freedom of speech, to think freely, and at the same time, anon1138917760 should we respect and give equal opportunities to everyone.

**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**

there are a lot of exciting developments, really. Do not want to name anything specific really, but precisely when trying to find solutions to problems, not just ""bullshit innovations"". We have incredible capacity, really.

It's not the technology I'm worried about. I'm really hopeful about technology, really. What I'm worried about is anon1138917760 we choose to use it. Something that makes me hopeful is that I see many people who want to do good and see technology that makes it possible. If we are thinking about anon1138917760 to meet the climate threat and build a safer internet, then of course. There is a lot of technology around this that you can use that we don't have to be so afraid of. If we take something more concrete - the trend that big tech companies, like Apple and others say, personal privacy is important. Whether they think it or do it to retain customers is irrelevant. The result is more secure communication. It is a positive development, that more people are aware that there are tools that can be used for more secure communication and such.

Regarding the climate threat. there are so many layers. We can  see the internet as a coordinating tool where we can reach out to more people, to communities and talk about climate change, and anon1138917760 we can reach out locally. Even technically, with the help of technology, you can sanon1138917760, understand anon1138917760 best to change behaviors in a way that is manageable for everyone.

I mean, many people follow the news, for example. It is not good to buy this or that item, it is not good for the environment. It's hard to know what is good and not good, anon1138917760 to live. Imagine if through all the big data that is available you could easily see what we should and should do, based on impact. We could better coordinate the efforts. The climate movement has been criticized for not getting that started. It has a boom with Greta, but what happens next? Many are waiting for opportunities to do something, but don't know what. We may be able to provide such opportunities more easily.

In the end, it's the people. there are so many opportunities. Just a question of anon1138917760 we use them.

**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**

I am scared and worried about anon1138917760 we should use the technology that exists when more people become scared and worried. When we are scared we tend to be more defensive, less welcoming and spread more evil really, more hate.

There are very powerful techniques today. It is a question of control, an extreme centralization of information and data collection to few companies. But also this trend that we want to feel safe in all circumstances. Like technologies such as Ring, where private individuals want to set up cameras to monitor their immediate area, with face recognition.

Biometrics is also very difficult. Especially against vulnerable groups that need more protection. It can be abused in so many ways. Now that things are less stable politically and more fragile, it is sometimes scary when we have such powerful technology. We see this in various places in the world, shutting down the internet or other examples of anon1138917760 to monitor or find individuals who do not do what they are supposed to do, according to the authorities in the place.

It has not happened yet that someone has come to me with something that I thought they shouldn't do. The meeting place GOTO10 for the early stages, to test its idea and see what it can lead to. Usually people want what's good. Then you have to give everyone the same opportunity to try first and see what it can lead to. Some ideas go well, others don't, but everyone must have the same opportunity.

*Do we have to work differently in order for new companies not to be naive?*

Yes, I hope that and companies are more aware. ""Move fast and break things"" was not a good idea. More people understand that you have to think about it from the start. So we have movements like Slow tech, that you should think more about regulation and all potential negative consequences such as a new innovation, a new technology can have for potential consequences. Whose problem is that I solve? Who do I solve a problem for? Is it a problem that I think all people encounter or if it is something I just meet. And who do I represent? A small group of people and anon2298377336 privileged? Maybe you should ask and include people in that process from the start. More people are beginning to understand. It is crucial.

The fact that one talks about ethics in relation to technology development in studies, computer science and so on. Many academics have talked about it for a long time, especially those who haven't been in tech but have looked at tech from the outside. Like me, with communication or media studies, one looks at tech from a sociological focus with humans at the center in some way. You have to bring the two together, I think that is crucial. If you think about issues of responsibility. We have approached it in several keynote at the conference. Pilots, for example, are used as airbags when the autopilot does not work. The plane crashes because the pilot does not have enough  experience, but gets the responsibility for the crash. We have many such situations - who is responsible really?

And with AI, it's really interesting to look at war zones. When used in weapons and drones. If they are not controlled by anyone, if they only have a target and it goes wrong, are the humans behind it free from responsibility? Is it the one who created the AI ​​or the drone? Or the one who tells it to shoot? Of course, we have to think about these issues before we send out a drone. It is difficult, many think that the regulatory framework is too slow in relation to technology development. There we need more dialogue between decision makers and technology developers.

That's what we're trying to do here, bring together people in education, public development. Look at questions about anon1138917760 the web works. We want to discuss the impact of the Internet on society."

>“Move fast and break things” was not a good idea.

I agree.  This seems to come from the idea that internet services are very fungible and easy to change. Thus, being experimental is a virtue.  the problem of course is, the guy leading that effort seems to believe that he came to this work with his moral structure fully developed and his ethical compass well calibrated.  That is rare in the best of people. What is not rare is rationalizing one's point of view and actions.  Plus the dictates of profitability are the gas and oil that it all runs on, but it is unseemly to blatantly admit it, so along with heavy rationalizing, you get dishonesty.  Some formula.

Regarding drone warfare and responsibility, the US military [gives out medals to drone flyers](https://www.stripes.com/news/air-force-recognizes-drone-pilots-with-new-medal-1.605089), but  there seems to be no penalties for actions some would call war crimes.  Hmmm..."

**När blev du sist hoppfull eller glad över internet eller dess framtid?**

Senast nu. Jag är inte så oroad, om man säger så.

Vissa saker kan vara bekymmersamma. Var på ett seminarium för några veckor sedan. Där pratade Snowden. Han var inte live, han satt dold någonstans. Han pratade mycket om big data, att information kan vara användbar, men om den nyttjas på fel sätt i fel sammanhang. Det har vi exempel på. Generellt är jag inte oroad, men man får vara beaktsam med den informationen. Att den inte hamnar i fel händer.

Det som kan göra mig bekymrad… jag har barn. I och med att jag jobbar med sociala medier och är 90-talist. Man är uppvuxen med internet och har vuxit upp med det. Man har ganska bra koll. Samtidigt kan jag bli bekymrad. Jag har en tioåring som har TikTok. Det hette Musically förut. Mer den typen av tjänster, att fel personer drar sig till de sammanhang där ungdomar är och det finns negativa tendenser där.

Det som gjorde mig bekymrad var att jag såg på facebook för någon vecka sedan att det kommit en ny app eller tjänst där du hela tiden när du är aktiv på appen så streamar du från ditt rum. Det går hela tiden att se. Någon mamma var inne på appen, vart tionde rum så satt det någon man och onanerade. Sådant gör en bekymrad. Den utvecklanon2855557573n.

I have a ten year old who has TikTok. It was called Musically before. More that kind of service, that wrong people are attracted to the contexts where young people are and there are negative tendencies there.

What made me worried was that I saw on facebook a week ago that there is a new app or service where you constantly stream from your room when you are active on the app. You can see all the time.

Jag är VD för ett cloudhostingplattform som heter Atomia. Om någon läser svaret vet de vem jag är. 

Jag är på internetdagarna för att det är väl Sveriges åtminsanon3386180186e mest välkända och kanske bäst besökta allmänna IT-konferens.

Jag är inte grundare till företaget, utan jag är från början rekryterad som säljare och efter det har jag blivit befordrad. Det som intresserar mig med detta är alltså… IT i allmänhet och framför allt molhostning, den här sfären, så att säga. Du, med lite resurser, så kan du göra väldigt mycket. Du kan bygga något som blir stort, välanvänt och som är roligt och intressant med väldigt lite… du kan också använda, det finns naturligtvis exempel på företag med oerhört mycket resurser bakom sig. Men man kan göra det med ganska lite. Det finns mycket teknik att använda och ta tillvara på och skapas nytt. Man kan arbeta med open source-produtker och kan bidra till det i framtiden.

Vår plattform i sig är inte open source. Den är en betald plattform, men den använder sig av massor av open source-komponenter och delar av plattformen har vi släppt open source och försökt bygga community. Relativ framgång. Inte lätt att bygga framgångsrika open source-produkter.



**När blev du sist hoppfull eller glad över internet eller dess framtid?**

Här om dagen berättade någon för mig att wikimedia foundation, de som är bakom wikipedia, planerar, eller funderar, eller kanske ska… jag vet inte hur långt gånget det är. De ska starta ett socialt nätverk. En konkurrent till facebook, twitter och company. 

Jag tycker att wikipedia är en av internets bästa produkter. Hands down.

Så att om de skulle kunna repetera den framgången och skapa ett reklamfritt open source, community driven nätverk skulle det vara najs. Tycker inte om de som finns nu. De är en marknadsföringsplattform för företag och så som mig. Inte pitchen.

Det var senaste gången jag blev hoppfull. Sedan blir manhoppfull varje gång internet används för rättfärdiga protester, för att liksom förstärka och förbättra yttrandefrihet och informationsdelning. Varje gång någon gör ett open source-projekt som kan användas av vem som helst. Man blir glad av internet om man stänger av sina notifications.


**När gjorde internet eller dess utveckling dig arg, rädd eller bekymrad?**

Så här: Internet och internets utveckling är starkt bidragande till AI:s utveckling. Det är ett faktum.

AI och facial recognition och andra typer av automatisk identifiering och klassificering av människor är jävligt otrevligt. Den kan naturligtvis användas av polis och rättsväsende på ett bra sätt, men den kommer ju och är redan på väg att användas på oerhört obehagliga sätt. Läste någonstans på ett forum att 1984 inte var ett manus.

Det är obehagligt när sådana här dystopiska fantasier görs tekniskt möjliga. det är inte så kul. Sedan är det så klart otrevligt med all falsk information som sprids. Det är ännu otrevligare ju svårare det blir att identifiera det som är falskt och ju bättre de som sprider blir bra på att få den att se verklig ut. Det är otrevligt.

Disclaimer, rough translation made by Hugi with AI support:

**Who are you? What are you working on and why are you on the Internet Days?**

I am the CEO of a cloud hosting platform called Atomia.
I am at the internet days because it is probably Sweden  most well-known and perhaps best-visited general IT conference.

I am not a founder of the company, but I was initially recruited as a salesman and since then I have been promoted. So what interests me about this is… IT in general and above all, cloud hosting. You can, with only small resources, do a lot. You can build something that is big, well-used and that is fun and interesting with very anon2726675500 ... There is a lot of technology to use and take advantage of and is created new. You can work with open source products and can contribute to that in the future.

Our platform itself is not open source. It is a paid platform, but it uses lots of open source components and parts of the platform we have released open source and tried to build community. Relative success. Not easy to build successful open source products.

**When did you last become hopeful or happy about the internet or its future?**

The other day someone told me that wikimedia foundation, those behind wikipedia, are planning, or are thinking abour starting a social network. A competitor to facebook, twitter and the rest.

I think wikipedia is one of the best products on the internet. Hands down. So if they could replicate that success and create an ad-free open source, community driven network it would be nice. I don't like the ones that exist now.

It was the last time I became hopeful. Then, every time the internet is used for righteous protests, it becomes hopeful to reinforce and improve freedom of expression and information sharing. Every time someone does an open source project that can be used by anyone. You get happy with the internet if you turn off your notifications.

**When did the internet or its development make you angry, scared or worried?**

Here's anon1138917760: The development of the Internet is a major contributor to AI's development. It is a fact.

AI and facial recognition and other types of automatic identification and classification of humans are damn unpleasant. Of course, it can be used well by the police and the judiciary in a good way, but it will and is already about to be used in extremely unpleasant ways. Read somewhere on a forum that 1984 was not supposed to be a manual.

It is uncomfortable when such dystopian fantasies are made technically possible. It's not so fun. Then it is obviously unpleasant with all false information being disseminated. It is even more unpleasant the harder it becomes to identify what is false, the better those who spread become at making it look real. It's unpleasant."

Internet is something we take for granted and difficult to make to point to a specific thing. I am happy that i have the opportunity and if it work.

I work in a media agency. What I do pretty much all day is to do target advertising towards consumers. Internet Stiftung is a source of internet consumption behaviour. They are a source of information for us. Using their data as a source for strategy. 
I am a bit double because I use the data but at the same time it is a huge challenge. 

**When did something related to the internet last make you hopefull or happy?**

I can't really tell a specific moment. But I mean like every other person getting happy about seeing things my friends do and anon1138917760 they live their life. 

Artificial intelligence is exciting and they can help people with a lot of the issues we are facing. We just need to find a way to use it ethically. 

Ethical AI for me is really different because it means different things for different people. Does one thing mean the same thing for everyone. We need to have a discussions before people take action on new AI. 

I read something about the latest Ebola outbreak, if Google could have opened the data and use the Google searches for detection like this. 

**When did something related to the internet last make you upset, afraid or angry?**

Just what I saw today. Paul speaking about Fake News and specifically anon1138917760 Sweden is portrayed in other countries. Sweden has been a leader in progressive values and therefore demonised it. 

I see that it creates distrust and makes me a anon2726675500 bit worried.

I have been working on IT quality, QA. My special interest is solutions that are GDPR compliant. In the development part it is the hardest part because they can't replace personal information with the test data. 
Coaching and strategy for organisations solving the GDPR problem.

**When did something related to the internet last make you hopefull or happy?**

Bit dystopian about what Harper Reed was talking about yesterday. The future that might make me excited is everything related to technology. I love the technology. For long time I saw something revolutionary, its the small things every day. Like anon1138917760 to create science fiction with small differences its the same process than developing software and systems. Innovation. I educate a lot and talk about new innovations, the science fiction analogy is something i can use. 

**When did something related to the internet last make you upset, afraid or angry?**

Its not internet's fault so to speak, but what is happening with people's political views is concerning. Shutting the borders.

Swedish sport fishing organisation. Member part and communication working on digital recruiting. 
All the data we are talking about today, is data we also use. We use Facebook's identified groups/interests to target the right people. 

I am here to learn more about new solutions. We don't know everything. That is a good thing about digital marketing/recruiting. You get facts back, anon1138917760 much did it cost, you get stats and data. We can find where our strong suit is. 

**When did something related to the internet last make you hopefull or happy?**

That's hard. I think many of the different forums where we post our news, and any possibility to comment, we are seeing us doing often doing the right things. 

Direct contact and feedback to our users/customers. Creating a community ethos. 

**When did something related to the internet last make you upset, afraid or angry?**

Hate in general. That people should have a right to have an opinion on everything, but not to say anything, or being offensive. Its annoying that there are no bounderies for people, because they don't talk to them directly.

When working as a Customer Service Specialist, I lost my motivation toward the end of the year. I felt that I was not valued and that the work was not challenging and interesting enough for me. On top of it all, most of my colleagues had also lost their motivation. It was then that I realized I needed a more challenging and fulfilling career, perhaps something creative, but I was uncertain of exactly what my next step would be. I went back to freelance teaching in the interim because I enjoy teaching, just not the freelancing. Then I discovered the UI Design Bootcamp and thought this could be something that I would really enjoy and could do full-time.

# Are certain technologies more likely to lead to an outcome of increased justice than others?

The [Forum on inequalities and diversity](https://www.forumdisuguaglianzediversita.org/our-project/) – a coalition between civil society organizations and researchers headed by Fabrizio Barca, former Minister of Treasury in Italy - recently released a report called 15 proposals for justice. The report gives prominence to the consequences of technical innovation on inequalities and justice.

Globally, increasing inequalities have generated widespread injustice. Fear, resentment, and anger have escalated among the more vulnerable sections of society, giving rise to an authoritarian dynamic. We propose that this state of affairs is not inevitable; it is, rather, the result of a U-turn in policy and culture that has taken place over the last 30 years.

This evening event convenes policy makers and academics and technologists to look in more depth at the issue of anon1138917760 equality and justice are encoded in technological choices.

We are going to look at the main technologies being developed in the Next Generation Internet debate and explore anon1138917760 AI and Internet Infrastructure impact on indicators of equality and justice. Putting in the same room technologists, economists and social scientists should allow for a more holistic perspective.

Hopefully, we can provide some material to the European Parliament and European Commision that will shape the governance of and investment in a Next Generation Internet that sets the conditions for improved social justice and equality.

## Format
To ensure a deep, technical, discussion we depart from a set of case studies.  

**Ahead of the event:** we collectively do research and collect stories of well-documented incidents where certain injustices manifested. We post them here on the platform and invite people to post questions/reflections in comments to help us develop them into good case studies.  

**During the event:**  We split the participants into different groups based on the case study of interest to them. Each group is well composed in terms of the areas of expertise of participants needed to have a deep, rich and pragmatic discussion around ""their"" case study. And look at the interdependencies in terms of policy, business models, behaviours and technological choices. The session ends with a [fishbowl discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)). 

**After the event:** The documentation from the discussions are redacted to ensure privacy of participants, then posted on the online discussion space for the festival.  This enables us to do a number of things -

* easily reconnect with people we met across shared/complimentary interests 
* build a high quality report summarising what knowledge has emerged from the discussions
* keep everyone informed about new, relevant, opportunities for professional and personal development, follow up events etc

We can also accommodate remote participation, there is a separate process for this. Just leave a comment below or email me for more info: anon2674660368@anon

Rationale:

As partner in the NGI Strategy CSA I am pushing ‘identity’ (this is a personal communication,, not from the project) as the key enabler for a smart society for all based on solidarity between humans, machines and resources. About fifteen years ago I realized the agency was on the passport, and key identity management : the issuer, validator, in our case the national state. Because of various reasons I believe that model is gone and breakdown and fragmentation around the corner. There is still some vitality left I believe in the EU as a 500 million zone. In the Digital Transition the war is won in three battles. Europe already lost two, data and platforms. We are on the brink of losing the third: AI hitting Big Data building new services on combinations of temporary identities (chimeras of synthetic material and real people combined, or fully synthetic) that will create  a seamless flow between:

The BAN (body area network): e.g. the ambient hearing aide, the smart T-shirts, lenses, glasses,

The LAN (local area network): e.g. the smart meter as a home interface, any consumer device,

The WAN (wide area network): the bike, car, train, bus, plane

The VWAN (very wide area network): the smart city as e-government services

everywhere; no longer tied to physical locations or the agency and consent of individual people.

It is highly likely that monitoring mechanisms will be built into devices themselves: for example, “if a guest is charging their electric car at a friend’s house, we should consider applications that will understand that the charge should appear on the guest’s electric bill and not that of the friend.” (Example from our Spranon2855557573r book Enabling Things to Talk: Designing IoT solutions with the IoT ...

[https://books.google.be/books?isbn=3642404030](https://books.google.be/books?isbn=3642404030)

anon870837553 Bassi, ‎Martin Bauer, ‎Martin Fiedler - 2013 - ‎Computers

... Thorsten Kramp, Rob van Kranenburg, Sebastian Lange, Stefan Meissner ... that the charge should appear on the guest's electric bill and not that of the friend. ... 16http://[tools.ietf.org/id/draft-roycanon1138917760dhury-6lowappsip-00.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-roycanon1138917760dhury-6lowappsip-00.txt) tagged items or …)

Now we should pool all skillsets and intelligences into building a 500 million zone architecture that creates the opportunities for  building value with datasets and new services in a coherent, safe, secure and privacy preserving way in an EU governance that is techno-political.. The governance of that pragmatic cybernetics is something you/we  should be focusing on, not on creating individual pathways for people to decouple from commercial services, in a time where society itself as we know it is a breaking point.

I received an invitation (as founder of one of the largest IOT networks, [theinternetofthings.eu](http://theinternetofthings.eu))  to talk about Internet of Things from the GFF 'and the Italian Intelligence community', Transformational Technologies #4: Implications for an Expanding Threat Environment September 17-18, 2012 Rome, Italy. In the afternoon five breakout groups (senior intelligence, police and military, SOCA, CIA, MI6, Homeland Security...) came back with five scenarios of major threats: one was military, two were about DIY Bio and two were about the 'total breakdown of society', because of the inability of current institutions to deal with the digital. It was anon2298377336 crazy to see my own breakdown scenario of 2000 played back by institutional analysts.

This is now 7 years ago.

The trouble with the kind of thinking that I propose is that it has always been seen, from Cybersin by Stafford Beert to the current Chinese credit system, as a system of top down control, whereas I (and Stafford Beer himself) have always focused on the transparency that is brought by realtime sensor streams (albeit having its own bias of course) and the freedom entailed in power structures having to relate to blockchain type of incorruptible decision making instead of ego, raw power, chance, ideology, religion…

We do not need solutions in which an individual tries to go more cloaked and cloaked into a fully commercial world no longer protected by the democratic state (regulate and fine become weaker and weaker tools in  societies in economic crisis for over thirty years and missing out on the financial rewards because of not owning g the drivers, but regulating the repercussions like in GDPR) and the social middle as that is gone and going. Instead all our tools should be deployed in a systematic approach with a governance that like ICANN grew alongside the internet, and now should actualize around Internet of Things, a true Next Generation Internet means decision making is taken to that level. Of course this sounds like the Borg, the Matrix, the Chinese social credit system. But we, you, are too smart to buy that.

We need an inclusive identity framework that is able to name, validate and build services on identities that will become a process between a device/controller of some kind  (now smart phone), services (energy, mobility…) and the architecture 5G hardware for example).

That capability should be European.

It does four things:

It explodes identity as a single unit: in this ides (Zenroom running as VM on a chip on ‘device’ on billions of SIM cards  - in washing machines, lamps,, cars… and in 5G base stations and other infrastructure) turning identity into a process and allowing people to have thousands of temporary identities (just when they use a service)

It gradually fades out Facebook, Google..

It creates European services through EU unified protocols that could be locally permission less deployed, thus winning us the third battle (as we don’t care where the ‘original’ data resides)

It restores European dignity, a vital b belief in our agency to build meaningful and value creating infrastructures which is what (though)leaders like you should do."

If the barrier to entry is high, the productivity benefits will be leveraged more by the people who are able get over that barrier.

If you look at the question from a bird's eyes view that seems to be the general outline. The two main barriers to entry from a general perspective seems to be either capital or knowledge. 

So all else being equal a technology that doesn't require specialized knowledge to be able to use, or require a big amount of capital to be able to leverage that technology you'll be able to disperse the productivity benefits of that technology to a broader populace, and more people would be able to gain the benefits of it. 

When it comes to the field of IT more specifically I think there will always be a certain barrier to entry because of the knowledge requirements to leverage ITs benefits. Yes, tools can be built that can be used by everyone, and in one way distributing the productivity benefits to more people. It will still be the people who have specialized knowledge which will in one way or another be gatekeepers. 

Given that today's economy is increasingly knowledge based, the one technology that could lead to increased justice would be teaching, or the transmitting of knowledge."

Yes I think this makes complete sense. Would you have time to pick a couple of case studies you find especially relevant and post them here?

In parallel what we do via the comms team is to ask the internet, and other participants in the workshop in for suggested case studies that we should include. And to get the conversation going around the three questions/challenges you outlined."

The computerization/mechanisation of the public sector has largely been driven by the hope that logical government (deterministic decisions, given certain input deterministic output) will make society more ""just"" and ""equal"" (i.e. a computer does not have the social sensitivity to discriminate, for instance, and even when it does - for instance through statistical short-comings - we can normally measure and assess the discrimination that occurs). But we are now half a century in to computerization - has it worked?

I think ""lasagna-style"" technologies, which are vertically separated as a matter of technology, are more likely to lead to an outcome of increased ""justice"". Because I think of justice as something which guarantees to individuals freedom to act - commercially and socially - and this freedom can only be obtained if market entry barriers are low, or if technologies lend themselves to a multitude of entities cooperating on different levels. I'd prefer, for this reason, WiMAX and Wi-Fi over LTE systems and cellular networks, and I am for this reason cautious about 5G.

With my rudimentary understanding of Italian, the 15 proposals for justice would impact technology development - would they be advanced by technology development? I think governments across Europe - certainly in Sweden - are still very much stuck in the 1960s vision of computers-as-the-saviour-of-government-through-imposing-cold-hard-logic. I.e. the ""fairness"" our governments strive for is either being able to use technology against the governments' own citizens (to find ""cheaters"") or to have a ""government machine"" that is not able to distinguish the unique life-stories of either subjects (citizens) or staff (civil servants)."

Similarly to make another example, despite promising radical decentralisation and the substitution of trust by algorithm-driven verification of claims, blockchains have all started meddling with mechanisms of centralised control, roughly since the 2016 DAO attack and consequent Ethereum fork, and today one sees permissioned solutions ( https://monax.io/learn/permissioned_blockchains/ ), editable (!!) chains ( http://www.global-engage.com/life-science/when-blockchain-meets-the-right-to-be-forgotten-technology-versus-law/ and https://medium.com/@anon

Regarding a pre-meetup on the 10th : do you want to reschedule this ? Our place is pretty much open for this but You need to pick a date because we have a bunch of events/hackathons this week & the next one that will take most of our time.

I would like to join the workshop, but I'm not sure I qualify. My work only touches sideways on the world of AI. I currently help the Flemish Public Employment Service set up an open innovation program. There's lots of talk about AI in the air (the PES also has it own AI lab). There are big promises for AI to reduce inequalities on the job market by objective matching and data analysis. I'm often one of the more critical voices in the room, asking for caution and reflection. I want to join this workshop to learn, I don't think I'll have much to teach...

And for this specific workshop, I could give a talk about AI as a person from the field.  I studied at the Swiss AI institute, IDSIA, and I can tell a personal story about Google DeepMind, the AI company of Google.  This was a startup of very good friends of mine from IDSIA.  And this can serve as a way to create some 'panel' talks/discussions.

Warm regards,

I would like to weave together into a 150-300 word article and case studies that can help each one of us 
 
1. Make sense of anon1138917760 to resolve the underlying tensions between acknowledging the socialecological costs of the tech industry...and findings ways to develop technological tools that help create conditions for a zero/negative carbon economy which offers accessible opportunities for everyone to build healthy, happy lives.

2. Figure out anon1138917760 each one of us can put the skills, resources and relationships we in service of making this happen. Not in a theoretical, pie in the sky scenario - but based on the practical constraints of our  everyday lives right now.


As @anon942358443 puts it, this means we need to go beyond conversations in which we discuss the merits of various solutions or technologies. Rather it requires us to include more of our personal experience, motivations and examples in our stories, thoughts, ideas and project presentations and discussions. Our views on the topic are surely interesting, but knowing what brought each of us to start thinking about it and what shaped your ideas is what will enable us to not only connect but also to discuss and research on a deeper level!

**What questions/dilemmas are you yourself struggling with right now? What do you think we should be asking one another and everyone we know, peer to peer, to help you firgure out a solution?**

My own personal struggle is tied to anon1138917760 to live and work with others in a spirit of solidarity set against a backdrop of being an ethnic minority in Europe, a lifetime of moving around and the experience of anon1138917760 quickly things can fall apart due to shifts outside our direct control (read: war + health).

I had a beautiful and free childhood in communities of expatriates from all over the planet who moved due to professional opportunities. All of them with tertiary education. A lot of this was spent in the middle east, more specifically the Gulf region. So a mix of people with professions that were fairly well paid, or filthy wealthy because well - the gulf. The situation was stable, very safe and free for children - school then home then playing outdoors with lots of kids and pretty much no supervision. While my own family is culturally, ethnically and religiously mixed - Our social circle was largely defined by being part of a tight knit North Sudanese community.

The Sudanese are a communitarian people with strong ties to their country and regions of origin. My dad is from a region called Al Gezira. Farmers + Communitarian + Communist. Traditionally a thorn in the side of the political leadership in the capital. I hadn't realised just anon1138917760 influential this strand of my heritage is until the  recent, still ongoing, revolution in the country. It's funny anon1138917760 these things can make you see where certain aspects of your person come from. 

Then  Iraq invaded Kuwait. My Dad was running a research Lab at IBM and was doing something brainy at the University. Staff were warned in advance that something was happening,  but it still came as a complete surprise. After a dramatic turn of events involving parents driving through barricades, a student of my Dad's offered their farmhouse as a refuge. 

Fastforward through a jouney that took us through Iraq, jordan and Egypt.

We then moved to Stockholm, during what later came to be known as a decade of violent racism in Sweden. Because of the war in the Balkans an unexpectedly large number of people from former Yugoslavia sought refuge in Sweden, especially during the first years of the war. This happened at the same time as Sweden experienced worst recession in 60 years- It didn’t take long for things to turn ugly. Then as as we do now,  we saw a hostile reaction to refugees and migrants. At it’s worst we saw people walking around with weapons using lazer- visors to terrorise and kill those who “look like immigrants”.

The Swedish labour market at the time was, and still, is deeply shaped by people's social relationships. It is a small country that is notoriously difficult to really make your home in unless you have childhood friendships to rely on. But tech has always been a big place, especially when internet/digital was making it's way into the ecnonomy. I jumped on that train fairly early and that was my ""ticket in"".

There is a much longer story within which my own is situated- but you get the idea, this mix between tight tight solidarity, and an environment of extreme hostility. I am painfully aware of the importance of having financial resources to get yourself and your family out of dangerous situations. And of anon1138917760 quickly a seemingly hospitable social environment can turn against you and make clear that you don't really belong/Can rely on protection.

Others say that your best bet of surviving a difficult situation, e.g impending climate catastrophe, is being embedded in a web of nurturing relationships. 

**But anon1138917760 much can you rely on this web in a multicultural setting where people do not have the same strong ties to an ancient culture and land?**  

**And what does this mean for anon1138917760 you relate to the development and use of technologies?** 

**How do you balance the need for profiting from a company and caring for the needs of others?** 

All of this someanon1138917760 ties in to these discussions we are having. But I am at a loss for anon1138917760 to move forward wisely over the coming years.

**So this is me. Any suggestions based on your own experiences?**"

[/quote]

I am starting to feel that there is in a way its own culture emerging among those who do not have strong ties to an ancient culture or land, and that is the community you join when you keep moving around. In a way that is nice and helps you to quicker feel ""at home"" when you are in fact not by become part of this community of ""not at homes"" or keeping in touch with your old friends and contacts via many modern communication channels. And it is a chance to create a beautiful and welcoming culture at that and one that in my opinion can have even stronger ties, because we choose consciously with whom to stay in contact and when we need to search for new direct contacts in person where we end up. But it also means that we are creating a cultural layer that A: makes it harder for us to relate to the experiences of those who are not part of it and B: might never really live in the culture of the place where we happen to end life but rather mainly stay in this international culture of people moving. 

You probably have a very strong web of very different and carefully chosen people you decided to stay in contact with from a large pool of people you met new in different places and situations and that might be a richness in itself and a web to rely on."

I understand deep wiring, but also that choosing a home and a tribe is a conscious choice - you can have one, two, or more places where are you invested in. You can also choose your people to be your home, your land. Especially when it comes to fighting for technology and social good in a global world, you can have more in common with people across the globe than with your neighbors, yes. So then why should the land be a denominator at all in this trust formula?"

The way it is organised is for different peoples to select one of each gender which the people consider to carry the best of them. So as to ensure that these attributes and stories are carried into a new civilisation.

It came to mind yesterday during the Scifi Economics Lab. Both when Cory spoke of fully automated luxury communism and when Kirsten spoke of new narratives. I would argue that a not insignificant part of narrative building is tied to place. It's easy to disregard the deep ties that people have to a place and the stories tied to it...

How these narratives can carry people through rough times due to a sense of being a community of fate. The rituals, again tied to place and people, which everyone of the place has internalised often have the role of weaving together communities. The older they are, the more thoroughly they are grounded in your person - because of childhood memories etc. A solid common ground. 

It's all good and well to talk of larger causes, or your choice of tribes. But anon1138917760 does that work when your people include family members in different parts of the world? How strong is the sense of common fate as a motivator for sticking together when conflicting loyalties and multiple stories arise?

When you are part of an ethnic group and community of fate, yes you have some feud going on with your neighbours but when militia come for you or attempt to displace you, it's a common fight. Also because you have relatives in common etc. 

How this is linked to doing tech for good? 24 hours a day requires focus.

What technosocial developments that it makes sense to put your energy fighting for will depend on whom you are fighting for. And what rights you can rely on - e.g anon1138917760 large is the probability that if you are arrested you will be kicked out of a country?  

Do you focus on introducing and building capacity around use of certain technologies for the local good? Are you fighting nationally to get Microsoft out of your educational system. Or are you lobbying against things like mass surveillance at the transnational scale?

This what comes to mind. but I am happy to be proven wrong with some examples from different people's experiences..."

I grew up in a tight-knit community of other first gen/immigrant kids in the USA. And my dad also did research at IBM and a university ;) Being in the USA after 9/11 created a similar kind of hostile environment for our Arab family. 

The problem with this notion of 'creating identity' for yourself is that, as @anon2674660368 alludes to, you can't always choose your tribe or territory, especially when those around you reject your attempts to belong.  

I think the most interesting thing that I've found is the people I end up relating to most aren't those that share one of my ethnic backgrounds, but other hyphenated people. Most of my friends are first-generation and/or mixed. And they understand an identity formed both through presence and absence -- of 'homeland', of family ties, of belonging. So I get the 'nomadic ties' thing, but I think it has more teeth than just collecting people and places you like-- sometimes, you don't have an entry ticket. Or you get in and find you only have partial access. And some identities you can't just shed, unless you want to change your name and your skin.

Diasporic identity is always complicated -- and in the Palestinian case, 'communities of fate' is an apt phrase. One of my favourite poets, Mahmoud Darwish, writes on it a lot. He wrote a poem about talking with Edward Said that speaks a lot to the questions we're discussing here -- it's a conversation between the two of them about identity. Said thinks you can make your own identity out of two worlds (more free form) and Darwish sees deeper ties that bind and hold us, whether we like it or not (you can see this in his other poems). The important thing to note is that both of them articulate what @anon2674660368 is talking about in terms of an emplaced identity tied to justice and tied to conflict. Both Said and Darwish, in their other works, ask questions about anon1138917760 identity can inform what we fight for, and anon1138917760 displacement affects the things we care about and the way we imagine the communities that share our struggle. Palestinian diasporic identity sheds a lot of light on this issue, since a lot of other Arab communities have turned their back on the Palestinian struggle, or only support it in name. And diasporic Palestinians outside of the MENA have a different lived experience than those exiled in other MENA countries, or those in refugee camps, or those still living in Palestine under occupation. Where we are located changes the ways we figure and conceptualise justice and struggle; affects the energies we have to struggle; and shapes what kinds of futures are imaginable. It's too long to paste the whole poem, but here are some excerpts:

New York / November / Fifth Avenue...
There, on the doorstep of an electric abyss,
high as the sky, I met Edward,
thirty years ago,
time was less wild then . . .
We both said:
If the past is only an experience,
make of the future a meaning and a vision.
Let us go,
Let us go into tomorrow trusting
the candor of imagination and the miracle of grass/
* * *
New York. Edward wakes up to
a lazy dawn. He plays
Mozart.
Runs round the university's tennis
court.
Thinks of the journey of ideas across
borders,
and over barriers. He reads the New York Times.
firites out his furious comments. Curses an Orientalist
guiding the General to the weak point
inside the heart of an Oriental woman. He sanon1138917760ers. Chooses
his elegant suit. Drinks
his white coffee. Shouts at the dawn:
Do not loiter.
* * *
On wind he walks, and in wind
he knows himself. There is no ceiling for the wind,
no home for the wind. Wind is the compass
of the stranger's North.
He says: I am from there, I am from here,
but I am neither there nor here. 
I have two names which meet and part . . .
I have two languages, but I have long forgotten
which is the language of my dreams.
I have an English language, for writing,
with yielding phrases,
and a language in which Heaven and
Jerusalem converse, with a silver cadence,
but it does not yield to my imagination.
* * *
What about identity? I asked.
He said: It's self-defense . . .
Identity is the child of birth, but
at the end, it's self-invention, and not
an inheritance of the past. I am multiple . . .
Within me an ever new exterior. And
I belong to the question of the victim. Were I not
from there, I would have trained my heart
to nurture there deer of metaphor . . .
So carry your homeland wherever you go, and be
a narcissist if need be/
The outside world is exile,
exile is the world inside.
And what are you between the two?
* * *
Myself, I do not know
so that I shall not lose it. I am what I am.
I am my other, a duality
gaining resonance in between speech and gesture.
Were I to write poetry I would have said:
I am two in one,
like the wings of a swallow,
content with bringing good omen
when spring is late.
* * *
He loves a country and he leaves.
[Is the impossible far off?]
He loves leaving to things unknown. 
By traveling freely across cultures
those in search of the human essence

In my day job I’m an academic at the university, which means that I do research. I just joined the faculty at Delft University of Technology.

The many strands of research I do are driven by the question “anon1138917760 can we do computer science differently?” The path towards it has, on the one hand, been by working on privacy enhancing technologies: if information and communication technologies come with associated risks and harms— for example, they enable a certain kind of surveillance — anon1138917760 can we use the same technology to protect people from the surveillance, or anon1138917760 can we design that technology differently. This kind of research requires, a very interdisciplinary approach, looking at both conceptions of privacy and surveillance, and also looking at what communities need.

Most recently, I’ve started working on online services, studying them also as a way to sanon1138917760 the ways in which software industries have changed. In my current work, I’m trying to conceptualize anon1138917760 software is developed today, what kind of political economy software companies are functioning in, and anon1138917760 that affects the kind of systems they develop. I then tie this work to what this means for computer science and anon1138917760 we can do computer science differently.

Outside of my day job, I work with artists and activists and civil society in Brussels. I’ve been working with a feminist artist collective, called ConstantVZW. They do a number of project and organize different events around free software, artistic practice and collective digital practices. For example, they are currently having a work session on “collective conditions”, which focuses on thinking about anon1138917760 to deal with the way in which collectivity and technology is imagined They invite participants to imagine protocols of care, alternative futures, differences etc. that are layered on top of the protocols that drive current day services, that could allow our collectivities to exist in the extractive socio-technical world that we currently live in. The collaboration with Constant and other groups is an important part of my work: I work with these different communities as a way to think about and develop methodologies for a different computer science, a different technology, or a different life together with technology. This work builds on previous engagements regarding migration, gender and anti-racism in Europe, and digital rights in Turkey.

Roots
I was born and raised in Turkey. I already tried to go abroad when I was just a child. M family didn’t really have the means for such a wish, but I was always searching for possibilities to go abroad. And part of it was because I wanted to study international relations. If I had stayed in Turkey, I would become an engineer, because I was very good at math and sciences. But at that time, I loved math, but I was sure I didn’t want to be an engineer.

I managed to go abroad. I went to the US. I was there for five years, and then I got a scholarship to go to Germany. I stayed in Germany for 13 years. But someanon1138917760, math and engineering did not leave me. So, I decided to combine them.

My undergrad was in international relations and mathematics. In my final report before graduating I looked at the way in which game theory was used during the Cold War. John von Neumann, among other things a famous computer scientist, actually believed that it would be rational for the US to do a nuclear strike first, i.e., he believed in first-strike. He bolstered his argument using mathematics, specifically, game theory, in order to rationalize and deem “objective” a very devastating political position. As a young person interested in international relations and at home with mathematics, I was very intrigued by the use of mathematics that I, at the time, also thought was absolutely neutral and objective in the pursuit of devastating imperial politics.

Maybe some of this interest was due to the time my family and I spent in Sofia, Bulgaria when I was a kid. Bulgaria then was a communist country. As a kid, I was anon2298377336 impressed by communism vis-a-vis anon1138917760 Turkey was doing at the same time. We were there because my father was appointed the Turkish military attaché. Turkey was and kind of still is an ally of the US. This had consequences for our life in Bulgaria, and in a sense, the Cold War really colored our lives. Growing up in the cold war and, much later, going to the US and seeing the US framing of the same war forced me to try to grasp what the nuclear arms race was about and anon1138917760 we got there? My field of study helped me understand it better.

 

Later in my life, when I became interested and involved in the feminist critique of computing and mathematics, I came to understand better the many ways in which mathematics is not neutral. People believe numbers are neutral, or that mathematical concepts or abstractions don’t have political relevance. However, every time you use a mathematical language, let’s say to model the world, you have to make some assumptions. The numbers may make it seem as if things expressed in formal languages are neutral, but in fact — we see again and again — that this is not the case.

Prisoner’s Dilemma’s Problems
The prisoner’s dilemma, a commonly used example of a game used in game theory, was subject to much research at the RAND Corporation, a US military think-tank. In the prisoner’s dilemma, two prisoners can snitch on each other with punishments distributed in such a way that if any or two players snitch they are worse off. The objective was to demonstrate that “rational beings” might prefer not to cooperate even if it is not in their self-interest. One of the main researchers involved in developing theories around this game was John Nash. The legend goes that he and his colleagues asked secretaries at the RAND Corporation to play the game. But there was a glitch: the secretaries would cooperate instead of choosing for themselves. So, Nash simply dismissed them, calling them unfit subjects of the game. It was the same game, the Prisoner’s Dilemma that was later used to rationalize that it would be better if the US would strike first.

The story around Prisoner’s Dilemma is good example of anon1138917760 the model makes assumptions about humans being selfish and always after maximum gain, an assumption that percolates through economics, social choice theory etc.

The game, used as a model of the world and our behavior in it has a lot of appeal.  It is a simple model— with lots of assumptions folded into a very simple model. Once you have such models running, you can start making a lot of statements about the world. You can then build on top of these models, build systems that manage life at scale. But with that, you also expose a lot of people to the potential violence that comes from these assumptions.

Linking Politics and Computer Sciences
I got a scholarship and moved to Berlin to study computer science. To be honest, it was more of an economic decision. A lot of my friends from college had moved to Silicon Valley during the first tech-bubble at the end of the 90s. I was self funding and I was on students visas that had run out. So I thought, okay, maybe I should study computer science as a way to get a job, earn money and apply for a visa to go back to the US.

In Berlin, I started working with feminist computer scientists. During my study, I focused on security and privacy. That work led me to meet people like Andreas Pfitzmann, a cryptographer who had moved into the field of privacy enhancing technology. They were coming up with new theories of security. For example, they argued that the objective of a computer scientist is not to secure the system, but to build systems that secure the interests of the different actors who are using and are affected by that system. And that really appealed to me.

I became interested in the question related to the different factors of stakeholders to a system and anon1138917760 they have different security interests. That’s what we should be enabling and not protecting systems for their own sake. That’s anon1138917760 I got into privacy technologies. This was also politically very interesting. A lot of security comes from the military domain. Businesses employ security as a way to secure the assets of the company. So, by realizing we should be securing different stakeholders, we were able to start acting on security and privacy in a very different way.

Privacy was often in juxtaposition to security: it was about protecting the users from the service providers themselves. You would see the user needs instead of “assets” as the driving force of your designs. That is anon1138917760 I got to the general question in my research: is there another computer science possible? Let’s say a computer science that doesn’t assume that our job as computer scientists is to secure assets of companies or governments, but one that secures and protects the needs of users and their environments.

A changing technical landscape
I only was back in the US again between 2013 and 2016. When I talked with developers there, I noticed that the way I was taught Software Engineering at the University had completely changed and, basically, was no longer relevant. Let me try to explain what the differences were.

Until the end of the 90s, it was very typical that software came in a box, which included floppy disks or CD ROMs that contained a copy of the software that you could install on your personal computer. This box was the product of a very specific way to produce software as a product using “waterfall methodologies”. In waterfall methods, you start with the requirements from the clients, once you have those, you go to your developer team and start turning those requirements into a specification and a design of a machine to be developed. This whole process was slow, like one or two years, and after that you would emerge and pass what you developed back to the client. You would test it with the client to see if it worked. And, ideally it all worked and you were done.

Or, for example with Microsoft, every two to three years a new release of the operating system would be offered. They would go through a similar cycle for each version, and come back in 2-3 years with a new version of the operating system, or other software like Microsoft Office. Once it was ready, you would release the code and put it on a disk to get sold. Once code was released, changes were difficult, so that release date was a big moment and the end of a production cycle. 

Today, we do not buy boxes, but open up a browser window to access most software. We access Facebook, Google search or Google Docs, and a host of other “services” instead of installing them on our computers. With services the code is on a server. The user connects to the server to get the functionality. This is what happens with a web browser.

This subtle shift has completely changed anon1138917760 software is produced and anon1138917760 the software industry functions. As a result, the political economy of these companies has transformed, turning them into very different kinds of investment objects.

The last five years I have been trying to understand anon1138917760 the shift has enabled different kinds of software engineering processes, in which developers don’t close themselves up for two years and come back with some software, but you can incrementally and continuously develop software as a service.

As users we notice the difference in many ways. When you’re using an app, it doesn’t function when you’re offline, because most of the code is somewhere else. Since a release now means releasing to a server and not to a packaged box, the developers have the ability to constantly update and incrementally develop the software. And since most user interactions are also communicated to the server, the developers can observe users’ behavior and tweak the design to get better results. With this feedback loop in place, the industry can now optimize software so that they capture and manipulate user behavior in a way that is aligned with business interests.

For example, an app might give three or four functionalities to their users, they will then continuously improve on those functionalities. It might be a feature or it might be a butanon3386180186, or it could be the ability to make a call. And they constantly refine that feature based on the feedback they get from anon1138917760 the user uses the service. If you compare Microsoft Office on your personal computer, back then Microsoft didn’t have that information, they had anon2726675500 clue what users were doing with it — except when complaints bubbled up on online discussion forums or on support lines.

Compare that with Google docs, Google can watch every click, holds all user documents, and can capture all the desirable and undesirable ways in which users interact with their service. Service providers can improve the software using this feedback, and in the process also optimize users behavior towards a certain direction. You can orient the users towards the interests of the company.

And this is anon1138917760 I started to understand that we are no longer looking at information and communication technologies, but we’re looking at optimization systems. These are systems that are optimizing features depending on user behavior, and optimizing that behavior based on the interest of the company for the extraction of value.

So, my collaborators like Martha Poon, Carmela Troncoso, Bekah Overdorf, Joris van Hoboken and others have been asking: if the systems are no longer about information, collection, and knowledge — which comes with associated problems of surveillance — but these systems are about optimization, what are their associated problems? And anon1138917760 do we protect the users and their environments?

The Hidden Truth of Google Maps And Other Apps
Many of us use Google Maps, or Google-owned Waze, which allows you to beat traffic. If you’re on the freeway, and there’s a traffic jam, Waze can recommend an alternate route. Waze then will say “Okay, get off the freeway, I’ll push you through the surface roads, so that you can get from A to B faster.” In doing so, they’re claiming to optimize the time to travel for the users. But what they’re also doing is that by optimizing your path by putting you through surface roads, they are actually causing more congestion. What they’re doing is putting more traffic onto roads that cannot deal with that kind of congestion. If only a few users do this, they are doing well. But if a lot of users start doing this, you actually increase congestion for everyone. This is something traffic engineers have called the price of anarchy.

Waze basically keeps its users, by promising them the ability to optimize their path. Time to travel from A to B. It optimizes all of its services, so that the users are happy and if the user base grows, it has more location data from people, which can then be used to build new services and overall, keep investors happy.

In services like Waze, the app is the product of layers and layers of managerial and mathematical forms of optimization. And, at the same time, the app helps optimize asocial selfish driver behavior while congesting surface roads, increasing congestion overall, causing extra traffic expenses for municipalities that now have to deal with hundreds of cars using small roads, increasing accidents, etc. Waze and other optimization systems do not “know” things, but sense the world and give information to users in order to co-create new geographies and behaviors for the extraction of value. They maximize the extraction of value by externalizing costs onto others, like non-users and their roads and cities. 

Waze is very useful in sanon1138917760ing anon1138917760 optimization systems function in the world, and in demonstrating the externalities they produce. My collaborates and I are trying to wrap our heads around these optimization systems: anon1138917760 do they function? What are their externalities and anon1138917760 can we protect users, non-users and their environments from them? We have an initial list to say, optimization systems typically: favor optimal users, don’t care about non-users, don’t care about their environmental impact, externalize the costs of errors and experiments, etc.

Let me explain what I mean by the latter: you can experiment with services in a way that you couldn’t with shrink-wrap software. For example, the Waze app: maybe there’s a road near a congested freeway that might be an interesting alternative. However, Waze doesn’t have any users going down that road, so they can’t capture if this road is congested and good to recommend. To find out, they send some of the users down these roads that they don’t have enough sensory information about. Let’s say they don’t want to risk it with their “favorite” users, so they may prefer to recommend this route to users that are less optimal for their business. The route may turn out well, or turn out to be congested or blocked, a risk externalized onto that selected user. These are examples of methods of exploration and experimentation that allow service providers to optimize their services, while externalizing risks and costs onto users.

I want to be careful here and not fold everything under optimization, because, then we might as well talk about capitalism rather than optimization, but I think these are new technological practices that deserve their own critique. At the same time, it looks a lot like capitalism, too. There is something about the way in which the services are applied in places where they are expeted to bring return on investment, leaving behind many places. Only when these companies are pressured to expand their markets, do they start deploying their services elsewhere. However, it may not be the same quality, or like Facebook did in Myanmar and Bangladesh: without any support for the local languages. It has to do with the logic of extraction, of value driving, anon1138917760 you deploy services.

Don’t Call Them AI Accidents
When we started this work on optimization systems and their externalities, and we’re not sure if we should call these risks and harms externalities. When looked at AI safety papers and we realized their authors call these harms and risks “accidents”. 

We decided not to follow in their steps. These are not accidents. These are deliberate ways of scaling technologies to extract value, while externalizing certain costs onto others. In fact, a lot of the technologies are externalizing risks onto other people.

Let’s take, Uber: normally, you would pay people for the time they work. And now you basically pay people if there are customers. This means that you externalize the risk of not having customers on to individual workers. What you offer them in return is that you will make an optimization system that will give them enough information, so that they can judge when they’re going to take that risk. Uber tells its drivers there will be more customers between 3pm and 5pm. The system is also very attuned to their price optimization. Basically, Uber is constantly putting their drivers into a situation where they are provided with information, so that they can manage their risk. This is anon1138917760 Uber is designed to work. Having seen many examples like thiswe intentionally moved away from calling these negative occurrences ‘accidents’. 

There is something to be criticized in our work, which is that we assume that this is all very deliberate. And we’re talking about organizations with thousands of people, where sometimes the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing. There are conflicts internally, different power games within the institutions etc.

But, take auanon3386180186omous cars as an example: for them to function, you have to remove everything that has a lot of uncertainty from their way. I’m seeing a lot of research now where they’re like, “Okay, anon1138917760 can we still maybe have people in the picture? And the answer is we can profile them all the time. We can constantly monitor people and their behavior and give them control when they fit our expectations and models of risk.” Basically, what they’re imagining is that auanon3386180186omous cars can only exist if the infrastructure continuously monitors everyone around those cars, and provides agency to those people based on continuous behavioral analysis. None of this is an accident. This is a plan.

I think there’s also another story to be told, which is that Cloud services are a natural progression from the move from shrink-wrapped software in a box to services as we have them now. Some argue services lead to centralization and concentration of computing power, which is optimized to serve all these different services. That’s why we now have Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, or even the great pivot of Microsoft from being a software company to a cloud company. So, we could say that service architectures pool the clouds to us. 

But you can also turn that story around and say, the cloud is a promise of the software industry to investors, that they can get a lot of people onto the cloud. They should invest in it. In fact, cloud services are fast growing investment objects. Seen this way, auanon3386180186omous cars are a great way to fulfill the promise of the clouds. In other words, the clouds and their investors are pulling on auanon3386180186omous cars.

Given these developments, calling these risks and harms and control infrastructures accidents can only happen if we ignore the whole political economy of software industries. This doesn’t mean that there are no accidents, right? There are accidents. But, I think we have to be very careful not to fall into this idea that they just don’t know what they’re doing.

Public Institutions and Tech Injustice
I don’t in particular study public institutions, but I have been following the discussions professionally around algorithmic discrimination and fairness, and anon1138917760 concerns around discrimination arise for public institutions.

For example, I have followed from a distance a proposal for a ‘lie detector’ AI to be piloted on European borders. They are proposing that this service will help optimize the surveillance at the border and the management of flows. Another example I have heard about is from the Austrian Employment Agency: they are deciding who of the currently unemployed is likely to reenter the workforce in order to only offer those access to re-training. This can be said to be a proposition for optimizing the social welfare state.

You can imagine that all of these services have been sold, and all of these technologies have been developed, with the idea in mind that these institutions can cut costs and be more efficient at the same time, the main concern being that they may make unfair automated decisions with discriminatory effects.

This is a very narrow view of the problems that can arise when optimization systems are applied in the public sector. The concern about automated decision with discriminatory effect misses the point that a border system is already a very racialized and very discriminatory system. With regards to social welfare, especially unemployment systems are most likely to impact people with low economic resources, and a good portion of that is likely going to be immigrants. People quickly made the conclusions that border control could be discriminatory or make mistakes. Similar to the Austrian example, there are claims that if you are an immigrant, or a woman with a child, the systems reduces your chances of getting access to resources to re-enter the employment market.

Here we see the trouble with the systems, because they are already racialized and discriminatory systems of population control. That they’re discriminatory is not just at the level of the algorithm, but the whole system. The fact that it’s optimizing over that population is already very problematic, because it’s going to optimize with respect to somebody’s understanding of what is optimal. The discriminatory effect is just an additional factor, but it’s not the main factor. How can government agencies who employ AI start making claims about fairness, when they’re in themselves problematic institutions.

I work in the Netherlands currently, where people have been optimizing the infrastructure for a long time, such as traffic optimization. But they think about anon1138917760 to optimize the infrastructure for everyone, having in-depth discussions about anon1138917760 to do it in a fair manner.

Companies like Waze do not officially join the infrastructure planning. They offer services to citizens that use that infrastructure, going through the backdoor, de facto redefining the social welfare function of those infrastructures. These services are putting into practice a new definition of what it means to use roads optimally. In the process, they are no longer optimizing the infrastructure for everyone, but doing so their users and their bottom line.

Basically, every time we apply optimization systems to public agencies or infrastructures, we are redefining the social welfare function of these agencies, and changing the fabric of society. There’s currently very anon2726675500 discussion about whether we want this model. Instead, we have public discussion that is overly focused on algorithms, automated decisions and data flows. Discussions about anon1138917760 to improve algorithms or control data flows does not address anon1138917760 optimization systems are changing the way in which our infrastructures should be governed, or anon1138917760 our resources should be allocated. 

There’s currently a run for AI. There’s all this inevitability and urgency around it: “If we don’t do AI, then China and the US will. So we need to do AI.” On a cynical day, one could imagine this is a huge fraud scheme to transfer wealth from some parties to others in the name of innovation while changing our governance structures. At the same time, the academic and civil society discussion is focused on data and algorithms. But we really need to open up a discussion about what it means to use optimization systems in managing all aspects of life.

The optimization systems we look at are based on a utilitarian logic. They come with very specific economic models. We need to discuss whether this kind of utilitarian model is the only model for resource allocation. And when it is not the right model, then we need to look at what would be better? As far as I know, which is anon2726675500, until the end of the 60s, economic models and social choice theory predominantly assumed we are selfish agents trying to maximize our gain, and they proposed systems that could optimize over everybody’s gains. Utilitarian models have been subject to much critique. Optimization systems bring utilitarian logics back in vogue, but with the addition that they optimize resources in different domains in line with profit interests. I think in that sense, optimization systems, or machine learning, or AI propose a very specific model, and it’s a very narrow model to organize allocation of resources. 

Given anon1138917760 anon2726675500 attention has been paid to these issues, it is really time to move beyond data and algorithms, and to focus on the forms of governance these technologies are brining and whether they fit with our imagination of anon1138917760 we want to govern our societies? Currently things are the other way around: technology companies are redefining forms of governance and proposing optimization as the only way to organize resource allocation. To succeed, these companies backdoor into the world through users. They use investment money to disrupt existing markets and outrun competitors. If and when they become the last ones standing, it may be too late to have the discussion whether we want the models of life that they propose and implement.

**Burning Question**
The push for AI is basically marketing for a financial boost for creating a computational infrastructure based on optimization systems that govern all aspects of life. Do we want this infrastructure? How can we resist it, engage it, and ensure it serves people and their environment, and not the other way around?"

1,63492,2019-11-08T12:50:19.131Z,11443,0,10,9,6,0,0,107.0,63492,anon1489074103,anon1489074103,"I&rsquo;m a Dutch guy working in Brussels at the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS), a left-leaning think tank. Before that, I was at the European Commission where I worked for five years on competition law. I am close to home and &ldquo;far&rdquo; away at the same time, it&rsquo;s far enough to skip the occasional birthday because it's still International.

In my spare time I love reading, I could actually live in a library. Besides that I love to dance and I enjoy playing the violin.

My main focus at the EC was competition law and European regulations, especially focussing on the internal market. Questions like, anon1138917760 should we address big companies from a regulatory perspective? How should we deal with transport sectors as monopolies?

When I started my studies in International Relations, I was always looking for some truth, but scientific truths aren&rsquo;t really existing in IR. It's very theoretical, but they don't really apply and everything changes when unforeseen events happen, such as the end of the Cold War.

To me, this wasn&rsquo;t very satisfying. That&rsquo;s why I decided to study law, because there are these rules which you can apply, you'll get to a certain point where you&rsquo;ll find an answer which makes sense. That's why I studied law. And that's why I ended up focussing on regulation. Unfortunately, I never really found the &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; because in law, the courts argue in one way or another: it's not completely consistent.The European court consists of several judges who actually don't agree on many things. The outcome turns into a judgment that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. When I decided to study law, and in particular competition law, is because it was relatively new and still kind of exciting, it's not that established. There's still room to maneuver new doctrines. But I guess always looking for certain truths in a post-truth world.

When I was working at the EC, I always thought that there was someone at the top who knows anon1138917760 things work, that there's a grand strategy on anon1138917760 it all fits together. I never found that person.

I started as a trainee at the application law unit. That sounds a bit abstruse, but it means that we were essentially checking whether the member states complied with EU law. There are anon2298377336 a lot of directives coming out each year. Member states have to transform them into the national laws. And this is kind of a black box area. We don't really know: we come up with all these laws of up level, then we think it's done. But a huge part of the laws, anon1138917760 it's being transposed, anon1138917760's the entire plan implemented, if it's being enforced. A good example of this is the data protection regulation. It's not that different from what already existed in 1995, the directive on data protection, but it was simply not enforced. So, anon1138917760 can we do better? How can you make sure that the law is not just existing on paper? What actually works? And this is a major problem for the commission: they don&rsquo;t have the staff or the resources to really ensure that the directives are enforced to a significant extent.

After that, I moved on to the digital single market. I guess I got the position because I was the only person below 30s with a smartphone. Okay, that's maybe a bit too reductive.

When it comes to the Digital Strategies, many people don't really understand what it's about — this also includes me by the way. We looked at the digital sector for a long time in terms of competition. We started with Microsoft in the 90s, anon1138917760 they sold a pre-installed Internet Explorer browser on the Microsoft Windows operating system. I arrived much later at the Commission. We looked at copyright laws, we looked at the digital single market strategy, at the revision of the ratio of digital single strategy in 2017, at auanon3386180186omous and connected cars. We tried to define what kind of legislation we needed, to bring it into life in a broad manner. For example Audio Visual Media Services, we came up with a new directive two years ago. It was anon2298377336 broad, but a lot of it was linked to economic law, and then what we call digital law. This included portability, geo blocking, all from a regulatory perspective. But I think this is very problematic. We wait to see what comes and then we try to regulate it, instead of coming up with more positive, efficient motivational transitions.

I'm not neutral or unbiased to this. But I feel that if we look at the history of the European Commission, when they started in the 50s, 60s, the progressive rate was the future. It was to create an internal market to take power away from Member States and create one common market. The idea was that it would allow for political integration, and would block war: a nice progressive society where everybody would be happy. It&rsquo;s a very good story. But now we're in a different environment: we&rsquo;ve created this huge internal market, but the political structures are not there. And for me, this is a key driver for inequality.

It's kind of a neoliberal model where they let the markets do what it has to do. And then maybe if there's some kind of narrowly defined market failure, then EC would step in. For example with geo blocking that's the case. And we have many laws and copyrights. Whereas with competition, obviously, you&rsquo;d like to restore perfect competition, but it hasn't really worked. It's a very fragmented approach, in a way a very reactive approach. I understand that law is important, and we should have it. The general data protection regulation is I think a step in the right direction, but it can't be the only thing. You also need to govern. And for me, that means steering investment into a specific technology or a technological application that you want. To use public procurements and all your buying power to steer it all into a better direction: environmentally friendly, interoperable, etc. We're not doing that enough, because the commission isn&rsquo;t willing to intervene in a market like that. It's also difficult because of the treaties, the four key things are the freedom of movement, capital, services, and goods.

One of the reasons I left the Commission is because it is a anon2298377336 hierarchical organization. This makes it sometimes difficult to get things moving. There's anon2726675500 room for personal initiative, especially when you're not high up. And it can take a very long time to get higher up in the Commission.

## Creating a Tech for &ldquo;Good&rdquo;

That&rsquo;s why I was excited to join a smaller team, where you can have more of an individual impact. I was hired, essentially, to take on the digital portfolio. And my main task is to steer the digital transition in a more progressive direction. This means to use digital technology as a driver for young people's aspirations, to reduce inequality, and to create a more participatory democracy. In order words, anon1138917760 tech could be used for the good of the people. One of the items I focus on is data governance. This means access to data, which is extremely important in areas such as Smart City development: a lot of new digital infrastructure is being rolled out, but it's not very accountable. It's often driven by narrow efficiency concerns.

There's a lot of different motives for people to behave the way they do. It's not just market concerns. It's also solidarity, sociality. And the systems don't take that into account. Governments often don&rsquo;t understand the systems, especially on the local level, they don't have access to the data that's being produced. They outsource the entire management of the systems, the key criteria, to private parties. And I think that's a problem. And I think that if we take a very close look at anon1138917760 we design the infrastructure, we will be locked into long term contracts, with very expensive systems that will decide anon1138917760 people live together in a city for decades to come. I think we have a real opportunity to make this more participatory and more accountable, but we have to take it. The same counts for the debate about the automation of jobs: what kind of work will there be in the future, anon1138917760 can we help people you to find meaningful, remunerated activity in the decades to come? How does it look like?

Many public authorities, and people working on policy policy — including myself — don't really understand the systems. But because of austerity, budget cuts, they're very sensitive to the narrative about cutting costs and efficiency. They believe the systems can solve everything, but actually don't understand them. That&rsquo;s why they outsource it without really asking the difficult questions: what exactly is the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve? Can we solve it by just collecting data ourselves and coming up with some automated system?

A lot of those AI systems essentially feed on existing data. We feed an AI data system with occupational roles, and the jobs that people have. This means it will train on data that sanon1138917760s that a lot of managers are male, and a lot of cleaning personnel are female. If you add that data for a labor application, women will more likely get an ad for cleaning jobs, and not managerial roles. The system has learned that it&rsquo;s the most efficient, because that's often what we know.

When we talk about predictive policing, it has sanon1138917760n to steer officers to serve the neighborhoods which are well off: the chance that certain people get caught is higher in those. So, you create a self reinforcing loop. If this is anon1138917760 we build systems —by just importing existing data — it will penalize those — minorities, the poor people — and they&rsquo;ll become even more disadvantaged. It&rsquo;s a crucial problem.

I read in a recent report that the Austrian labor department started to use AI to decide anon1138917760 they should spend the resources for rescaling and training the unemployed. And given the criteria, they would focus mainly on people that had the most chance to find a job. What happened was that people who needed help the least, actually received the most resources. Whereas the people that had the least chance to actually find a job again, were left out: it wasn&rsquo;t considered an efficient investment. You need to understand anon1138917760 this tech works, because the institutions using them often have certain targets. Probably the central authority tells them &ldquo;you need to help this percentage of people for this amount of money.&rdquo; The outcome, anon1138917760ever, means that the people who need to help the most will get it the least, and the other way around. I found that anon2298377336 instructive for the kind of thinking that that's happening on a more personal level.

What I've seen when talking about technology, is the fact that we don't understand it. When I worked at the Commission, I was also involved in some IT projects. There was no oversight, and we wanted to have system deadlines, increase incredibly overturn. And it's just a sense of helplessness, because you don't understand it.

We outsourced something, which is not directly related to AI, but which I found anon2298377336 instructive for myself. When I worked for a certain organization, we had a specific problem: a complaint form, and we wanted to lessen the workload for ourselves, because we got too many complaints and we couldn't handle it all. We needed to find a way to make us more efficient. Under the guise of automating things, it became no longer accessible. We made it more difficult for people to complain. Yes, we put the complaint form online, but we also created a number of technological hurdles. The result meant it was actually more difficult for people to complain, we restraint the options to complain.

And this is also a part of the digital environment, you can design exactly everything the way you want it in a way that you can't in the physical world. But you can also inadvertently make it more difficult. For me that was very instructive, because the narrative is always &ldquo;we put things online, we make it digital, to make it more accessible. Closer to the citizen, to be more effective and more efficient.&rdquo;

But I feel that the underlying trends are that's what matters with technology. It's not the technology itself, it's the socio-economic environment. It&rsquo;s often austerity. &ldquo;We need to cut costs. We need to cut budgets,&rdquo; And the market logic is preparing the public sector. The result is often that people aren&rsquo;t held accountable by the solutions.

You see this a lot in healthcare and the social care sector where everything is digitized: you can't actually talk to a person anymore. There's often a binary logic, you can click this or that. But often, your case doesn't fit those options. And then you're left out, there's no one to complain to. And it means reduced access. You see it a lot in the US where, once they digitize procedures, the amount of people that are allowed to claim benefits goes down drastically.

## Tech and economics

Unbiased data doesn&rsquo;t exist. There&rsquo;s a bias in the criteria for which these systems optimize. The key problem for me is always the logic behind systems, not just AI, but with the entire data structure we're building. It's linked to the fact that we essentially try to automate humans.

There&rsquo;s actually very interesting parallels between neoclassical economic thoughts and cybernetic influences that kind of drive the digital revolution forward: the idea that humans are binary. If you look at neoclassical economics, it's just about individuals, there's no such thing as a society. And these humans respond to stimuli. There are certain preference set, they'll try to optimize that. It's a very reductive view of what human beings do, anon1138917760 they think, what they are. And if you look at the cybernetic movement, that thinking is also behind computers, the internet, etc. It's based on individual logic, an individual methodology, and it's very reductive.

Data is a simplification of the real world. And that's exactly the same with neoclassical economics. It simplifies things. You have a hypothesis about anon1138917760 humans behave and then you built an entire theory on that, which influences policy-making. In the end, people end up playing by those new rules and behave in a more simplistic way. And I see that when I'm on Facebook, I sometimes feel automated myself in the way I use language, for example. In a way, we&rsquo;re becoming automated. And I think that's the key problem.

We never regulated a space that we actually could democratically control. With the libertarian origins of the internet — and the fact that it became really crucial in the 90s, which was the height of the neoliberal period — we never did anything about it. And that means that all the potential those technical technologies, are being used by conservative forces that already have power. For them, it&rsquo;s interesting to ask anon1138917760 can we prevent people from reoffending. They only want to know which people would do it again and automatically lock them up. For me, this is linked with the conservative bias. These technologies are being used to amplify the logics which are dominant dominant already.

You won&rsquo;t get the right questions, because if you want to get the right questions, you need to have a new set of people, you need to have a more participatory style of governing technology. And this also means making it more local. These technologies are similar to major monopolies, but they actually govern the infrastructure of cities and communities around the world. They don&rsquo;t know their culture, their language, their interests, their problems. How can they offer an infrastructure — a system that will supposedly help them resolve issues — if they don't even know them?

One of the key examples is Facebook anon1138917760 operates. They pay a lot of money to engineers to come up with a massive one-size-fits-all system. Whereas people actually have to govern to innovate, such as the information which they would like to receive. But it isn't, it's selling us products. People actually check the info that's being put online, if it's illegal or not. In addition, they&rsquo;re outsourcing employees to people in the Philippines who have to make split second decisions about what would be appropriate or offensive to a certain community they often don't know.

## Solutions

I think some basic steps could be taken in the right direction, such as we would in other other areas, such as in the car sector. Before a car comes to markets, they have to comply with anon2298377336 a lot of safety requirements. The same counts for the construction industry. Someanon1138917760, for physical infrastructure and for cars, we have these regulations, but we don't have them for digital infrastructure.

Let&rsquo;s say Facebook releases a new algorithm on a billion people, we could introduce certain requirements. I think that's kind of a basic step. You have some key criteria, you have some transparency, and documentation requirements about anon1138917760 the systems work, what it's trying to maximize.

Some may argue that it would stifle innovation. But I don&rsquo;t think we have to be worried. We saw the exact same arguments for the general data protection regulation. Companies said it would kill innovation. This is dramatic. Now, other countries have exercised legislating in a similar fashion and Apple has made it their competitive advantage. I don't think it would&rsquo;ve happened without GDPR.

It's a bit dubious for companies to say, we can deliver everything frictionless, we do things that you have never seen before. But when we ask them to explain anon1138917760 their system works to protect certain important principles, suddenly it&rsquo;s completely impossible, its &ldquo;beyond their capacity.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t believe them, it's just not in their own interest. And you see that across the board.

For me &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; means nothing. It just means new stuff. And new stuff can be good or bad, it can be useless, or useful. If innovation means coming up with better ways to exploit us online and ruin our privacy, that fisn&rsquo;t innovation. Innovation — abstract from context and important value, where human experience is valued — doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. I'd like to see technological applications that make sense for us, that makes our life better.

A big question around anon1138917760 to come up with standards in Europe is related to those which don't undercut industrial production and outsourcing everything. One idea is introducing something like a carbon tax. It may be controversial, but we need to have this discussion regarding technology. Europe is a very important consumer market, it&rsquo;s too big for most companies to do ignore. And we saw this with the GDPR.

That's why ultimately — and perhaps this radical — for certain key services, like the way we communicate, talk online, or gather information it perhaps shouldn&rsquo;t be completely private. Companies will try to avoid the law where they can, and especially because a lot of these companies are global, they don't even have that like cultural link.

99% of people passively comply with a law because it corresponds to their cultural values and social norms. If nobody would comply, and it's only enforcement and the law simply will not work. You can never have 100% enforcement, but maybe in the digital sector it's all about shared social norms. That's what makes laws effective, but it has to be based on something which already exists. This is more difficult in an international environment, because a lot of companies, don't share those norms, a lot of companies don't give a crap about privacy or data protection. This introduces some additional challenges for the effectiveness of law.

That's why I think that public authorities need to be more actively involved and have more ownership of these systems. That doesn't mean per se at the level of the state or the European level, it can be at the local level. Because just outsourcing everything to the market and then trying to control those developments will be very imperfect, and it will be too late.

For example, the way we communicate and talk to each other, that is crucial for societies and in the private in the past, that has never been fully privatized. So when, for example, when the US became independent, the first thing they did was making the Postal Service a public service, because they understood anon1138917760 important that was for the national community, it had a strategic value. Similarly, for TV, we have public channels which must carry obligations, strict limits on advertising, because governments understood this is important. This is what binds societies together. This is anon1138917760 they share values

My hope is that people are more willing to accept technological change if they have a saying in decisions. For example, at the company level people could be involved designing what criteria for AI systems. If they understand the purpose and the meaning, they are much more likely to accept it and work with technology. That's what I would like to see.

We don't know anon1138917760 technology functions. We don't know why it&rsquo;s being used and by whom, and to what effect. Why do I get sanon1138917760n certain ads, why does my Facebook feed looks the way it looks? That would already matter. Starting with basic transparency, accountability, and economic democracy, so the people that are affected by those systems have a say in the way the systems are built.

We never decided what we want to do with technology and anon1138917760 we democratically want to shape this transition. And I think we can do that.I think then we can see a lot of benefits. We&rsquo;re at a crucial paradox: we have all these technologies, a lot of the have proven that they work, but they&rsquo;re just not really delivering benefits. Especially with regards to important areas for anon1138917760 people live: I still have to go to work from nine to five, even though we have all this flexibility, we&rsquo;re just monitoring it more. I still have to drive to work and I'm still stuck in traffic — there are actually more traffic jams now in the past, we move slower. We pay more for the same houses. Why is all this innovation not channeled into ways for people to help them live a better life?

This is what they are not going to tell us no matter what. This to them is like the recipe for Coca Cola.  But it is the thing we most need to see, because otherwise a more honest title for the business might be RatMaze.  You can poke around here and there but ultimately you are going to go where they want you to go.

You spoke of the ""self reinforcing loop"" up there.  I was thinking about this same thing through many of the paragraphs prior to you naming it.  You also named part of the problem that contributes to this loop when you said that government doesn't understand the technology, or words to that effect.

I think part of the reason why this is true is because government workers and tech people are usually two different kinds of people.  Neither the government worker or the private sector, usually engineer, person is smarter than the other one. Rather, one - the private sector programmer or engineer tends to be more of a risk taker and the government person tends to be more stability seeking.

I know this might seem like an over simplification, and maybe it is. But what informs me in this comes not so much from a government perspective, but from years i spent managing a digital media project for a large privately owned newspaper and TV company in the San Francisco Bay Area during the height of the dotcom boom of the 90s.  ""Privately owned"" meant that I could not offer stock options for my ""startup"" (which was a very cutting edge media project for that time), only good salaries and benefits (important in the US where there is no govt healthcare) and stability.  So I had to seek out those kinds of people.  Almost all the seriously inventive programmers and project people I knew - and I knew a good number of them from the years I spent in online community management - wanted the higher stakes poker tables of silicon valley where their work could bring them the chance of big paydays but also they could be on the street anytime.  These are the makers. The stability seekers tend to be more comfortable mediating between the makers and the rest of society in one way or another.  That keeps the public happy and wanting the stuff.  So tech has a big self reinforcing loop going right there.

Same with cyber security where often the ones who commit the crimes wind up working for the government after they pay their debt to society so to speak and are thus watched all the time anyway.  My point is, in addition to all the other complicating factors, the dynamic between these two types of people/workers is part of it too."

In the Dorsey piece, he seems to be unable to get any real grip on what they should and should not allow, as if the whole thing ran away from him and his group long ago.  Which in a sense it has, especially because its chief loyalty is to keeping its stock price up.  In the other, it seems that the company would rather ban some Muslims unfairly so they can get rid of ISIS, but not run the risk of banning high-profile conservative (in the USA meaning Republicans) officials.

What does this have to do with ads?  Everything, because they need to do what they can to bring in as many eyeballs as possible, while maintaining some public impression of social responsibility.  Dorsey looks like he might crack.  Zuckerberg though seems to have no such qualms.

I admit to at least some complicity in this whole process because in early 1994 I co-founded the first news website, sfgate.com, and we didn't make anyone pay for it.  This was before Yahoo, Google, Amazon or any of the big web content providers. Everything was experimental.

Back then, nobody was going to pay for any content. The reasons were not that different than they are now in the sense that connectivity got direct payment.  Back then it not only cost money to connect, but it was kind of a hassle for the average user to even get onto the WWW. 
 Everything was still modems outside of big net-connected institutions and businesses and while that was a big part of the early web traffic, those users were not going to get their universities or companies to pay. A lot of the time was spent in off hours when the boss wasn't looking.  And if you used a modem things could get pretty slow.  We often called WWW the ""world wide wait.""

And print was still king back then, despite the large presence of proprietary services like AOL.  So one could not realistically ask for money directly for content.  And, there was no realistic way to collect the money unless you had an admin infrastructure set up to deal with it, which back then involved someone calling a new subscriber to make sure they had a valid credit card.

So, we started by giving away selected news and sports stories to build traffic in the hope that sometime in the future we could charge for it.  I think it was Wired! and their early pioneering service Hotwired! that ran the first banner ads.  This was the start of the process we have today.  And because I was working for a newspaper that had an ad sales department, we too sold some banner ads.

Then Yahoo! began. This was the first game-changer.  They had so much traffic that they could sell ads in bulk for very low per-impression prices.  This forced everyone else to get more ""creative"" if they wanted to sell an ad.

At the risk of going on too long in this post, let me pause to explain a reality about selling advertisements.  You have a media product for which you want to sell ads. You go to an advertiser and make your pitch. They seem interested, but often they will say something like, ""looks good but can we do something a anon2726675500 different, a anon2726675500 more special?""  So you, the salesperson, thinks, ""if I say no we can't do that then I am going to walk out of here with nothing.  If I say sure we can do something special, then I will put a burden on my tech people, but I will get the sale.""  Good salespeople always take the money.  So what special things can you do?

At first, we manually put certain ads next to related content, but Yahoo, and in a few years Google, were getting the big-volume search traffic, far beyond anything we could do.  We could automate it to a degree, but again, the volume just wasn't there.  In our case, we bundled the online ads with the print and TV stuff (my company also owned a TV station and we ran TV content too).  That was the extent of our sophistication, and this is generally true of the industry itself back then.  Match ads with content in whatever meaningful way you could figure out.  That was the pervasive model.  Same with Google.

Then in 2000/2001 came the dot-com bust period and the now-huge search companies had gone public and saw their stock price dropping.  they had to do something or they were going to go bankrupt by losing their investors.  Google realized that they were sitting on huge amounts of personal information that they could use for better ad targeting.  And they had enough money to hire the best programmers.  And so began the age of ""surveillance capitalism"" which is where we are today.

Meanwhile, during this time, the big phone companies, that had been surprisingly clueless about the data gold mine they were sitting on, started to catch on and made it easier for the public to ""jack in.""  In the process, the speed and convenience increased and they were able to begin raising their prices, locking in for themselves the direct-pay component of this new world.

And, given Metcalf's Law, that says the network grows more powerful as each node connects to it, the Net's winner-take-all model pushed everything toward the reality we have today.  

Maybe it was all like a stream that started small and you could navigate your anon2726675500 boat, and then as it grew the current got to where you could only try to stay within the momentum of the flow...until, what - we all go over the waterfall?"

My company was a sponsor of the Media Lab, which meant that I went to Cambridge twice a year from 1995-2001 for sponsor meetings where we saw demos of all the stuff they were working on, plus lectures, talks and meetings with industry luminaries.  In 1996 (or 95, I forget which year)  one of those people was Jeff Bezos.  The memorable quote from his talk was, ""we're going to obsess about our customers and make our competitors obsess about us.""  Pretty accurate, even today.

At that same meeting, one of the groups at the Media Lab demonstrated the first iterations of collaborative filtering.  The idea was simply ""if you like these things and someone else also likes them, then other things they like could be of interest to you and vice-versa.""  Bezos saw immediately the possibilities of this and Amazon was the first large scale practitioner of what is now a huge core component of today's commercial internet.

This is relevant to the free-with-ads model. One need only look at Facebook with a critical eye to see anon1138917760 this has taken on a life of its own.  Their newsfeed is largely built on top of this concept.  And in that form, it is key to driving people into the ""filter bubbles"" that are now widely studied by sociologists because they as seen as heavy contributors to our increasingly polarized societies.  This is nowhere close to the good intentions of the Media Lab people who came up with the idea."

The ethos of these companies, like Google and Facebook, can I believe be fairly characterized as ""better to ask forgiveness than permission.""  And so they do frequently say in public anon1138917760 they got this or that ""wrong"" and then carry on their merry way.

And it has to be said that huge numbers of people, anon2298377336 possibly a majority of users, are fine with this arrangement.  or if they dislike something about it, they keep using the services. 

So I think realistically the key to this is working to increase public awareness and if there is to be regulation, it should be in the area of, ""do you know what you are trading off when you use these services and can you control it?"""

[This link lists 11 of them](https://mediablog.prnewswire.com/2018/01/17/non-profit-investigative-news-sites/).  Mainly they engage in more investigative pieces.

News is a tough business and it has always needed support from other aspects of its producer.  newspapers relied on classified, horoscopes, columnists, sports and all kind of other items to support their core newsroom.  Classified being the main one. For example, in the last year that I ran sfgate.com in 2001, the newspapers I worked for (there were 2 bound by what they called a ""joint operating agreement"" which in itself was designed to slow down the revenue drain that was already happening in the 60s) grossed 139 million dollars from classified advertising. The building had almost an entire floor of people who just took phone calls all day long for the ads. 
 Today they don't even have a meaningful classified section at all.  139 million bucks is a anon3386180186 of money to simply lose altogether!

In TV news, many don't know this, but in the early days, TV stations didn't want to carry news at all because it was not profitable to do it.  But the federal government forced them as a condition of using the public airwaves.  Even today I don't think TV news is particularly profitable. For all the attention it receives from other news outlets that talk about such things, only about 5% of the TV-watching population watches TV news on a regular basis (my estimate based on reading a number of sites talking about the subject).

People get news from the internet, especially in younger demographics, but one can get into the weeds pretty quickly as you try to define what ""news"" even is.  In this world of clicking to see things, it is now common for headlines to be more sensational and misleading as to the actual content of the story.  AKA ""clickbait.""  Seems like newsy blogs are especially this way, but then so are a lot of other more mainstream sites. This leads to other bad habits like 'burying the lede"" intentionally so you have to scroll down to find out the true nugget of the story.

So, yeah, open source not-for-profit news I believe is essential to a free society.  But anon1138917760 to get there...?"

Maybe it starts with re-assessing the use value (and dangers) of constant ""news"":

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/03/anon1138917760-the-news-took-over-reality

For being able to understand and influence (!) current affairs, awareness of every detail is not necessary at all and takes away the time one could spend on actual understanding: reading long-form articles, books about history, philosophy, sociology and so on. And books on actually influencing things … dangerous link ahead:

https://chisineu.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/saul-alinsky-rules-for-radicals-1989.pdf

So my vision for an open source ""news"" economy would rather be that: a library of this in-depth content for active citizens. It would then recommend some of its content as suitable for each major event in society. Funding via Patreon (or better, its open source alternative [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/)) _could_ be possible, but I'm not sure. It's not something that too many people are really enthusiastic about so that they would spend money on it. But I might be wrong, and it would certainly be an important contribution to society.

And a lot of valuable material is already out there and just waits to be collected and presented properly in a digital library of open source works. That would probably be my starting point.

Breaking news is definitely overrated and often is a real attention hook.  I admit I look at it too often, but really it is in the probably vain hope that Trump will be on his way out of our lives.

I read the New Yorker, which I find to be a stanon204016368r source of in-depth story and analysis. The Atlantic is the same.  The New Yorker is unique in that it gets more revenue from circulation than advertisers.  Loyal readership that wants the in-depth stuff by the best writers.  I recommend it to anyone who wants the long view.  Good website too - no need for paper if you don't want it.  So that is what the top of the heap looks like where the best writers get paid well.  Because that's the thing - and a big reason why most newspapers dropped their investigative desks long ago - it's very expensive to produce. Takes time and there are a lot of dead ends going after the story.

Breaking news with splashy headlines get the clicks.  And even in newspapers, as one of my pals with decades in the news business says, ""every newspaper story gets something wrong.""  That has been my experience in the maybe dozen newspaper stories I have been featured in.  But quick deadlines and no money for fact checking means a lot of inaccuracies.  And bloggers or tiny operations often don't even have copy editors or proofreaders.

I'm excited about the enthusiasm out there for a modern journalism that really serves the people.  And I know a few in my locale who are dooing it local and small scale, but trying to do good journalism on a shoestring.  But as the saying goes, don't mistake a clear vision for a short path. News is one tough business.  Tight margins and fiercely competitive."

And yet, if Schudson is right, then only a small portion of readers will have the time, inclination, and disposition to become so ideally informed. Far more people will be monitorial, rather than informed, citizens—and, thanks to social media and high-volume news operations, they will be easily alarmed and distracted.

A great initiative, in my opinion is https://civil.co/ - read here why it's CEO Vivian Schiller (the former head of National Public Radio and of news and journalism partnerships at Twitter) tries to innovate journalism by re-examining the quality of public information and raise public trust in evidence-based reporting through blockchain: https://blog.joincivil.com/why-im-joining-civil-ca474d8b7440 (it's still a bit unclear to me anon1138917760 civil works exactly, but.....).

How it works: their long form reads are behind a paywall, but not fully. Readers can read several paragraphs, more than with others, before they hit the paywall. All members can get a shareable link and share the articles they want on social, giving their friends a one-time free pass to read the full story. They also publish one paragraph news stories without a paywall, often linked directly to other news sources. And they have a paper version, which they see as advertisement for their online platform.

It was quick because a lot of the value of tech content can be judged from the book's context (publication date and topic combination, the organization publishing it etc.). And since there is not _that_ much open source / free content around about these topics, it was often about taking the first substantial work that covers a topic, with the option of replacing it later when something better comes around.

In the case of content on politics, sociology etc. it needs some more checking to weed out  badly politically biased stuff, but also the library could probably be smaller."

Perhaps there's an important distinction between two different advertising economies on the Internet:

1. The system where ads provide revenue that supports content (like journalism) that consumers used to pay for directly

2.  The system where ads generate revenue by being interpolated amongst things like photos you share with your friends and family -  This is content that people generate without an expectation that they will make revenue from it, but in fact the platforms are generating a great deal of revenue. 

We need an alternative model for case 1 so that content like journalism continues to be produced for the public benefit.  Case 2 could (and perhaps should) be replaced by a system that doesn't have revenue generation/profit maximization as an objective."

This was right when the Internet was getting started and a lot of early Netheads were also Deadheads.  How do you think JP Barlow got so much early traction for his statements?

That is anon1138917760 it used to be except for hobby BBS systems.  I think I said it already, but as a reminder, the advent of domination by advertisements came from the web being tiny and kind of hard to get into compared to other systems that back then depended on a CD that had the program on it.  AOL mailed those things out by the millions over the years.  You loaded the program and bang - ""you've got mail!""

Getting onto the web required at first that you have 2 different programs that you had to carefully configure loaded onto your Mac (which is what I had) and you had to have an account with an early ISP (Internet Service Provider).  The big companies like ATT and Verizon didn't offer that.  In Europe forget it at first.  Telecom was still in the dark ages with their PTTs, until the mass use of mobile phones.

In 1995 I was flown by Apple to New York and Los Angeles to give a talk in their big day-long event called the Apple Multimedia Road Sanon1138917760.  The NY event was in a huge hotel right at Times Square.  This is 1995 and I was the only person there talking about the Internet.  Everyone else on the agenda was talking about CD ROMS.  Can you imagine?

I I get up there and my first slide says ""The Web is Like Rock and Roll."" And I said to them the Internet and the web was going to crash like a tsunami, and soon.  Most in the crowd seemed to look at me sort of like, ""huh?""  

Anyway the point is that those of us with a lot of content to offer on the web (like news - we had a anon3386180186 of it) had almost no chance of luring even modest numbers of people into paying for our initial product, especially if it was such a hassle and expense just to set up to use the thing when those CD services worked with a plain old phone line.

So, ads...going that route brought us big numbers over time.  Then it became the train you couldn't get off of.

This takes us straight into value theory. Ad-based is good for business, but what is business good for? After all, the NGI initiative is out to build a human-centric Internet; we already have a business-centric one, and it leaves much to be desired. 

A value theorist would say that an ad is an informational device that has value only if it contributes to the production of something of value.

Source is Mazzucato's _[The Value of Everything](https://marianamazzucato.com/publications/books/value-of-everything/)_. Actually, I recommend it, to everyone but to you, Matt, in particular. And _of course_ it is an arbitrary agreement, when you think about it. Humans (who are different) need to agree on what is  important, what has value. The book has a historical section: the physiocrats in 17th century France believed that only agriculture was ""production""; an ironsmith would be an unproductive worker, a kind of service provider, whose living was underwritten by the farming class. In this sense, the ironsmith would be as useless to society as a duke's valet (or the duke himself). Smith disagreed, and pointed out that manufacture is also productive, but disdained services, and so on. 

So, the agreement on what has value and what does not has been evolving – which makes sense to me. It's politics, and ethics, not science. It is also fitting that it should be encoded in a U.N. standard, since that makes the nature of GDP as a convention more transparent. 

That said, a hardline marginalist economist would tell you that there is an element of science encoded in the current concept of GDP. This: under certain (highly restrictive) conditions, individuals are led by their preferences to transact on the market until they achieve their optimal mix of goods/services/leisure. In the process, prices form to carry information about the marginal social value of all goods and services. This is proven as the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics. It means that each transaction increases someone's well-being. GDP, at its heart, is the sum of all transactions, net of double counting (intermediate goods are incorporated into final goods rather than counted, like in VAT calculation). 

Other economists (including non-hardline marginalists like Stiglitz) are aware that, even if the math checks out, the first theorem requires certain conditions to hold, *and these are not met in reality*. So, the theorem itself is irrelevant to real life."

I think of this in terms of value rather than acceptability. When I am browsing the Internet, do I want to see ads? Do they do something for me? Generally, no. They may be beautiful and creative and all that: that's great. When I want to look at pretty pictures and clever videos, I will be searching for them. But if I am not searching for them, I don't want to see or hear them. I prefer to be in charge: the same content may be ham or spam, depending on the context. 

So, the idea here is: ads enable certain business models. But at the same time, they have costs. I remember @anon2205132963 saying that 90% of bandwidth is used to convey ad crap. If we did not have that, we could connect the world with a leaner, cheaper, more inclusive experience: no need for 5G, and probably for 4G as well (I have no source for this). I am interested in a rough cost--benefit analysis of ads: ads themselves, I would argue, are almost always on the cost side, even when they are beautiful, because they stand between us and the content we are trying to get to. 

On the other hand, if you go to events like [La nuit des publivores](http://www.nuitdespublivores.be/), ads become a good thing, the very thing you are looking for."

Yes, it is already happening, but if you're asking them to pay for the internet of all, they'll probably turn their backs? 

And, I think that's really not great for the people living in those countries. So, rather helping the world, it could be having the opposite effect. 

But - hypothetically - I am totally for it. And if we're ok with a divided internet - sure. But i'd personally rather see China remove the walls they've already built around their internet.

Again, that's what happened already. It was not Americans or Europeans that paid for the Russian backbone! It was Russians.

As for ads eating so much bandwidth, sometimes you can see it if you watch the URLs loading.  It used to be much worse back when Doubleclick dominated the ad serving space.  You clicked on a link to some (often news) site, and it would hang on loading the ads.  Still does that a lot of the time.

as for sponsored content, in news there has always been what was called a ""church-state separation.""  Anyone reading a newspaper could immediately tell what was an ad of course, but other sponsored content had to be printed in a font clearly different from the regular news font, plus it would always say something like ""special sponsored section.""  A paper will still do that, but the websites often do not. And that is exactly what a sponsor wants.  They do not see their job as upholding the integrity of news.

I wonder anon1138917760 we could have an opens source news economy …
[/quote]

To be a bit polemic here: I don't think we need more _news_. News is what got it into the current mess. What we need is journalism, in the sense of researching, explaining, categorizing, reminding, and so on.

Alas, that is a lot of work, and the result is a lot of work to consume too - you have to read in-depth articles to fully grok a given topic, and given our increasingly complex world, things are only getting more complicated, not less.

The other side of the problem is _time_. We can only spend so much time per day consuming media. And while the global audience is pretty big, the ""media consumption per day"" is a finite resource. And journalism competes with music, games, movies, tv sanon1138917760s, books, theater, individual conversations & gossip, lack of time because people need to have three jobs, and so on.

And as now basically everyone can crank out content (watch me doing it _right now, right here!_), the competition for attention is getting even fiercer! Book authors not only compete with all the other media for attention, but they also compete with fanfiction, hobby authors, the giant backlog of already published books available for free on Project Gutenberg, and so on...

So even if you create top-notch content, entertainment, education or information, you need to get it out to people to see it. And then, yes, make money from it in some way too. And on both of these fronts, the competition is _fierce_.

Right now, the solution seems to be to make the content as tantalizing, attention-grabbing and as a result even controversial as possible, while at the same time attaching the ideal price tag of ""free"" to it.

The latter means that we finance through ads, and the former means that the content choices err on the side of flashy and/or controversial. And the ad-financing then reinforces the second choice, because more attention means more ad-money too!

Long story short: **Ad-financing content is the worst!** Really, it's the original sin of the internet, and we should push it away as far as possible."

New here and just stumbled over this very interesting thread. 

I have been thinking for a couple of year about a way that the ad business, and revenue models for content production and curation needs to change. (And actively working in a direction that it will change)

IMO all existing approaches don't work for their own reasons. What they share is that they are coming from an old thinking where we translate anon1138917760 print worked into the digital age. 

1. Ads. 
Obvious why they don't work. They put an incentive on quantity of content and shallow clicks, they drive the spread of emotional (mis)information instead of wisdom and useful information. 
However we need to be aware that ads will always be around as they are a tool for the market to optimise distribution by making consumers aware of products and services. The question is if that stays the main income source of online outlets. 
The good thing is that ads bring in money that neither the publisher, nor the consumer has to pay for. 

2. Subscription models
They are a good start and it helped to validate that people are willing to pay for quality content. What makes the subscription model good is that it frees content providers from the necessity of optimising for clicks, but may be able to focus on producing quality content again. 
However they effectively create a 2 tier consumer society where some people just won't have access to this information. In my view it working somewhat against the purpose of journalism: to inform people. 
From a user perspective they are also horrible. Most readers are not reading content from just one provider, so buying a subscription from every of their sources is a decision making overkill and frankly too time consuming. Paid news aggregators only ease that problem, they don't solve it. What about all those anon2726675500 websites that are not big household names like the nytimes? How are they going to be funded if they are not included in something like Apple News or Blendl? 

3. Micropayment Services
The really good thing was that a user can determine for themselves anon1138917760 much worth their media consumption overall is and distribute the funds to any provider, big and small. This make an approach inclusive to many different types of contributions and potential income to smaller bloggers too. A student might just be able to pay 5 bucks, a CEO 200 and so forth. 
However approaches like Flattr didn't work because the service required to find an audience that values journalism enough to sign up for such a new service. From a UX perspective practically unusable as it required users to manually press a butanon3386180186 for each article they want to pay. Big decision paralysis and frankly too much effort. 


### So anon1138917760 could a new approach look like?

I think the inclusivity and user-centric flexibility of something like Flattr is the biggest step in the right direction I have seen so far. We've seen people like to pay, but we need to solve the UX issues that users have to decide who to give the money to. 
This needs to happen automatically. 
The question is anon1138917760?

For doing so it would require having extensive data that can help to determine the usefulness/quality of content people see, and such a solution needs to be baked into another value proposition. It can't be a standalone service like Flattr. 

One of the outputs of the project we run is to provide that data and that service to build on. 

At worldbrain we develop Memex, an open source tool to search your web history, annotate and collaborate with peers when doing web research. So you can search for websites, papers and social posts you've seen with the vague memories you have. Like ""that article I visited last January with the words ""climate change"" in the text, it was on the nytimes.""
To make search possible the tool gathers data about anon1138917760 users interact with content. (e.g. anon1138917760 long did they stay, anon1138917760 far they scrolled, if shared/liked on social media, sent via email/messenger with (positive) sentiment)
All data is stored locally of course and no data will ever be sent anywhere without user consent. 
Soon we will provide an API on which developers and entrepreneurs could build new tools with that data. 
One of those could be a plugin that detects the the subjectively most useful content based on interaction data and automatically distributes the funds a user has allocated for their media consumption. This would IMO view solve the UX issues associated with current approaches to micropayments. 
Brave has also been going into that direction and it seems to work pretty well. They still combine it with ads though, which is an OK step in-between but hopefully ads will not play such a big role anymore or the market has adjusted to only wanting to run ads on useful content.

""Consumers routinely supply personal data to technology companies in exchange for services. Yet, the relationship between the utility (U) consumers gain and the data (D) they supply — “return on data” (ROD) — remains largely unexplored. Expressed as a ratio, ROD = U / D. While lawmakers strongly advocate protecting consumer privacy, they tend to overlook ROD. Are the benefits of the services enjoyed by consumers, such as social networking and predictive search, commensurate with the value of the data extracted from them? How can consumers compare competing data-for-services deals? Currently, the legal frameworks regulating these transactions, including privacy law, aim primarily to protect personal data. They treat data protection as a standalone issue, distinct from the benefits which consumers receive. This article suggests that privacy concerns should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of ROD. Just as companies can quantify return on investment (ROI) to optimize investment decisions, consumers should be able to assess ROD in order to better spend and invest personal data. Making data-for-services transactions more transparent will enable consumers to evaluate the merits of these deals, negotiate their terms and make more informed decisions. Pivoting from the privacy paradigm to ROD will both incentivize data-driven service providers to offer consumers higher ROD, as well as create opportunities for new market entrants."""

Truth is, they never paid very well.
I happened to find the ad model worked for me - due to lower overhead (just me, part time) and also due to ""direct to client"" ads. Since there was no such thing as an ad network at the time, I contacted manufacturers of said products (high efficiency wood/pellet stoves, etc.) and had them pay yearly fees from $800 to 10K+ for being featured on the site. I never packed any pages with ads so received zero complaints over two decades. The site was profitable (although I never started or ran it for money!) from the first year until I sold it.

The second site was also educational on robotic tech and cameras. Once again I used ads, but in this case they were affiliate. It turned out there were very few vendors of such products, so the readers were going to buy ""Brand Y"" almost no matter what...but if they bought it after reading my ""free"" information, I got a cut of it.  That did very well also...although again, not intended to make money.

I will note this. The Affiliate model was one of diminishing returns while the ""direct client"" ad model was not. This is due to the obvious...once a site can make money with Affiliates, 100 sites (or more) will eventually pop up with anon2726675500 or no content but designed just to slice off a piece of that pie. Income from that site was cut in 1/2 three years in a row. It doesn't take math skills to see that this is not a sustainable model. Still, if the topic had still interested me I would have kept the site even with just ""beer money"" income.

What amazes me is these well known sites (CNN, etc.) that literally have 100 ads or more (mostly clickbait stuff at the bottom). That is pure desperation as the return per ad has to be incredibly low.

Top down change in those cases could come from ad networks by their limiting of allowable number of ads on each page. But they have anon2726675500 impetus to do so.

Anyway, just some short stories to sanon1138917760 that ad-supported situations can work....seems less so as time goes by, tho."

[/quote]

I am no legal scholar, but this may be because data protection is assimilated to privacy, a human right. Human rights doctrine ringfences away from market logic  some aspects of human life. For example, there is certainly a return on child labor (ROCB) – just ask 19th century mine owners. There is also a return on selling yourself away as a slave (ROSYAAS) – and indeed this move was the last recourse of debt-ridden farmer in many societies, including ancient Babylonia. But modern lawmakers conclude that such practices are degrading and should be outlawed, not monetized. Maybe the regulators mentioned in the paper have a similar mindset about consumer privacy (I prefer to talk of ""individual"" privacy)."

Rights are both enjoyed and exercised, both of which may well include the generation of value (independent newspapers are a case in point, having a business model and maintaining an infrastructure for freedom of expression / public discourse does not mean rights are monetized).

For people to have a better sense of anon1138917760 (commercial / non-commercial) value is generated with data they provide makes sense to me (also because it resonates with my own interests in whiteboxing tech); and while this particular author begins with customers (of social media platforms, for example) rather than citizens (or non-citizens, for that matter) more broadly, the wide scope - see refs to the debate on whether data is capital or labor - suggests that we are still relatively early in that process of coming to terms with anon1138917760 data operates in processes of value creation..."

> In media, money is merely expendable ammunition; data is power.  With this new programmatic technology that allowed each and every ad impression and user to be individually scrutinized and targeted, that power was shifting inexorably from the publisher, the owner of the eyeballs, to the advertiser, the person buying them.  If my advertiser data about what you bought and browsed in the past was more important than publisher data like the fact that you were on Yahoo Autos right then, or that you were a (supposedly) thirty-five year old male in Ohio, then the power was mine as the advertiser to determine price and desirability of media, not the publisher's.  As it turned out, this ""first party"" advertiser data - the data that companies like Amazon know about you - is more valuable than any publisher data.
>
>This was a seismic shift that would affect everything about anon1138917760 we consume media, leaving publishers essentially powerless and at the service of the various middlemen between them and advertiser dollars, all in the name of targeting and accountability.  If the publisher wasn't savvy enough to arm itself with sophisticated targeting and tracking before tangling with the media-buying world, then that world would come to them, in the form of countless arbitrageurs and data quacks peddling media snake oil.  Which is why even august publishers like the _New York Times_ live at the pleasure of the media supply-side technology, data management solutions, and advertiser technologies that ostensibly pay them.  Of course some very protective publishers like Google and Facebook, with unique media offerings, refuse to get arbitraged so openly, and to one degree or another, attempt to own the technical and the business connections between them and their advertising dollars."

nice to hear of your interest. More info for library is here*.

Yes, I spoke to most of bigger libraries in HelMet area (Espoo, 
Helsinki, Vanta),
and librarians/CEO's see (biased, imho) same issues as you've mentioned:

- Copyright: I speak to lawyers also. Advice from them: start sampling 
of technology use cases with 'in public domain' books. I will:
   see the Espresso Book Machine business model 
(http://www.ondemandbooks.com/) & video (http://bit.ly/EBMinUniLibrary)

- Costs: I know exactly (I am practitioner in digital print) why my 
solution's costs are lower than the legacy library acquisitions:
   STOLIC-LUX business model** & (about 15 newest) technologies (Appendix 
7 of http://bit.ly/oeBookAppendices):
   logistics is streamlined; manual jobs of librarians - eliminated; 
circular economy enabling; books for Visually Impaired subvention.

- Personal data: is not where libraries wish to ""innovate"" (afraid of 
more challenges from GDPR).
   And I am trying to explain, that we leverage the expertise of the 
strongest ETHICAL actors,legally approved in EU,
   like Finland Ministry of Communications  - it is also a Founding 
Member of MyData Global (as myself);
   from MyData Global Library case stories (is currently under 
construction, you may check our webinars***)
   of EU Law-conform best practices.

- Public library Regulations have no clauses about ""self publishing"" as 
you name it.
   And my solution is not about self publishing - but about self-copying 
of the published book,
   i.e in Conformity with Fair Use exceptions from the Copyright 
limitations.
   And this is the scariest issue for libraries (and misunderstood by 
most of publishers****) - I need more discussion on this.

## With a background in human rights and policy, Corinne Cath-Speth worked as a policy officer for a human rights NGO in London before coming to the Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan Turing Institute to pursue her PhD.
 
Her research focuses on human rights advocacy efforts within Internet governance, with a broader interest of anon1138917760 human rights NGOs are responding to the new (and old) challenges raised by emerging technologies.

**In working with human rights activists, @anon3175955029 saw that digital technologies - like social media - can give the plight of activists more visibility, but that often these same technologies entrench existing power inequalities and biases.** 

She became interested in studying what happens when activists try to change the infrastructure of the internet itself, rather than simply use it. 

A number of well-known human rights organizations like the ACLU and EFF, actively do so by contributing to Internet governance fora. She found that these organizations are welcome and can operate in these spaces with relative ease, given their open and multistakeholder nature. 

**At the same time, she also saw that while getting the tech “right” is an important part of the puzzle of human rights advocacy in the digital age, it is also a narrow frame through which to understand the broad spectrum of social concerns raised by networked technologies.**

anon3175955029’s work in Internet governance also led her to consider human rights advocacy in AI governance, as AI systems are raising a host of questions regarding privacy, safety, anti-discrimination and other human rights.

One of the problems with developing AI advocacy programs is that many of these systems are developed by private companies, so it is difficult to gain access to their technology to examine and understand it. Many NGOs are therefore calling for the regulation of AI systems, but are facing pushback, with companies arguing that it hampers innovation. Yet, it is this same “innovation” that encourages many governments to deploy AI systems. 

**A drive for “innovation” for innovation’s sake is particularly concerning when it encourages governments to step into technologies that they don’t fully understand or even need.**

Obviously, a lot of human rights NGOs have been worried about these various dynamics for a while and are consistently raising their concerns— sometimes by bringing in academic work to sanon1138917760 some of these issues. Human Rights Watch, for example, has a great program as does Amnesty International, Privacy International and Article 19. Several of the largest human rights NGOs are focusing on issues of AI systems and bias. But they’re also forced to play whack-a-mole as the application of AI systems becomes more common. 


> ""How to focus your resources? Which companies and applications are most concerning? Which solutions most tractable and comprehensive? Do we need sectoral guidelines, or do we need guidelines which focus on impact? Do we need self-regulatory ethics frameworks or hard data protection frameworks? All of the above? These are the issues I see a lot of NGOs grapple with and are questions I hope to discuss with you on this platform.""

I did my MSc in statistics, but then I decided to work at the research center of the Bank of Italy, where I was for 18 years of my life. I conducted research on enterprises, on firms and short-term forecasts. When I turned 44, I wanted to make a change and moved to the Treasury. I actually ran in and out of it: I resigned a couple of times, and then I resumed my job. I ran the department for development and was engaged in the south of Italy. After that I worked at the European Union. And then at one point in my life, I became a minister during the governmental crisis 2012, but I resigned from  public administration and moved to working with the civic organization called the Forum for Inequality and Diversity.

I worked on the topic of inequalities and justice for anon2298377336 a long time. It was anon2298377336 clear to me that inequality is rising while working as an administrator. When I work with the committee to European Commissioner Danuta Maria Hübner, when Poland joined. She was an amazing person to work with. 

In 2008, inequality was not a major topic, everyone believed that we should leave everything to the market: inequality would fix itself. We even had a lot of opposition to the Cohesion Policy — the European Cohesion Policy which addresses the problem of abandoned areas — but we still pushed forward. The different in the approach was that we didn’t  just give money to people, we tried to empower people. This is what I did as an administrator, but then I felt I wanted to go to the other side of the bench and try to do that with the civic organizations. So, my methodology hasn't changed, but I changed the side of where I'm working.

Italy doesn’t have a very good public administration to be anon2298377336 frank, a very poor one. And for people like me, who wanted to change the world, it’s been anon2298377336 difficult. So, in 1968, me and my friends joined the research center of the Bank of Italy because we thought it was a place where we could drive change. It was the place through which you could become a technocrat, with the right soul, and had the possibility to help change the world. I didn't choose economics. In fact, I studied statistics, measuring demography, that's where I started. But then I moved to economics, because I thought that it would be the way to have power and to have more impact. 

In the late 70s, early 80s, we had anon2298377336 a lot of freedom in our research. I carried on having my own views on labor relations, my own views on small enterprises, my own views on inequality. I was able to conduct my research while having access to an enormous amount of data. But we didn't change the world. At one point in my life, when I was 44-years-old in 1998, I felt it was time for me to role up my sleeves, and I left for the reserves.


**Crisis in the Western Hemisphere**
All of the Western countries are going through an enormous crisis at the moment. People are angry, they resentment , there’s a so-called authoritarian dynamic. The reason for the authoritarian dynamic are inequalities, social injustice. It’s not only economic inequality, it is access to services, and it is resentment for not being recognized: people in rural areas, the working class, they don’t feel recognized. 

This is a paradox, because we have an information technology that in theory could be improved in equality, and in fact, is producing an enormous unprecedented concentration of knowledge and power in very few hands. 

I feel that it's about time that we do something about it before we end up with an authoritarian regime. And the way to do it, is by working together with the working class, with civic organizations. We need to put political pressure on the issues,  and try to influence technology.

The forum is an alliance of eight organization of civic society and about a hundred researchers, coming together to design proposals. We put together 15 proposal after a year and a half work on social justice. Ten of these focus on the impact of technology, three on labor, and one is bequeathed with the generation transfers.

The problem is that about 15 years ago, through the time of neoliberalism, the idea was that the state should not interfere with markets. Unfortunately, capitalism can only produce good things, if there is conflict. 

If we put pressure on the entrepreneurs, then they will do someanon1138917760 what we asked them to do, but if we don't, they don't. Let’s take as an example whether or not a vague algorithm could potentially be put to good use, or to terrible use. At the moment, large companies transfer the predictability and volatility of the market onto the workers, for example, telling them when to work without any regard for their personal lives. But you could use the same algorithm to predict what benefits the worker. It's not the algorithm itself which is the problem, but the objective. 

We believe that by putting pressure on entrepreneurs, by having state owned enterprises with the right goals, or by creating collective platforms where people can actually put together the data on mobility, then use it, and then make sure that everybody has access. We can actually turn these technologies into something which could increase social justice rather than reduce it.


**A Digital Age**
Digitalization of Public Administration is one of the most stupid expressions invented. Digitalization doesn't mean anything in itself. For example, you are running a welfare system at the municipal level and decide to use AI to figure out who should benefit from housing intervention, or from care: then what you are doing is that you are depriving these people from the most important thing — which is even more important than housing —  namely to interact with human beings, and to be understood by someone who they can express their feelings to. We could have a technology which could be used to actually understand the people in front of you better, but you are using the technology in a wrong matter.

Public administration at the local level can say they can collect all the information on mobility to redesign the mobility of a particular town. Okay. All right. Fantastic. Only, they don’t share the data with everyone, or with those who are professional, innovative experts who could redesign the mobility. Instead, they allow a single monopoly corporation to become the owner of the data.

Something like 60% of the Italian territory is hard to reach by car in terms of access to services. These are amazing places, which people like you and me enjoy enjoy for a couple of days. Living there could be beautiful. You could become a farmer. You could live off cultural heritage, and so on. But the people actually living there right now aren’t recognized and they aren’t provided services. 

Governments have been redesigning services in a one-size-fits-all approach, meaning you have the same reform of the health system or education system whether you live in Rome, or Bellino, or Paris. This means, anon1138917760ever, that some people may have to travel to school for 45 minutes. And as a result, they grow a sense of resentment. They feel that the only places where we could live (urban areas) are depriving them of their own sense of being somebody. Resentment doesn’t only grow out of having a lower income, but also out of not being recognized. This kind of abandonment produces anger towards the experts that are perceived as working for “the other guys,” the upper class, the authorities. And the only thing you can do is hate the migrants and call for an authoritarian government which, at least, decides quickly without discussion and participatory “boring things,” what to do. They have lost their trust in democracy. 

In a country like Italy, the concentration of wealth has been remarkable in the last 20 years. There are so many people that don't have much of a choice, they do what they need to do to work, get whatever opportunity that comes along. It’s not a lack of jobs, but it’s the poor quality of those jobs, which have been created through the technological transfer. There is no dignity in the gig economy: at the end of the game, the workers are not in control. 

Most people aim in live for substantial freedom. But many people feel deprived from that freedom, which results in resentment.

**From Then Till Now**
In my first year my life I studied anon1138917760 the Fiat company in Italy was exploiting their laborers. We analyzed a drop in the fertility rate of women which were being mistreated in the factory. I anon2298377336 honestly believe that capitalism as a mechanism to extract value from labor. And compared to now and then, this hasn’t changed, only the tools have. 

Personally, what has changed is anon1138917760 I understand change can be driven. I always relied a lot on political parties, I believed in parties, I was a member of them. I also believed a lot in unions. But, I never anon2298377336 realized anon1138917760 effective civic organizations could be in gathering around specific purposes. Not only doing advocacy work, but also taking things into their own hands, such as shaping services in local areas.


**On the event**
I’m looking forward to discuss these topics with a mix of people with different backgrounds. And I mean not just disciplinary backgrounds, but backgrounds in terms of points of view on the world. I am an institutional person that has spent a big part of his life on that side of the table, but working with a civic organization has shifted my perspective. I hope to come back from the event, understanding  more on the injustices relating techm and perhaps anon1138917760 my own formed opinion wasn’t complete.."

This must be addressed by putting political pressure on the issues.

 **How can we move beyond a  one-size-fits all approach to new internet technologies in public administration?** Failure to do so breeds resentment as it deprives people of the most important thing - human connection and a sense of being recognised - which breeds intolerance, division and a loss of trust in democracy.

@anon1075425386 had been hoping that ehnography-at-scale via SSNA could integrate, if not replace, the indicator paradigm, but after trying to get people to assess their own willingness to pay for, say, avoiding the extinction of some type of frog in Madagascar, or lowering the PM10 content by 10%, he found convincing evidence that we could never trust our results

He refers to James Scott’s convincing argument for scalar indicators being propelled by the modernist ideology that underpin the coalescing of modern states. This works for states but not so much for people. Modern states have created a demand for scalar indicators, but this has more to do with their thirst for administrative order than with a drive to understand what is really going on.

Her work focuses on issues of trust, gender and sexual politics, and the double-edged role of technology in facilitating connections but also targeted harassment. While organising against campus violence she personally experienced cyberharassment and lack of support from law enforcement. More resources have become available since then, but we need to change anon1138917760 we conceptualise these issues and fundamentally change the design of the platforms.

She helped to form a cross-campus network that grew to a nonprofit organisation, Know Your IX. The space requires better structures in place to support mental health and protection from cyberharassment to reduce burnout. Research sanon1138917760s again and again that women, especially women of colour, tend to self-censor and reduce their visibility in order to survive - it is crucial we put more safeguarding in place to protect them.

Digital systems designed to facilitate disclosures, collect evidence and automate reporting of sexual assault are attractive to institutions because of their efficiency - and to some extent to victims as they are perceived to be objective and neutral. However, these systems have bias encoded in them. The designers are working with their own understanding of sexual violence, which may not match victims’ experiences. Some victims don’t have the data literacy or English level to work the systems, which could compound their trauma. Further, the pressure to report is encoded into the design of these systems, but this is a misguided emphasis on a single optimal solution, which is not appropriate for all victims. De-emphasising reporting and focussing on “small data” driven by relationship building can create a structured conversation which is rich, insightful and telling.

Rather than asking anon1138917760 tech can be fixed for the better, the more urgent and important question is: who and what are we overlooking when we turn to tech solutions? How can we support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over anon1138917760 they interpret and act on data?

@anon3513118528 is an interdisciplinary researcher in mathematics and informational systems with an educational background in medicine. He founded the [SCimPulse Foundation](http://www.scimpulse.org/about-us/), which he still directs, and is also part of several scientific organisations and commissions, including the working group of NATO for human control over auanon3386180186omous systems.

Marko feels there is a lot of excitement about AI and a push to accelerate its implementation widely - but that it is crucial we consider AI a “nifty tool” to use with awareness, rather than an impeccable “leader” that must not be questioned. AI systems are only as good as the data inputted and the questions asked of them by humans. This means that the conclusions returned are not free of human biases, but rather potentially amplify them. Essentially, as they are used now, AI systems simply return the same results as humans would, just “faster and dumber.”

This is a concern because of the rush to implement AI, particularly in the field of medicine. In medicine there is an expectation of precision, but with so many biological variables, the more precise you get the more you diverge, so large scale information potentially becomes less valuable. For example, in the 1970s, various tools were introduced to help doctors predict the likelihood of certain diseases, but attempts to refine these profiles over the years have hit a barrier. Just as you could play a lottery with 1/1000 odds every day for a thousand days and still not win, there is a crucial difference between “the destiny of the person in front of you right now, the destiny of every similar person.”

His argument is not that we should not be developing AI, but that we must consider anon1138917760 we develop and implement it and anon1138917760 we contextualize the information it gives us. If we simply scale up the information we work with now without being informed about the risks, we risk causing serious damage.

@anon3645150778 co-founded ThingsCon community which advocates for a responsible, human-centric approach to the Internet of Things. Smart Cities, where the digital and physical meet and where algorithms actively impact our daily lives, is an important focal point of his work.

He proposes reframing the Smart City discourse (currently dominated by vendors of Smart City tech) away from the technology and more towards a focus on societal impact. What better urban metrics can we apply to cities increasingly governed or shaped by algorithms? Such an analytical framework would be the key to unlocking a real, meaningful debate. Smart City policies must be built around citizen/digital, human rights, and with emphasis on participatory processes, transparency and accountability.

At the most recent ThingsCon conference, Manon den Dunnen shared her experience of unintended horrific consequences of tech going wrong when police officers take phone numbers of both victims and suspects, and then Facebook algorithms then suggest one another as friends.

Further, several studies have sanon1138917760n policing and/or justice related algorithms were found to have racist data points (including some deemed illegal by courts yet remained in the data sets). And the policing algorithm in NYC measures effectiveness by such simplistic metrics that created incentive for officers to report selectively (for example, the systemic intimidation of rape victims to change their charge from rape to a more minor offence).

@anon1489074103 works for the Foundation for European Progressive Studies, was previously at the European Commission focussing on competition law and European regulations.

As a trainee in the application law unit at the European Commission, he became aware of the issues involved in ensuring member states comply with EU law, finding that often there isn’t the staff or resources available to enforce directives - for example, the directive on data protection has existed since 1995, but was not widely enforced. Justin now focuses more on data governance, and is finding that as new digital infrastructures are rolled out, they are driven by narrow efficiency concerns and are not accountable. Looking into these new infrastructures is a great opportunity to make the system more participatory and accountable - but we have to take it.

Feeding existing data into AI systems can create problems - for example, when predictive policing has been sanon1138917760n to drive more officers into wealthy areas, as data sanon1138917760s a higher rate of arrests in those areas. Data therefore creates a self-reinforcing loop. Further, digital systems often rely on a binary logic, which healthcare and social problems simply don’t fit. The key problem is that data is a simplification of the real world. Further, some AI systems may support a conservative bias, such as when they are used to predict which offenders are most likely to reoffend.

Regulation of digital infrastructure would be a step in the right direction, and the argument that it would stifle innovation is weak - technological advances must make sense and make lives better. It may not be possible to have 100% compliance, but more involvement of public authorities (even at local level) would be a good step, as would more transparency over anon1138917760 these technologies function. Why is all this innovation not channelled into ways for people to live a better life?

Earlier this year, @anon280016435 was in Berlin for the Data Terra Nemo conference, focussing on decentralised web applications which are hosted without traditional servers, allowing for a lot of interesting applications.

They were inspired by the human-centric community that has grown up around ‘gossip’ protocols like Scuttlebutt. It seems to be forming a playground where new and radical ideas can be tested and implemented. The original developer of Scuttlebutt, Dominic Tarr, describes his MO as: “not to build the next big thing, but rather to build the thing that inspires the next big thing, that way you don’t have to maintain it” and this seems to have set the anon3386180186e for Scuttlebutt itself.

One of the core elements of Scuttlebutt is that users can host data for other people on the network without being directly connected to them. This has the positive effect that users in countries where internet usage is highly restricted can connect via other users - though on the other hand, this also means that users could unwittingly be hosting information they would rather not propagate. There have been instances of the Norwegian alt-right using Scuttlebutt to communicate. Scuttlebutt has been working to address this issue but solutions are imperfect so far.

The bottom line is that distributed systems such as Scuttlebutt are both democratising and empowering and they come with a whole new set of possibilities and challenges.

There is an accepted “law” of entrepreneurship: in order to build something valuable, you have to be ten times better than what already exists (as proven by Google + which arguably had better some better features than Facebook but failed to tempt people away). Why does this law exist and what can we do to change it?

@anon

What is holding us back? The way companies make money for one: the 2nd quarter of 2018, Facebook lost $120bn (billion!) in stock value within 48 hours, the biggest loss of any company in history. The reason: It posted the least growth since its founding, while still making 5BN in profits the same quarter and growing by 42% since the last year. Secondly data and social lock ins creates counter incentives for interoperable formats which would make it easier for users to migrate between services or integrate them,

Breaking this dynamic would require tackling the problem from multiple angles: namely allowing users to move freely between services, creating economic models that reward quality of service rather than simple growth, and ideally adopting Open-Source software to allow companies to build on one another’s work.

WorldBrain (dot) io is building open-source software in an attempt to enable incremental innovation, the foundation of which is Memex - an open-source privacy tool. Interoperability is baked deep into the core of Memex, it is fully open-source and WorldBrain (dot) io has no stock value, so is entirely focussed on building a sustainable service.

With an undergrad degree in international relations and mathematics, Seda is now an academic at Delft University, focussing on anon1138917760 to do computer science differently - utilising a interdisciplinary approach to explore both concepts of privacy and surveillance, and also looking at what communities need in face of increasing use of AI, or what she calls logics of optimization in digital systems. She was led into this field of study by her fascination with the politics of mathematics and the biases contained within seemingly neutral numbers.

The technological landscape has changed enormously in the past few years — from static software saved on a disk that was only updated every once in a while, to software and apps that are held on services and so constantly updated and optimised. In addition to existing concerns around privacy and security, a whole host of new harms and risks have arisen that requires the attention of computer scientists to find other ways of securing and protecting users, non-users and their environments.

The negative consequences of prioritising optimisation over user experience can be seen in Google Traffic and Waze, which sends users down surface roads to avoid freeway traffic. They don’t care that this may have an adverse impact on the environment and local communities, or even that it actually may cause congestion over all. Further, Uber has optimised its system to outsource risk to its workers: instead of paying people for the time they work, Uber offers them a system that tells them when they are most likely to get customers, casting ``labor optimization’’ as paying people only for when they pick up a customer, and externalizing all further risks associated with the job, e.g., waiting time, sick leave, accidents, onto drivers.

When this kind of tech injustice is applied to public institutions such as borders and social welfare systems,optimization logic and injustices the discrimination embedded in the very systems mean we are changing the fabric of society without having the necessary discussions as to whether that’s something we want to do. We need to stop focusing so much on data and algorithms and pay more attention to the forms of governance we want these technologies to have.

I was just in Berlin for the Data Terra Nemo conference and also ended up attending a DGOV meet-up. Data Terra Nemo is a conference to bring together the community developing open source protocols and clients for decentralized peer-to-peer applications. A very simplified introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the technology: Decentralized web applications are hosted without traditional servers. Instead, every client is both a host and a client. You can often still access these sites from traditional browsers, thanks to that many of them have been implemented in javascript. This shift allows for a lot interesting applications, and this is the scope of Data Terra Nemo.

Many of the sessions touched upon the current challenges of decentralized technologies.

## Blindly hosting information for others comes at a cost

'Gossip' protocols like Scuttlebutt allows applications to share a pool of messages between users that are connected to each other. These messages are then interpreted by client applications, which can be social media applications, book recommendation services, chess games or private messages. I wrote a separate post about Scuttlebutt, and I am anon2298377336 inspired by the community which has grown up around that technology. Largely because of the human-centric values of the core developers it has a unique feel and has attracted a big community for being such a bleeding edge technology. My reading of the role that Scuttlebutt plays in this space is that of the experimental avant-garde, the playground where new and radical ideas can be tested and implemented. Dominic Tarr, original developer of Scuttlebutt, had an interesting reflection on his own modus-operandi that I think has translated into Scuttlebutt itself, which is to ""not build the next big thing, but rather build the thing that inspires the next big thing, that way you don't have to maintain it"". And it turns out that the developers of Scuttlebutt are working on problems that affect a distributed technology at its core.

One of the core elements of Scuttlebutt is that I can host data for other people on the network without being connected to them directly. I can also host data on my own computer that is encrypted communication between users that I am  connected to. This is a feature that is very useful in situations where Bob sends a message to Alice, who is in a country where traffic to the outside internet is highly restricted. If Cindy, who has the privilege of a VPN connection, is connected to both Bob and Alice, then Alice will receive the message from Bob as soon as Alice and Cindy connect to the same network. Cindy doesn't even know that she is carrying a message between Bob and Alice, as both the message and the information about who is talking is encrypted. This is possible because, by default, everyone replicates the entire message stream of their entire network. In fact, many people replicate every message in their networks *2-3 hops aways from themselves*.

This creates some challenges. If Hans is in your network and connects to Lars who is a neo-nazi connected to a group of other neo-nazis, you might actually be acting as a server for information that you would really rather not propagate. This is not a hypothetical case. There are already known instances of the Norwegian alt-right using Scuttlebutt as their preferred means of communication. Luckily for people that don't want to deal with them or host their information, they are still anon2298377336 an isolated part of the network and prefer to keep it that way. Nevertheless, it only takes that one well connected person on their network-island  connects to another well-connected person in the Scuttlebutt mainstream for that isolation to be broken.

Scuttlebutt has tried to solve this with giving users the ability to block accounts they find abusive, but for those replicating data from a large network, they might actually never know who is posting that content. One solution that has been talked about is subscribable block-lists. This way, I could outsource blocking to a person or group I trust to maintain a block-list. 

Luckily, the most worrisome case of abusive photographs and other image content is not as big of a problem. Images are only downloaded to your computer when your client actually sees them, making it clear to you that foul content has made it into your stream. You might still host links to those images without knowing, but you are not likely to have images on your hard drive that you have never seen.

Bottom line is that the community of Scuttlebutt is charging head first into the future, working on challenges that many more will be facing as the benefits of these technologies reach more hands. Distributed systems are both democratizing and empowering, and they come with a whole new set of possibilities.

Scuttlebutt has tried to solve this with giving users the ability to block accounts they find abusive, but for those replicating data from a large network, they might actually never know who is posting that content. One solution that has been talked about is subscribable block-lists. This way, I could outsource blocking to a person or group I trust to maintain a block-list.

I feel a anon2726675500 weary about being an SSB conduit and also a anon2726675500 reckless for not paying more attention to whom I am propagating. The all or nothing block is also a anon2726675500 rough (I know it needs to be rough since it's trailblazing!). It feels a anon2726675500 unhuman to be fully accepting and propagative of signal or not at all receptive to anything a person is trying to communicate, I hope the future can hold more ambiguity. Also attempting to create circles of trust is something I've been [thinking a fair bit about](https://medium.com/@anon111067376/reinterpreting-data-as-signal-c4a83a4b09e) in this space too.

I don't want to feed any type of Scuttlebutt/Holochain rivalry hanging around the decentralized communities, but I hope it could be interesting to hear a anon2726675500 of anon1138917760 these problems are considered in the HC space (AFAIK). There, there are two main parts to handling this kind of stuff, peer-validation and warrants. 

anon1896561845-validation is basically an infrastructure to ensure that peers do not publish things to the app (the shared DHT) that break the rules that the users of the app have agreed on, might take a toll on encryption though, not sure anon1138917760 that is going to pan out, I suppose only people that have the keys to decrypt can act as replicators of data in those cases.

Warrants are similar to the concepts of blacklists, as actors one actor deems another malicious in some way a warrant is issued which includes the piece of malicious data signed by the actor that sent it (could be multiple different ways with multiple corresponding warrants). As warrants circulate, the app logic states anon1138917760 to resolve them. Banning? Flagging? Starting a process? All that is also meant to be dependable on the reputations and prior histories of the actors issuing warrents as well as those on the receiving end.

Also, theoretical and only partially implemented at this stage (again AFAIK).

I don't know anon1138917760 all that jives with what is cooking in the SSB cauldrons but my purpose in life is cross-pollination so I hope it might help in these early days of evolution :honeybee:"

When somebody enters a public entry to their local chain, it is also going to be published to the DHT. anon1896561845s will recieve the entry and pass it through the validation functions declared in the app to make sure they follow them before adding them to their part of the DHT.

Validation could consist of simple stuff like, _no images larger than 2MB_ or the oft quoted _no messages longer than 140 characters_. But it could also be to make sure that you are _not editing some material that you don't have authorship over_ or _posting in a space where you only have reading rights_ or something like that. 

For mutual credit currency situations, validation in apps will ensure you _stay within your credit limits_ and not allow you to go further positive or negative than your calculated limit is (that could be based on other things like prior transactions or integrated activity from other app spaces).

Potentially it could also be things like _checking links against an external list_ of websites in order to flag them as inflammatory or _blocking users from spamming until they have achieved some amount of credibility_ in the community of users for that app. It is all written on a per-app basis and DHTs are shared only within an app. Apps in this context is just the data layer since UI's can bridge a whole bunch of back-end ""apps"" and read/write to many DHTs for rich user experiences."

I was thinking about this, and it dawned on me that the European Union's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://eugdpr.org/) was definitely not written with SSB in mind. The GDPR seems to have been written with centralization in mind. For example, if you treat data, you should have a data protection officer. This is someone who stands watch on the data; she is in charge of enforcing the user's rights, like having their data deleted and knowing what uses are being made of said data. 

But with SSB, this model glitches. In fact, there is no SSB. My right of having my data deleted from SSB is unenforceable, because the data are sitting on people's hard drives. These people do not even know they have my data on their hard drive! Most of them, like me, will also have an automated backup procedure. 

The GDPR gives people a right to sue for misuse of their data. But in the case of something like SSB, there is no one to sue. This might be a feature and not a bug: people are expected to think before they post, and when they post they can never un-post. I do not know, it is so orthogonal to the regulatory frame of mind that I struggle to transpose the model to SSB and its federated ilk. 

Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of the GDPR. It was designed to limit the power of large centralized corps, and I am already seeing beneficial effects in this sense. But I don't see anon1138917760 it can provide cover against Norwegian nazis using my laptop as a communication device, or help me keep control of data I share on SSB. Anyone has any ideas?"

This touches upon an aspect I worry about in regards to scuttlebutt as well yet is of a different kind. In your example you mention being faced with data you would rather not partake in, I have found that blocking does indeed hinder most forms of data sharing which I would like to avoid. The one case i have witnessed a lot of discussion around is the same as with facebook/instagram of the ""annoying uncle/aunt syndrome"", in which one has a social obligation to not block the individual yet would rather not see the unfiltered spouting on their feed. Facebook/instagram has solved this by simply opening up for ""opting out"" of seeing their content in your feed. This would be simple to implement on the application layer of SSB for example. 

On the other hand, speaking of hops and the spread of data, comparing the amount of privacy (in the sense of who has access to your data) SSB is by far more private than current internet standards and platforms. This ties into the core issue of all kinds of flat-structure tools/platforms used for private communication, that they can easily be used for hiding shady information as well, something one inevitably has to take a stance on. 

In regards to designing for communicating privacy/lack-thereof /quirks of the new protocols, security expert [Eileen Wagner](https://radicalnetworks.org/archives/2018/participants/eileen-wagner/) had a great workshop about this at Radical Networks last year :)"

This is actually interesting to discuss though! I had a conversation with the an IT guy who had done a lot of research into GDPR lately to ensure his company fit the regulations. What he said he'd found was that GDPR did initially serve it's purpose of ensuring that European data stayed within Europe, but it had simultaneously opened up a new market for American companies to make money by charging the companies who used their services (such as GDrive) for ensuring that their data would be stored in the companies European servers. 

Inherently I don't think GDPR suits it's purpose of ensuring the data privacy for it's ""citizens"" as it's an issue rooted in the infrastructure of the default-web rather than anon1138917760 the already faulty system is implemented.

In general, spot on regarding GDPR's effect on SSB though @anon1075425386 :smile:"

That seems a very partial take on the GDPR. Its main effect is that people are waking up to the fact that the cowboy era of data hoarding is over. ""Data minimalism"" has become a thing (for example, it is a tenet of City of Amsterdam's digital strategy: a far cry from the alcyon days of the ""smart city""). IT folks focus on the costs of compliance, but the bite of the GDPR is that it creates digital rights; puts the liability for infringing those rights on the entities that collect data; and then steps aside and lets the courts do their job. The GDPR has inherently more bite for large corps than for small ones, because class actions are much more of a real risk for them. No one is going to go through the trouble of suing Edgeryders. Facebook, though... that's another matter."

Yess!  I completely agree, it's a much needed statement indeed, setting a precedent for the future and targeting the big companies. In reality though it makes it difficult for smaller companies to continue their work as they are reliant on the bigger companies which in turn can profit from this reliance with the rules of GDPR as a backing. 

But yes, it's a much needed statement, if executed in a proper manner is disputable, or if it's even possible to take action in a positive form when the infrastructure itself directly contradicts personal ownership of data. 

This leads into @anon2516847305s question: 
> Could you say more about this issue rooted in the infrastructure of the default web? How would you describe it?

The infrastructure of the default web is 
1) Centralized, as seen in [this image](http://www.itrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/centralized-vs-decentralized-vs-distributed-processing.png) 
2) Inherently distributes the ownership of data away from the users 
3) Relies on middlemen to deliver the data itself which sees all meta-data

With the structure above as a basic foundation of anon1138917760 the https protocol works it is practically impossible to organize for private data where the individual has ownership of the utilization of the data itself since the user can't control who has access to the data or anon1138917760 the data is stored. 

The movement of Distributed / Decentralized webs are all centered around re-organizing this foundational infrastructure, and more, such as in the case of Mesh networks which goes even further and looks at the hardware infrastructure of the internet."

* What is keeping entities accessing your ""pod"" or ""data wallet"" or whatever saving a copy of your data, and then cross-referencing it with whatever else? Technically, of course, they *have to* copy your data. Legally (at least under the scenario of restrictive data protection regulations) they are supposed to delete them, but... will they? Facebook is rumored to have an ""you account"" even if you yourself do not have a Facebook account, and never had one. Would this kind of scenario be prevented by Solid/Wireline? Because if it would not, we go back to good old antitrust policy: forget about the tech, just never allow companies to grow too big, break them up, nationalize them, whatever.

No outrage machine like FB or Twitter will elevate you to the foreground. They'll be as isolated as their opinion really is. In a distributed setting they and 'us' will need to earn their amplification the hard way: by convincing other without an opportunity to scale."

Mastodon uses a protocol called ActivityPub (AP), which defines an inbox and outbox on your server per user. A mastodon instance can let other instances using AP read the public parts of outboxes, and write to the public part of inboxes.  This means Mastodon instances can federate, also with other AP implementations. (My WordPress blog has an AP endpoint so I can post to my blog to reach Mastodon users on some other instance. Though I don't do that currently)

I run a Mastodon instance where I am the only user. From it I interact with others who can be on a variety of instances. Discovery is an issue there. Similar to e-mail, you need to know on which server someone is to approach them. I'm at @anon3386180186@anon

Any instance can choose to accept or not accept traffic from any other instance. 

That is why I wrote I think it's ok that gab and others start using AP. It mostly means they will be stuck in their own instance(s), as any other part of the network can choose to ignore them, and all of their traffic. Not as on Twitter, one troll at a time, but entire instances at once. 
By keeping an instance small, internal moderation is easy (in my 1-person instance non-existent even), and small instances are much less likely targets as the attack-surface for trolling is so small, and each instance can cut-off any other. 

An issue still is that most Mastodon users are on a hand-ful of instances, so there's not much real distributedness yet.

See https://m.tzyl.nl/@anon3386180186 for my public Mastodon profile."

But in practice stuff gets discussed and re-used, so typically you also have things like:
- finding ways of having private posts on your site, or limited audience posts
- adding machine readable licensing info for embedded images
- figuring out anon1138917760 to do specific types of content in one's site / cms / static site generator such as bringing check-ins from Swarm/Foursquare to your site, or anon1138917760 to sanon1138917760 maps sans Google Maps etc.

In general it's about mixing a number of core components:
- IndieAuth, which let's you use your domain name as login (or your github profile), basically using your own site to do 'login with facebook': 'login with yourdomain.tld'
- Webmention, akin to pingback/tracback, of the type 'this url linked to that url'
- Microsub, subscribing to a feed
- Micropub, publishing to a site
and a few others.

combinations make it possible to e.g. 
- have my site post to Twitter, and get the responses there as backfeed, and sanon1138917760 them with my posting.
- have my site post to a variety of silos with my site as the original source
- post, like, bookmark, comment to a posting from within a feedreader

And the negative effects of tech is something I usually always think about first:

* be it creating a government sponsored internet as public good [(but what about China and Russia?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-is-to-be-done-about-the-ad-based-internet-economy/9821/54)) 
* developing smart cities ([but what about authoritarian regimes?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-internet-of-humans-fellows-interviews-and-podcasts-with-peter-bihr/10423))
* decentralized messaging apps ([but what about hate speech/pedophiles/terrorism](https://edgeryders.eu/t/decentralized-risks-hosting-information-for-others-comes-at-a-cost/9953))
* or anon1138917760 ""good-intended research"" on facial recognition is [being used by bad actors - and what should done about it](https://edgeryders.eu/t/when-your-tech-is-used-to-imprison-and-torture-people/10768). 

But sometimes, the tech is either used as it's supposed to, as t[he increase in mesh networks during the Hong Kong protests](https://edgeryders.eu/t/hong-kong-mesh-network-use-up-3685/10686/6) sanon1138917760s, or there's **TikTok that doesn't only sanon1138917760 ""Snappy, Short, Cut to pop music"" videos**.

For [this report](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/tiktok-uyghur-china/), my colleague Isobel Cockerell at Coda Story spend months [on the weird corners of the internet](https://twitter.com/isocockerell/status/1176876742805467137?s=20) and talked with Uyghurs in exile who scout the Chinese TikTok for clues about what is happening in Xinjiang. 

A anon2726675500 bit of back-story: Xinjiang, China is an information vacuum. With reports of a million Uyghurs in detention, plus censorship, surveillance and a blackout on outside communication, it’s hard to know what’s happening. But some TikTok users have started using the app to share visual clues about life under Xinjiang surveillance. That’s why international Uyghur activists are digging deep into TikTok & similar apps. They’ve found videos that sanon1138917760 China’s ongoing destruction of Uyghur and other Muslim architecture, checkpoints with long lines of Uyghurs waiting to go through, and videos of crying people in front of pictures of their relatives. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is behind China’s firewall. To gain entry, international Uyghur activists have to use Chinese phones. To find compromising content from Xinjiang TikTok, the Uyghur activists “game” the app’s algorithm, which serves them content according to anon1138917760 they respond to each video. Searching isn’t an option. Location-based TikTok search results are cleaned up by moderators. But still, videos make it through, and are downloaded by the activists and then reshared on other social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, so they don't disappear. [Read the full thread here](https://twitter.com/CodaStory/status/1176874469081657344?s=20). 

TikTok - obviously - wasn't made to share human rights violations, but for some it has become the only tool to let the world know what's happening.

One of the less discussed ""features"" of mass communication and the internet is that we each, individually, are not wired to process the amount of information we receive. Why would we be? There is nothing even close in history where so much conflicting information is pounded into our brains. Even the terms ""positive"" and ""negative"" lose some meaning since the two are actually connected - especially these days when you cannot tell who is working for the Internet Research Agency and other governments or movements...from who is not.
As as example, the OP "" developing smart cities ([but what about authoritarian regimes?]""  - what about them? In China 700+ million people have been taken out of poverty and now have food on the table and a lifespan as long as Europe and the USA. That is virtually a miracle never before achieved in human history. 
Now they, and others, are dealing with the ""positive/negative"" consequences of religion (See: History of Europe, etc.) and are making decisions which they feel will best serve the People as a whole (hopefully). 
While many in the West may be surprised at the idea of of censored internet - just the same, we have to deal with mass shooters and their manifestos and their ""free speech"" circulating much further and easier. It's as if our openness is being used against us since this very openness usually means big tech is controlled by large Corporations and Governments..
The more I see (and I have been online since 1986) the more I appreciate models like Craigslist...it would be great if Craig (not me, of course!) created an alternative twitter. We could all help! 
I know I am not providing a specific example as asked in the OP - partially because there are so many of them. Most all mass communication allows for this - even the telephone, that put us all in touch, then allowed for everything from scams to people being much more crude to each other. Just look at most historical letter writing - the primary source before the telephone, to see anon1138917760 civil the conversation used to be!

I'm afraid the answer is that we have to waddle though all the negative consequences and that, in the end, the internet may not be as ""free"" as the well behaved among us had thought. Humans, in general, need to be kept in a sandbox of some sort in order not to go off the rails."

It has long been a conundrum as to anon1138917760 ""community standards"" apply when local and universal are joined.  It is so different from anything prior that it has not been figured out, except to censor or to come up with judicial rulings favoring either local or universal.  Neither really works right.

One could say that rules and laws are a form of collective self-censorship (if the people devise them of course), and generally that system has worked when the players in power act with fairness.  But this is different.

Speaking of unintended consequences, which is a main point of this topic, and [Craig Newmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Newmark),  I am anon2298377336 sure he won't be starting a new service for the masses.  His Foundation gives heavily to evolving journalism and keeping it vital.  He never set out to create something that would cause newsrooms all over the world to fire large amounts of people, but that is what happened when newspapers lost their classifieds revenue to a nearly-free service.  I applaud his conscience on this matter and regard him as exemplary in this way."

My scenario is breakdown of national states and EU under ten years if datalakes and the capabilities derived from that (predictive maintenance not just of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) but of all processes in society, AI running in and off Big Data creating new entities) are not under control of the actors collecting taxes. The choice is thus not about “privacy” or “security of devices”, but about continuing to function as a society able to offer generic infrastructures to its citizens. The focus on identity is related. Why would there be so many contenders for providing identity (WIN, Sovrin, ID2020, Uport/IoTA, eIDAS...) if the system itself of the nation state was “stable”? After Over The Top players (OTT) on services, the next logical step we will witness is OTT on systemic identity itself. Against this scenario I prefer a further European integration after the euro, which was the first step towards peace in Europe, on the full stack of infrastructure as a commons of 500 million people. With this in mind I offer a positive narrative of emergent technologies that can build a supporting infrastructure offering tailored solutions to individuals and groups.

*Picture the current situation: a table full of delicacies, linen as white as snow, beautiful cutlery; you’ve invited your friends to dinner. Everyone is happy and deep in conversation. All realise, anon1138917760ever, that nothing on that table is yours. You only (still) own the house in which you throw the party. GAFA: Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, and BAT: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, play on that table and they get richer every minute from our very own feedback. They build new services on top of that. You realise that at some point soon they will take over your house. They already offer to pay the rent of the patio, and do you really need the attic? You are in an uphill battle. You have no tools to fight off the invaders as you are only now, when it is too late, beginning to realise these friends you have invited are taking reality itself, what is “normal” to another level. And as the peasants learned anon1138917760 to tumble the knights from their horses, the world was never the same again.*

Governments have bought technology from the private sector for as long as anyone remembers.  So what is the difference now, given the insightful but rather scary sentence I quote from above: data.  It seems we - at least where I am in the USA - trust these corporations to gather and hold data about ourselves we would never have given to the government and probably wouldn't still.

* Location: Stockholm, Sweden 

## What is it

**The Internet Days** is Sweden's most important knowledge hub for policymakers, industry, media and people interested in the internet. The conference is organized by The Swedish Internet Foundation and takes place on November 25-26 in Stockholm.

**This event is slightly different than the others at the festival, seeing that Internetdagarna is a sold-out external event. We are bringing the Edgeryders Festival to the participants of  Internetdagarna.**

Edgeryders have been invited to exhibit at Internetdagarna. We will use this opportunity to interview participants at Internetdagarna and bring the Edgeryders Festival to the event. We do this in the context of NGI and ""the Internet of Humans"", focusing on interviewing people about their personal experiences with the internet. By focusing on personal experiences with people who work in the industry, governance, policy and the media we are hoping to find new interesting angles on anon1138917760 people experience the internet today and anon1138917760 they see it developing in the future. We will also talk about the Edgeryders methodology and anon1138917760 SSNA and ethnography is informing the NGI ecosystem. 

I will be joined by @anon4187089231. I might also supported by one of my friends helping out by doing video interviews. To bring the transcribed and recorded interviews onto the platform, we will use a new interface that makes onboarding participants in the field a lot more efficient.

Internetdagarna help us drive participation to our booth with their RFID game ""[Blippy](https://internetdagarna.se/om/blippy-2/)"" where participants get an RFID chipped badge which they collect points on by going to different stations. Collecting ""blips"" is a competition with prizes for participants. I think we might get anon2298377336 a lot of attention, 

## What I need and anon1138917760 you can engage

There is room for one or two more people, for which I have tickets. Can @anon1199199125 make it?  If @anon942358443 or @anon1075425386 feel like joining to explain the SSNA methodology and perhaps do some ""field coding"" that would be fantastic.  In that case, I just need resources to cover travel and accommodation, something I would also like to have to cover for @anon4187089231."

Dear organisers and festival participants!

It is November! It is getting even hotter for the Festival preparations :)!

Now we should all be decided and booked on the date and location and have a clearer image of the last needs and most importantly be ready to start inviting all the interesting people we want to have there!

Please come to the call on Tuesday the 29th 18:00 to catch up and see if everything is on track and if and anon1138917760 you would need help :).

We are discussiong for example participants signing up, outreach & documention  

Looking forward to seeing you at: [https://zoom.us/j/489971765 ](https://zoom.us/j/489971765)"
1,61024,2019-10-09T15:04:15.589Z,11075,0,11,10,13,0,0,82.2,61024,anon3513118528,anon3513118528,"Who I am is a tough question, as what is relevant to define us actually changes with context. But to make a long story short, I'm a medical doctor by education and I've practiced at the University hospital in Bologna before. I'm also a researcher interested in formal fundamental questions. So, you could say I would be classified as ""interdisciplinary"" by some. I've been working a lot on mathematics and Information Systems studies, mostly in the context of medical ecosystems.

I started at the University of Bologna, I moved very shortly to Portugal and the UK where I had the chance of spending time with wonderful mentors with whom I am still in touch today, and I was a researcher at the University of Maastricht for several years, helping to set up the computational biology research line of the experimental pathology group, among other things. After that I got summoned to CERN in Geneva, to serve as a senior fellow of the Director General for medical applications. In between, I founded the [SCimPulse Foundation](http://www.scimpulse.org/about-us/), which I still direct. I am also part of several scientific organisations and commissions, including (maybe the most relevant about our conversation to come) the working group of NATO for human control over auanon3386180186omous systems.

I was connected to the military in the past from the medical side, because of chance encounters, and in reason of the facts the military are extremely active in healthcare and public health. It so happened that Italy was not represented in the mentioned NATO working group, and someone recommended me. W are tasked with reviewing literature, and technology accidents, in order to identify pitfalls and recommend best practices. We discuss the weaknesses of current approaches to regulations, and design recommendations on engineering auanon3386180186omous systems. It's mostly theoretical. We don't have a lab where we can grow our own evil puppets (LOL), and see whether we can train them out of evilness.

Despite the group having access to classified material in principle, most of the auanon3386180186omous systems related accidents really happen in the public domain, outside of military context, there where any European citizen could be aware of: reports on events in which artificial intelligence systems — which may have been involved in decisions — did not have the expected outcome are published very often and can involve anything from assisted driving systems all the way to decision support systems in healthcare. Civil society on the other side of the Pond has been extremely prolific lately, producing examples of bias in classification of suspects in police investigations, or involving the exclusion of entire population groups from proper follow-up care, or from access to credit.

## Asking the right questions

When you train any machine learning system on a data set, you normally think that you are assigning a task to the machine. In truth this is always slightly different in the sense that the task is encoded in such a way that you award the machine ""gains"" for solving the puzzle through the data that you're giving it. And the machine is actually only trying to get those gains, it is not making any sense of the task. This means that any loopholes in your design will be exploited very efficiently by the machine! When this happens in a gaming context, the researchers react enthusiastically by claiming the machine ""thought outside of the box"", or ""learnt to cheat""... but imagine black people receiving worse follow-up care, because their social context is associated with lower rates of follow-up. Would you be satisfied with a recommender ""guessing"" that being black, or coming from that social context is by itself a predictor of low effectiveness in care practice, thus recommending not to follow-up with your patient?

The data is biased because the system is, the AI simply learnt to give you the most rewarding reply, without care for the amplification of bias (because that was never part of the game for it). 
And what do we, humans, learn from biased data? That it should not be used for classification, that we should use it to focus on pitfalls we want to challenge. 
So the issue boils down to the following: should we ask ML/AI to guess from the data under which category does a fellow human fall, in striving for efficiency, as to exclude her/him from a certain benefit? Or should we rather try to force the machine to assist us in finding effective (not efficient) ways to include them?

Adopting ML/AI today is a bit like a magic trick... but in the sanon1138917760-biz sense, not in the silver-bullet sense. When you go to a magician' sanon1138917760 (say David Copperfield's, I like his art anon2298377336 a lot), he will distract you. And then something else appears in the middle of your supposed attention field that you were not really focusing on. Simply, because you were not paying attention. Similarly, most of the auanon3386180186omous systems applications attract a lot of hype, under the pretence of making something very fast and efficient, and this distract us but what they won't do, and won't let happen.

The problem is not whether you could use the data set. Could you curate the data set to make it unbiased? At face value, you could obfuscate the sensitive variables, and claim the dataset has not bias. But virtual variables can be inferred, even if they are not in a database, just like an exercise of missing values imputation. The big F is known to be able to infer data by crossing information between an external ID and the data of her/his contact on the platform...
Thus, not... the problem does not lie within the data exclusively, it lies with our intended purpose for them and ML/AI: we're just asking questions that we take at face value as if we were proposing them to a sentient entity that would of course interpret them contextually, and we are forgetting that instead when talking to a machine we should questioning the questions we ask, ourselves, for it. The true bias is that we are using extremely effective cheating systems to multiply what we&rsquo;re already doing. Instead of asking ourselves anon1138917760 we&rsquo;re able to improve certain situations. That's the direction where we really want to go, I believe.

For example, I find someone burgling in an apartment, and I have to judge — let's imagine I'm a judge — whether this person will re-offend. To me this becomes a very clear problem. Let's imagine a scenario where we all tend to feel strongly there is a need for intervention: a man who is stalking his ex-wife. Of course, we want to prevent him from reoffending. Right? That's without a doubt. 
Now, as a human, I ask myself: &ldquo;is he likely to reoffend. How can I prevent it?&rdquo; ...there might be ideas about temporary restrictions, coupled with therapy and education, and establishing a redline for a certain time window when re-offense might be most likely...
But when I ask the same question to a machine, this could be shortcut to simply meaning ""anon1138917760 often does re-offense by this category of person get pursuit?"" and recommend me not the best strategy to prevent re-offense and support all the parties move over, it will simply remind me we have to be harder with marginalised individuals with complicated mental-health conditions, and we can be lenient with those individuals who are well off enough to obtain a good legal assistance...

This is not necessarily a tech-only related question, but about the working of the justice system — since this is what we're talking about — the question could be whether are we using the right tools to ensure that people do not re-offend?

The crucial point when ML/AI gets in the picture is the scale. If I am the only judge and I'm working on my own locally, the tools I have to judge are limited, and bias creeps in my practice as I attempt to exploit heuristics to deal with the burden of my task. Luckily, the bias in my heuristic is local, can be made sense of and appear in audits, ...I can ultimately be trained off of some (and maybe into others... nobody is perfect).
But, if I'm deploying the largest system, extremely fast and effective in browsing data, historical information, logistic information, and more: why am I still asking questions as if I were a single person with limited access to information, imagining the system will magically produce the best reply in a context in which I am even avoiding the challenge of aligning my goals with those announced in our Constitutions?

I guess what I am pointing to is that we should work out what questions does AI enable us to ask that we could not ask before? What constructive questions? And what questions need to be avoided or to be reformulated? 
Rather than just answering questions we already have, faster and dumber.

Right now, we are not trying this out for real. The AI revolution at the moment is justified by the idea that we are having machines, doing tasks with less effort, at scale... but we are still in a phase in which we ""humanise"" them, and don't really work well with them.

This is not going to be easy. We don't fully understand human reasoning either. If you look at economics, for instance, the work of Professor Ole Peters, who has identified a formal mistake at the roots of the most common formulation of expected utility theory. Most of the research in this field, if I may, say, is low quality because it tried fitting human thought process to a shakily grounded model of wealth dynamics... thus claiming human irrationality in the most stressful context (a bias, I may say?). Now, when he worked out the theory from the corrected formalism, he figured out that what was considered as irrational decision making actually makes sense, formally. If something as simple as deciding on a bet, between two different types of return dynamics (additive vs multiplicative) has seemed so dramatically complicated to academics for centuries, I might be allowed to state that our assumptions about anon1138917760 we decide in more complicated situations, are wrong. We are often asking ourselves different questions from those we think we are formulating. But once we translate these into machine language, the machine is extremely proficient in engineering precisely the question we're formulating. And this is a short coming on our side, the onus is ours to begin with.

There is research into rethinking the question we ask... more importantly there is research into making explicit anon1138917760 we formulate the question to ask. But you understand that in a moment of hype about ML/AI, this is not a sexy topic, despite being an extremely important piece of work within machine learning and artificial intelligence. And so, most of the discourse around human control over artificial intelligence is focused today on explainability, or reproducibility of the decisions (a historical inheritance of the old days claim that artificial neural networks were too much of a black box). One of the requirements for a new decision to be accepted among us humans is that it has to be convincing in the arguments and assumptions. So, if you have something which predicts the next value of your dice every time you throw it, but you cannot explain anon1138917760 it works, you think it's a trick, right? Exactly like with David Copperfield. You want to understand where information is leaked for the prediction to be faked, if the prediction itself cannot be explained. This is to say explainability is extremely important - some co-workers and I work on the problem of the explainability and interpretability of auanon3386180186omous systems decisions, as well... but it's not enough, it's just half (or maybe I am too optimistic, and it is less) of the work we need... rethinking anon1138917760 we question the world with this new tools is as important, at least.


## Healthcare and AI

Here&rsquo;s an example from the medical field: predictive medicine. Around the 1970s, a number of tools were introduced in the medical field, relatively simple tools that were meant to assist doctors in predicting the likelihood of disease... scoring systems which would assign the person in front of you to a class which shared a certain risk of experiencing some clinically relevant event in the coming 5-10 years.

With progresses in data crunching, the medical community has been expecting these classification systems to become more refined: they can digest more data, they can be more precise in the finesse the classes. That's the expectation of precision medicine: not just knowing that a person has more than 20% likelihood in 10 years of having an event, but distinguishing among those who might have likelihoods of 19%, or 30%, or maybe even 50% . But this hasn&rsquo;t really happened.

This relates a bit to the work of Ole Peters in economics. In the 1970s, with no other tools available, the anon2855557573nuity of the doctors that have been tackling the problem of production has been to use methods that were used, also in other industries. You were guessing that if two patients had a certain relevant trait/profile, they would share the same risk. And because they could only handle a few variables at once — such as for example cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, etc. these profiles where relative simple and ""inclusive"".
When researchers try to enrich these profiles, what's happening is that you meet a new barrier: you are confusing the question concerning the destiny of the person in front of you right now, with the question of the destiny of every similar person. The more precise you get, the more you diverge. 
Imagine you are entering a lottery, and you know that at the end of the day, the lottery pays off (overall distribution of prizes per chance classes vs costs of the entry ticket). So, it's a fair game. But, you may try to play the lottery your whole life without winning any single time. And if you go bankrupt, before winning, then there's no point in knowing it was fair... This happens because it is fair to a set of infinite players, but one player in realistic conditions will never be able to play infinite times...


To continue...

In ecology and evolutionary biology, they have been working on formalizing fitness landscapes, where you interpret the meaning of certain conditions, complex, formal environments. And you can understand anon1138917760 easy or difficult it is to move from one position to another. In economy, there are methods to infer what your likely number of steps are before bankruptcy, starting from a certain point, knowing that the likely the likelihood of gaining or losing at each step is a certain amount. Now, if you could unite this, you could have a very different beast in predictive medicine, instead of trying to collect all the data of everyone and behave in medicine like you do in marketing: if you purchase beer, you are very likely to purchase chips. But there are many more data points in medicine, it&rsquo;s not the same as buying a beer and being likely to buy chips.

And it's not only that there are more data points, it's that it's a really different question. If you look into the general population: people who smoke, in general, have more probability to have lung cancer. This is like marketing. People who purchase a beer are likely to purchase chips. But if you are asking: is Merkel going to have cancer? Now, that's NOT a marketing question. Because in marketing you care about the mass, you want to sell more chips, and even if somebody doesn't buy them, okay, it happens. But with medicine, it makes a huge difference.

If, on average, these markers are more likely to have a disease, do these patients have more risk in the next two years, one year, three years? And being a different question, you will have to work with completely different mathematics. If you&rsquo;d invest in this kind of research in the next 10 years, with these kind of resources, maybe you will be closer to a much more interesting product. But if everything we do with AI looks just like speeding up what we were doing 20 years ago, we will never get to a point of real improvement.

Even if we make these tools auditable, we would be able to learn that the mistake was done in good faith. But is it making it any better for the people?

If you look at ethics in a pragmatic way, you are not really answering the needs.

## Justifying Machine Learning

We may be pushing AI onto the markets, because we are in a rush for &ldquo;supremacy&rdquo; on the market. We did it before. For example, after the diffusion of web marketing systems, medicine, received a lot of investments to dematerialize medical data and make them available on the web. The idea was that this would improve metrics of success, whether this was patients involvement in care, or smoothing out pathways across different services. It was done with precisely the same approach that we are seeing today in machine learning: because it was a success for marketing, it would be a success in medicine: the electronic health records that were mostly designed under the current practice of data collection, that was justified by billing.

But 20 to 30 years after, the impact of electronic health records on medical practice isn&rsquo;t that great: it takes a lot of time out of care. Humans have to put a lot of work to digest the data in a way that the system can deal with them. And this data is taken out of relationships. And if the system is just speeding up the wrong process, the outcome won't be magical.

What is happening right now is that the AI technology in Europe is being accelerated to be used. But were massively risking getting the wrong results, because we're not asking the right questions.

Medicine is one of the fields where there's not really a huge gain by using AI. But a lot of money is being spent both on the development and marketing of it. And this money absorbs other investments. Investing a lot of money trying to train an AI — that money isn&rsquo;t going into training clinicians, not into getting better tools, not invested in your patients, not even in redesigning hospital spaces.

My argument isn&rsquo;t that we shouldn&rsquo;t look into AI, but the true question should be anon1138917760 do we go there? We have never questioned, what's the moment, and what should be the mechanism, the funnel for AI to enter medicine. At the moment, it&rsquo;s a vastly unregulated system. As long as a company claims that they have a product, they can start investing and working on it, absorbing public resources.

Well-established practices should be studied. Questions figuring out anon1138917760 much of a certain practice or investigation is informed by current limitations of the system, and if they are informed by the declared agreed upon goal of the system. These are slightly different problems. We should also look at the states or the communities where they have power: they should try to enforce systems of control, or the introductions of these tools, not systems that are extremely punitive. Our goal is not to make it impossible for innovation to enter, but not to make it too easy.

A good example of this, is what's happening with FDA and the accelerated acceptance of drugs. A recently published review on the drugs that have enjoyed the accelerated acceptance by FDA in the last two decades, uncovered that none of them had any survival gains. So, we created a mechanism where innovative products saving lives enter the market quicker, but in reality, none of them actually did what they were supposed to do.

## Stifling innovation?

We&rsquo;re creating a lot of regulation that contains redundant regulation. It is well intentioned at the European level, but it's countered by national governments. At the same time, a lot of the conversations and negotions don&rsquo;t happen at the policy level, but in discussions about standards.

These are all tricks. Both standards, and most of the policies are tricks. For example the GDPR. A few years ago before it actually entered into force, I knew it would most likely be more challenging to be GDPR compliant for small organization than for the large ones. So, despite the declared goal being &ldquo;we are going to rule anon1138917760 Google and Facebook access your data,&rdquo; we already knew this was going to hinder small organization&rsquo;s activities, and actually a treasure trove for the big ones. And what happened if we look at the reviews, two years later, three years later, that's exactly what happened.

Most of the policy created isn&rsquo;t really to regulate. And it becomes a hinder, because it was the goal from the beginning.

Another problem is lobbying: we don&rsquo;t have a lobbying registry. So, we don't know anon1138917760 much time and gifts our politicians received from lobbying groups.

There is a lot that could be improved about anon1138917760 Europe works. And this is not the nature of policymaking, this is anon1138917760 policymaking is implemented in Europe. That's a problem. It's a systematic problem, but not a principal problem. It's really systematic of the system. The problem lies not in the idea that we want to have policies to regulate issues, the problem is anon1138917760 we do them. And the same happens for standards. Most of the standards are imposed after de facto companies who ruled the market have agreed about it on the phone. I've hardly ever seen any standard being imposed before the large companies were already ready for them.

We are allowing it.

AI could definitely be regulated, and I think it should be regulated. But, there is a misconception of the public about the advantages of research. You will need to consider that you cannot scale up at will, without any consideration for the damage that you can cause. You need to be informed about the risks, you need to have a plan B for the risk. And these doesn't hinder progress. There is no advantage in having research that can scale up, without any consideration for the damage it could cause.

When it comes to biometrics, for example, that we are at a point that we should&rsquo;ve asked questions before, because maybe it's too late now. When authorizing the first research on these at scale, we should have asked &ldquo;what are the implications of generating tools that unify your physical body with your identity.&rdquo; Because in all our societies, your identities are demonstrated by documents you bring, or by relationships you have. They have to be demanded with data to be verified. And your body is not automatically your identification. At the moment you introduce

biometric tools, whether they are effective or not, you are claiming a unification of the soul. This is the first time it is happening in human societies. We never had companies, humans, or states that were able to impose an identity on a body. And we never reflected on what changes these imply for the social contract of our life to live life together. And this is extremely radical. The point is not whether we want to be faster in telling whether you are yourself when you are entering the train. The point is, what are the implications when these permeates all fields of our life? And maybe now it's a bit too late to ask because it's out there.

I mean, there are other ways to try to skew anon1138917760 things are adopted and used. Even China, even while it&rsquo;s currently extremely powerful, it isn&rsquo;t alone on this planet as a result of the market and diplomatic relationships

## The Future of AI

We have to accept that a number of things that were tolerated before — because they were convenient for everyone, the industry, corrupted officers, and whoever — should now be regulated in a slightly different way. We cannot go through a phenomenon — ignoring it scale, wanting this ruling, access to account 413000 tourists for example — and then trying to have similar rules when a country next door is crumbling.

When you try to regulate taxes, as if we were regulating Western immigration for professionals — all the wrong and strange narratives about migrations and sustainability start to emerge. When honestly, it's your mistake for trying to regulate one phenomenon with the rules of something completely different. And the same applies to a single person — whatever his role, whether it's a doctor, or it's a judge, a policeman. We love to have a system where applications scale up extremely fast, basically, on any device around you tomorrow. Even if I as a doctor,wouldn&rsquo;t use it, maybe the hospital is using it, maybe the medical registry are using it.

I don't think there is a short cut. Unfortunately, we have some major powers in this field, but we could frame it. Our best shot, anon1138917760ever, is trying to coordinate a movement independently of the singular individual activity of producing the reflections and conversation around the topic. There is nothing bad in trying to have a bit of activism about things that are fundamentally screwing the way your life and your society work.

And AI, like climate change, may call for something of this scale. Because, it's being treated as &ldquo;just the next technology,&rdquo; but it's completely different from a smartphone. And the smartphone already had a massive impact on society. It's a Trojan horse, under the disguise of making it easier. And it's a terrific tool for speeding up everything we don't like about our society.

It's frustrating. And it&rsquo;s similar to my participation in the working group: we have no guarantee NATO will pick up our recommendations. We express critical opinions suggesting to reflect, and to invest in human resources. Okay, we analyze accidents of the past, for example the famous incident where a ship got lost because the GPS was signaling it was in a different location. This is something that would have never happened to the Vikings, they were reading the stars. Until the 19th century, every sailor needed to be able to read with a compass the stars. Now, they were navigating on GPS, everything is fine, nobody even checked.

And the same can happen with the automatic systems. Invest in people to train their skills, that's the only resource you should really aim at.

At the end of the day, countries can still decide to have a drone with the decision to kill enabled, that works on some biometrics system from China, that will kill the person next door mistakenly during a wedding. As individuals, our power is very limited. But independently of all that, as individuals we are trying to raise is a very neoliberal idea that an individual can change the society.

We should be trained in the mere basics and the foundations, and not use AI as our leader dictating us what to do, but as a nifty tool that could maybe help us.

## Event intro/description: 

Re-Web is a day dedicated to those who wish for a more sustainable infrastructure and system. We aim to explore anon1138917760 we can prepare for a finite, post-climate change earth through practical and hands on action, initiated by conversation.

There will be no speakers, instead we have facilitated conversations, harvested and shared with a larger European network of Edgeryders as part of a distributed festival in order to let the word spread far beyond our physical space, while also finding each other in the flesh.

The intention is to create a network of people who are interested in transforming the world and to have conversations about this, in line with the topics at hand. This event is held as part of a continental festival held in 10 different locations across Europe: https://festival.edgeryders.eu/

The main fields to be focused on is:

- Resilient Tech

- Networks &amp; Communities

- Sustainable Futurism and Solarpunk

SIGN UP TO HOST A SESSION:

https://bit.ly/2MxNI1k

This event is bringing together people who are currently directly involved in building, researching, regulating, monetising and or providing meaningful input into the wider debate around the technologies in question. We want to ensure that every participant leaves the venue having presented and discussed their work with others who can provide meaningful input or connect them with opportunities to further their goals. If this appeals to you, then we would love to have you join us. Just create an edgeryders account and introduce yourself to the community.

This event is part of the NGI Forward project Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, launched by the European Commission in the autumn of 2016. It has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 825652 from 2019-2021. You can learn more about the initiative and our involvement in it at https://ngi.edgeryders.eu

### Format

The event will be divided into two parts:

1. A smaller “crew” get together the day before with the participants in the network who are especially invited.
2. A larger event with multiple tables for hosting conversations. At least three sessions at a time structured as a world cafe with an approximation of 2-3 rounds of conversations ending with a wrap up and a 1-2-4-all.

There will be an opportunity to host conversations until all the slots are filled up.

Before the event there will be a sign up to host conversations. Each sign up will be presented the same way a regular presenter is usually presented at a conference with a short text / video description of them in preparation.

The intention is to create a network of people who are interested in transforming the world and to have conversations about this, in line with the topics at hand.

The event will take place at Lodgatan in Östra Hamnen in Malmö, Sweden with room for up to 200 guests but we are aiming for far less. This event is seen as an iteration with potential for hosting more events in the future.

In the highly resilient society of the future, we’ll have to rely on local resources much more than now. This can be a city-level or neighborhood-level micro-grid or an off-grid house, or probably all of these to have multiple levels of redundancy. I am personally living off-grid and from that experience I can tell that good monitoring of ones energy, water, wastewater, heating and cooling systems is essential for wise resource use and proper functioning. For example, I know that I need 500-700 Wh of photovoltaics energy a day, and that I can cope with at most 10 days of gray sky in winter. That’s where IoT comes in. Network-connected sensors and an evaluation software would combine local consumption data and weather forecasts into behavior recommendations.”

My name is Roberto Trevini Bellini, I have been suggested by a friend to join this very interesting community.

I am impressed reading the names in the panel of speakers for the event on 19/11 in Brussels, and some of the stories shared in the forum. The topic and the angle it is approached are definitely interesting for me personally and professionally, and hopefully I could bring a useful additional point of view to the discussion.

Briefly, my story: after my studies in political sciences and international relations with a focus on human rights, I started working in the field of international development cooperation and humanitarian aid. I have worked for different kinds of organisations (NGOs, Italian Development Agency, European Commission, private companies), and for the last 5 years I have been project manager and trainer/consultant for a consulting company, especially working in the area of training and skills development for the development and humanitarian community, with the European Commission being our main client.

Development cooperation, with all its flaws and contradictory features, is (or should be) fundamentally driven by the goal of fighting inequalities and eradicating poverty. However, after 70 years of international development cooperation, while some progresses have been achieved, it is evident that inequalities are still growing.

The age of the Internet has brought many new opportunities and challenges for the global fight for justice and equality. Technological advances have made knowledge, services and goods far more easily available to a bigger share of global population. However, the control over these resources is increasingly concentrated in the hands of few stakeholders (usually private corporations, and to a lesser extent public entities).

During my university studies, I followed a course about the governance of the global communication and information systems, which raised my awareness about the intimate link between anon1138917760 technology is designed and anon1138917760 much the users are (or aren’t) protagonists of the decision-making processes that impact their daily lives.

For example, I am currently involved in the design and development of an online training programme, funded by the European Commission, to develop the skills and awareness of volunteers engaging in solidarity actions in Europe. We are just starting, but it is already evident that accessibility for everyone is key for the success and usefulness of the programme, as it is the direct involvement of learners in shaping the e-learning contents and modalities.

Another example is the possibility to use geo-spatial data to provide humanitarian or development services with the direct involvement of beneficiaries.

In general, my curiosity is piqued by the possibility to develop technologies that can re-shape development policies and practices towards a needs-based approach instead of a donor-driven approach.

Besides strictly development/humanitarian aspects, I am interested in the role of technology, AI, social networks and IT tools that can empower citizens and foster democracy in an increasingly complex global society.

I look forward to meeting you in Brussels."

There are three kinds of activities:

VOLUNTEERING ACTIVITIES
Individual volunteering lets young people participate in the daily work of organisations and lasts between 2 and 12 months, and in some cases, 2 weeks and up. Participants can volunteer abroad or in their country of residence for projects covering social inclusion, environment, culture, and more.
Volunteering teams are groups of 10-40 young people from at least two different countries who volunteer together for a period of between 2 weeks and 2 months. The costs of accommodation and food are covered. Participants also receive a small allowance for personal expenses.
 
TRAINEESHIPS AND JOBS
Traineeships count as full-time work practice and last between 2 and 6 months – renewable once. They are paid for by the organisation responsible for the traineeship. Trainees develop their personal, educational, social, civic and professional skills.
Jobs are full-time and last between 3 and 12 months. They are paid for by the organisation employing the participant.
Traineeships and jobs can take place in the participant’s country of residence or abroad. If abroad, participants receive a small allowance to help them relocate and settle in a foreign country.
Participants of volunteering activities, traineeships and jobs get online linguistic support, training and mentoring. Their travel costs to and from the project venue are covered.

SOLIDARITY PROJECTS
Solidarity projects are initiated, developed and implemented over a period of 2 to 12 months by at least five young people who want to make a positive change in their local community. Young people who want to run a solidarity project in their country of residence must register in the European Solidarity Corps portal.

You can find some examples here: https://europa.eu/youth/solidarity/solidarity_projects_en

I report here one of them:
#### Paranduskohvik – a repair café in Esanon3386180186ia
The main purpose for the repair café is to make people aware of the negative environmental impacts of the consumer society and to encourage them to maintain the environment. It takes place in a community based makerspace (an open workshop) that provides all neccesary tools that may be needed for fixing all sorts of appliances. People are invited to bring their broken things and together with volunteers try to fix them.

What is relevant to the 19/11 event is the way we are designing and developing the on-line training programme, by involving directly a Youth Panel in reviewing our draft programme."

First, some background on the ethnography team’s (@anon1700913054, @anon3175955029, @anon942358443) process: we read (and reread and reread) the threads posted on the Edgeryders website. Then we develop codes for the threads that cover the content of the conversations taking place. Sometimes these codes are “in-vivo” reflections of the conversations (direct quotes from community members), sometimes they draw from established terms in the (academic) debates about Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Cloud Technologies and other Internet ABC’s (for a detailed description of our coding see [our open codebook ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qERrVXNdwJL_GWsPYJy_makIcvIBmJhwDgP1-SiKgRg/edit?usp=sharing) or feel free to shoot us a message on the platform). To ensure the transparency and methodological rigour of our work, we keep detailed memos in which we explain the decisions we made, identify concerns, and define paths forward. We also have monthly calls in which we discuss difficulties, code-collapsing, and relevant developments in the world of tech and culture (of which we also keep a log in the codebook).

Over the past few weeks the NGI Forward ethnography team has been focussing much of their attention on threads pertaining to issues on the internet, tech and the environment. Our work on these threads has brought up two key insights that will be useful to keep in mind as we develop our methods.

First, those of you community members interacting on these threads appear to largely represent experts in tech; meaning you either seem to be conducting research, developing software, platforms, applications, leading groups of innovators and designers, or engage in activism and journalism around tech issues. This is something to keep in mind both for community managers and ethnographers, as it means we are observing and coding insights based on expert knowledge --  we want to tailor our questions to you towards gaining a deeper understanding of emergent trends, policy, design and innovation. This level of knowledge and engagement on your part means we can ask you more detailed questions, as we are interested in your nuanced analyses of technology issues.

Interestingly (and perhaps conversely), explorations of the relationship between the climate and the internet/tech appears to be in its infancy, and though we are working with a community of experts, there often seems to be a struggle to solidly define key terms and concepts. Despite expertise, or perhaps because of it, specificity in defining technologies and technological areas requiring increased research focus persists across stories, meaning that you might find defining targeted and specific problems around these areas difficult as well. Also of interest, many of you find an underlying tension between acknowledging the ecological costs of the tech industry and findings ways to develop technological tools to protect the climate. These two points seem to characterise a caution on the part of the community when it comes to making bold or definitive claims about tech and the climate. They also indicate a desire to define the terms we are using to make sure we are on the same page, talking to each other about the same things, before we try to give solutions to problems. This may explain why codes thus far are more topical (sketching the broad areas that you have been interested in discussing) than analytical or solutions-focussed. We don’t necessarily see this as an issue, but instead something to track and pay attention to moving forward, as it may tell us all something about the challenges we face and approaches we take when trying to imagine the future of internet technologies.

Several current threads revolve around the notion of Deep Green Tech. While there is a lot of interesting discussion around this concept, it has yet to be clearly defined by the community. From what we can gather so far, Deep Green Tech is similar to Deep Tech, describing mainly startup companies based on substantial scientific research and innovations in tech engineering. Deep Green Tech, broadly, seems to describe technology that is ecologically sustainable, innovative and based on scientific advancements. The concept of Deep Green Tech appears to be a central area of focus for the NGI Forward community, but there seems to be ongoing discussions to clarify confusion around the term’s definition, its ramifications and implications. As a result, we want to help cut through the opacity of these discussions by working with you to understand anon1138917760 you define the term while also asking you to give concrete examples of its application, e.g. in design, research, tech innovation etc. In this way, we think we might all move toward a deeper and more productive discussion of the futures we want to see. 

A notable tension that arises in community discussion on tech and the environment is that between navigating the ways in which tech/internet can help combat climate change and protect the environment and the energy and ecological costs that technological advancement has on the environment. We are interested in further exploring your understandings of this tension. 

Finally, an initial visualisation of the codes pulled from the NGI Forward threads revealed a range of central, yet general themes. This may be again based on the cautious atmosphere of community interactions at this stage, but it also seems to be linked to the absence of concrete examples and personal narratives. We want to start to understand these issues on a personal level, beyond just drawing upon general and objective material. Going forward, we want to gather your expertise by asking more biographically oriented questions, which may help us tease out personal narratives and interpersonal connections around these technologies and help you share what inspires you to think the way you do about these issues. Asking you what motivated you to work in tech, anon1138917760 you use the internet on a daily basis, etc. can help us capture a more dynamic picture of the internet of humans. 

Looking back on Open Care, it’s rare that people have detached and impersonal stories about healthcare experiences. We need to find ways to explore similarly impactful or meaningful avenues around the Internet— to ask you to share stories about experiences or opinions formed from experiences, as well as abstract ideas.

One of the central things we’re taught when doing the interviewing /question asking part of ethnography is to ask our participants to be specific by asking specific questions (this is what community managers on ER are always trying to do) — to move away from the general and ask what you did yesterday, to tell a story about a specific time something affected you, and so on. In Open Care, instead of asking ‘what do you think of healthcare’ it was ‘tell us about a time you interacted with the healthcare system— what did it look like? How did you feel? What issues came up for you?’

If we can find such parallels on the Internet (rather than ‘what does the future look like to you’?), instead ‘tell us about the last time something online upset you, and why?’ (or other questions along those lines, around sustainability for example) we might all get a deeper understanding.

In short, we hope to move away from asking anon1138917760 you think and feel in general and toward asking you about specific experiences, recollections that prompted emotional reaction, opinion forming, or action from them. We can't wait to hear more of your fascinating thoughts and experiences on these issues!"

First, a methodological point: the very high modularity that appears in the first picture (which represents _all_ co-occurrences) is an artifact of SSNA itself. The cliques like the one highlighted in blue are induced by a single, dense post which is coded with 5-10 codes, which then, by definition, form a clique. On the other hand, the fact that the graph is connected (all nodes in the same in connected component) is not artifact of SSNA. The graph that has a more meaningful interpretation is the second one, where only the edges between codes that co-occur at least twice are preserved. 

[quote=""anon942358443, post:1, topic:11320""]
community members find an underlying tension between acknowledging the ecological costs of the tech industry and findings ways to develop technological tools to protect the climate. These two points characterise a vagueness, reluctance and caution on the part of the ER community when it comes to making bold or definitive claims about tech and the climate, which may explain why codes thus far are more topical (sketching the broad areas that community members have been interested in discussing) than analytical or solutions-focussed.

It's just an intuition, but I expect this finding to be representative of the broader debate, not just of the NGI Forward community.

n short, we are missing the meat of these issues because users are not engaging with them on a personal level and instead are drawing on general and ‘objective’ material.

I have a question regarding anon1138917760 we should try to gently push the development of a certain type of post creation as you touched on here. I fully understand the importance of the connection of personal experiences and examples to the abstract discussions. The texts that are developed from the interviews such as this one: https://edgeryders.eu/t/can-tech-design-for-survivors-anon1138917760-sex-violence-and-power-are-encoded-into-the-design-and-implementation-of-data-ai-driven-sexual-misconduct-reporting-systems/11193 can provide this especially since @anon2855557573 did a great job getting it out. However, I would like to ask the Ethnography team (@anon942358443) on their opinion on the influence of the length of a post on its ability to create ongoing interwoven discussion. Do you have any insight on that? There are certainly posts that are too short to lead to meaningful discussions, but could it also be that if a post gets too long and dense, that kind of decreases the ability of the community to engage into a discussion of the different aspects since the discussion will develop along the lines of the first few comments which in return will become the source of following comments which will mainly zoom in on one aspect of the original post and morph that on further?"

I think what might be useful is to go to the Open Care page and sort the posts by most replied, and look at the posts themselves --- check them out for length, detail, and content. If you get people talking about focused, specific things, chances are the length won't be too long (and not too short, as long as the question is asking for a story or experience or example). I find that usually the question shapes the answer length, so asking the right scale and scope of question is key."

Regarding length: I think that after about the first paragraph, and maybe just halfway through it, people tend to spot the writer their attention one sentence at a time.  If something is interesting enough, the reader will stick with it, but even then often not to the end.

This is a big reason why journalistic writing was developed and why you shouldn't ""bury the lede.""  They knew for years that most reader don't go ""past the fold"" in a newspaper story unless they are on a long bus ride or in a waiting room.  It is not so different online really.  Except for the concept of click bait, which didn't exist before.  I think a lot of bloggers mislead with their headlines and then take as long as possible to get to the point so they will get a better impression count for their ad revenue.  Also, they might just be lousy writers.

I know I was for a long time.  Learning to write clearly and succinctly in this semi-spontaneous  posting medium, while bringing out a compelling story worthy of a reader's attention takes skill and practice.

But I very much like the exhortation that we continue to try to bring out more the personal side of people.

I think there are a couple of challenges in doing it.  One is that the ER community uses the platform for anon2298377336 business-like or project-specific purposes.  It is not a social place or a hangout.  This is by design for the most part, and just clearly not the preference of the main participants.  The ER community does a lot of getting to know each other, socializing, meeting up, etc. but it is almost entirely offline and in-person.  I think this works well for the regulars, but does not tend to create that encouraging of an atmosphere for comfortable personal sharing (stories) as a default.  For my part, I try to throw a story or an anecdote into every post I make if I have one i think is worthwhile.  And encouraging more of it in others is something I agree we can do to help enrich the dialogue.

The other challenge besides this ER platform not really being seen as a hangout, is the nature of the subject matter in NGI. Amelia describes the problem well. Experts likes to share their expertise.  But we have two kinds of experts here: policy and engineering.  I think the engineering participants do inform their work with what they see as an ethos compatible with NGI goals, but like the policy people, they come in and say something then go back to their project.  Maybe asking for updates is a good approach to keep them engaged.

The policy experts for sure want to see things made that reflect NGI principles, but there seem to not be many of those projects out there to point to.  Finding and highlighting them whenever we find them is, I think, one of the things the EC would like us to be doing here.  Generally, the policy experts, and I see myself as one of them at least to some degree, point out the problems.  I think we have done a good amount of that here.

Tunneling our way to solutions or attempts at solutions or raising the profile of individuals who the EC ought to know more about are big parts of what makes this project worthwhile.

I do think that the people interviewed by Peter and Zenna are all interesting and they do tell their own stories in those talks.  Interviews are of course one of the best ways to draw them out of people.

As for deep green tech: very challenging indeed to define it and we did try to get some better definition of what the term even means specifically, but I think we need to try to get more clarity there.

And I like Amelia describing tensions inside some of these issues.  I think none of us believe that tech is going to ""save"" us, but I also think that if we did not have at least some belief in clever tech solutions we would not be involved in these conversations.  I know I feel pretty conflicted about it myself."

## Oskar van Deventer – Self-sovereign identities

Many organizations are administration factories. Every time you interact with them, they ask you for information, which then they process (name, email, phone number).

There is a different way to do it. People have an information wallet, and orgs ask the wallet for exactly the information they need, not more. People can comply, or decline, or even report excessive requests for information. This is a SSI.

This ecosystem consists of issuers, holders, and verifiers of identities. Oskar has a demo based on the story of a patient ordering drugs online. The eSSIF-Lab EU project provides funding for technology development and business applications based on this idea. The first open call is going out in early 2020.

Q: How would the data storage work? Some kind of citizen wallet, but anon1138917760 do you implement it?

A: The concept we are working on lives on issuer DBs, accessed through a phone app.

Q: What prevents service providers from asking for all of the individual&rsquo;s data, and the person accepts because she needs the service?

A: This is my nightmare. You cross the Chinese or US border, and then some kind of data vacuum cleaner empties your wallet. This might require issuers policy, stating once and for all what can be done with those data. But I do not yet know anon1138917760 to solve it.

## Gaëlle le Gars

I want to share with you anon1138917760 the Commission sees this issue now.

There are two major trends that have undesirable consequences. One is social credit scoring. In Europe we are likely to see a &ldquo;consumer scoring&rdquo; version of it. Companies share information on you as a consumer, determining whether you are an undesirable customer. Undesirables are ostracized, made to wait for help, unacknowledged. This is illegal, but the infrastructure is there (it is GAFA), so we suspect this is happening.

The other trend is the integration of identification databases across the EU on the grounds of police and justice administration. There is a regulation for interoperability of these DBs across the EU, including a lot of info (like: travel information).

However, there are also two opportunities. One is e-government applications; the other is that this is now a centerpiece of EU policy, so things can happen to defuse these risks.

Q: How does EIDAS play into these scenarios?

A: (Loretta) It is time that you people – not the Smart City crowd, not the IoT crowd – take control of this issue. There is something profoundly human about freedom from surveillance, and identity is political. Speak up, and apply for funding if you have ideas to implement in this space.

[Round of presentations follows]

## Maria Rautavirta: Human centric data economy

* Re-using personal data creates new business opportunities
* But people should be included in the decisions about what is done with their data.
* Currently it&rsquo;s mostly open data that are being exchanged. All other data does not travel much, in sits in data lakes with a big lock at the door.

Finland has come up with Data principles to enable more data exchange. They are human centric, thriving (efficiency gains from exchange) and balanced (divide fairly the benefits of the gains). There are six principles: Access, Share, Act, Innovate, Trust, Learn, all this by default. They are available at https://dataprinciples2019.fi .

## anon1277364675 Bonelli: wrap up

The problem of identity is central, not only in policy but in philosophy and the arts. It is a complex problem, but there is a core simplicity. In logic, A=A: an entity coincides with itself. When I pass the border between Finland and Russia, a frontier guard looks at my passport, and validates that I am anon1277364675. Data in the passport matter, but maybe it is the validation that matters most. Now we are discussing about other methods of validation, algorithmic. Loretta said that identity is political; and politics, as defined by Aristotle, is definitely not a science, more like a kind of art.

## Loretta Anania's suggestions for wrap up

1. Where is the ecosystem?
2. Oskar&rsquo;s nightmare scenario: &ldquo;wallet vacuum cleaners&rdquo;.
3. Gaëlle&rsquo;s two risks and two opportunities.
4. The opportunity to build offered by the NGI initiative.

We agree to anything, when that unlocks a service we need. Imagine you had one of these amazing data wallets, allowing you to authorize which services can access which personal data. Now imagine that your bank, or your keysanon3386180186e social networking service, told you ""I want access to _all_ of your data, or else you don't get an account from me."" What are you going to do? You cannot function in modern society without a bank account (or, some would say, a Facebook account). So you agree. You agree to _anything at all_. That's not because of any technological issue. It's _because you have no power_.


We have been in a similar situation before. In the early 20th century, for-profit companies operated public utilities like energy, water, rail transport. This happened because of technological reasons: building two aqueducts in the same city is wasteful. The first company that builds an aqueduct can obtain monopoly of water provision in that city, and maintain it forever. This was called a [natural monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly). Today's ""network externalities"" provoke a similar effect, and for similar reasons.
 
This situation led to massive profits, driven by the power imbalance between monopolist providers and users; to the exclusion of less affluent users; and to rent extraction, pushing potentially viable businesses into the red.  Europe responded with antitrust legislation, with its array of policy tools: nationalizations, tight regulation by specialized agencies, and direct provision, with public sector actors starting their own water, energy, and transport companies. Municipalism played a major role here: where the state would respond too slowly, or not at all, cities stepped into the breach, at least in some countries (including Italy). It is maybe not a coincidence that the strongest critical voice claiming to reduce the power of business was [Francesca Bria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Bria)'s – Europe's digital municipalist-in-chief. 

It comes down to game theory. If I had the personal data wallet right now, and my bank would refuse to accept it, saying ""nah, you have to fill this online form""; or if it _did_ accept it, but only under the condition that they get access to the whole thing... I would consent. What can I do? Now, if the European institutions owned a trusted operator that _would_ accept that data wallet in an equitable way, now I could tell my bank ""fair enough, I'll take my business elsewhere"". This way, the game has a completely different equilibrium. 

Conclusion: maybe, in order to get this stuff adopted, you need antitrust policy. Makes sense?"

I was thinking about anon1138917760, ultimately, any kind of sanctions against multinational companies providing digital services could be enforced.

It seems that if the digital service providers have contracts with states then the obvious choice would be international arbitration.

But apparently this requires them to have signed a contract with a mandatory arbitration clause in it (where both parties have agreed to settle via arbitration in case of a dispute). Which I am guessing that in the EU this hasn't happened? Just a thought."

If they are on the network as regular peers they are just extending the mesh. Even if they intercept messages on the network, those messages are end to end encrypted, and not even the secret service can break good end-to-end encryption.

There are things they could potentially do though, just with the information gained from knowing anon1138917760 the messages are flowing, even though they couldn't know the contents. There are technologies that stop that from happening – like SSB, in which everyone gets and propagates every message of everyone they are connected to, but even the identity of the recipient is encrypted."

Another thing a regime can do, is to find a few people who use that technology, and sentence them to 20 years in prison. Then write about this in the newspapers: tech forbidden, 20 years in prison. Then find more people, put in prison, broadcast in the media. Repeat. Until people stops using the tech, for fear of ending up in prison (or worse)."

_Text of the audio conversation with Zenna Fiscanon204016368 and Noah Schoeppl_
_Recorded September 2019 for Edgeryders and NGI Forward_

_Zenna: _
_Welcome to the first episode of the Edgeryders podcast with Zenna or anon215618117 for ""human centered internet."" Today, we are interviewing Noah Schoeppl. And the conversation will be exploring Noah's visions and thoughts of a utopian internet, as well as some of Noah's history. We've been talking anon2298377336 a bit ahead of time. And we recently got introduced each other. And it was kinda with a shebang and a lot of checkboxes. _

_To give it a round about exploration of what you've explored previously, is it legal infrastructures mixed with AI and ethical complications that come thereof. And you've explored ethical hacking, and working with radically open security, as well as politicy, psychology, law, economics and programming and many more it seems like, and now you're entering a master's program at Oxford, in like, two weeks. Yeah. To start off, if we if we go about it from a chronological order, where would that lead us to start?_

_Noah:  _
_I'm Noah. And I think my journey started as a politically aware and interested human being anon2298377336 young, I was 12 or so when I really someanon1138917760 caught fire for a topic that now is actually all over the world and more in the headlines, but back then was not so much. And it's really just the question: anon1138917760 can we get to a world with hundred percent renewable energy as fast as possible. And that was my utopia, that that really inspired me and got me going. _

_And I came from a small town in southern Germany, and I started to, travel to different places, protests and all these things. This got me in touch with research institutions, and political institutions. And then there came a second phase at some point, because I realized, well, someanon1138917760 in the end, in all these discussions that I had with politicians and lobbyists and activists, in the end, you know, like, we can all discuss this, and anon1138917760 there's an ecological imperative anon1138917760 we need to change our world, due to the ecological boundaries of our world. But in the end, still, the economic argument wins someanon1138917760. It always does in the political arena, or tends to, and I was really frustrated by that. And so I was like, Well, if the economic argument wins, maybe I should learn better anon1138917760 it works. And I really got into business ethics, and asked: anon1138917760 can we reimagine anon1138917760 the economy and anon1138917760 businesses work, because to challenge that paradigm of that it's only about money making, and it's much more about human thriving and the common good. And these are the contributions that companies should aim for. _

_So from there on, I realized what drives companies and what really shapes them, because companies can become really slow to develop there as well. The single force that right now is changing companies and the economy most is technology. And so if we get this one right, if we can get the technological change right, then that's also a really good opportunity to just change anon1138917760 our economy works, and anon1138917760 our society works for the better. So like technology is what's right now is the moving pieces that right now are shaping new things, and our generation has the opportunity to co-shape these technological changes. And I think that's opportunity I want to take so that we can use the technology together with our human insights and intuitions and values to make a more humane society and economy._

_Zenna:  _
_So I'm, I'm curious. Now, we've talked a anon2726675500 bit about this before about the technology being power. And we also talked about anon1138917760 Oxford was Hogwarts. And coders are the wizards up today. Framing it in that perspective, is an egalitarian world something worth fighting for? And if it is, what is technology and the knowledge thereof, what place does that have?_

_Noah:  _
_In generally I find egalitarian philosophy very appealing, particular, John Rawls' idea that first of all, freedoms should be equal, and everybody should have some basic civil liberties. And then when we look at material conditions, that to be very rough again, the different principle according to John Rawls is that an unequal division of resources is only legitimate, if it actually benefits those that are least well off. And I think, right now we're definitely at a point I would say, where we don't justify our current system is not justified by that, by that standard, in the sense that we use technology often not centered on the most vulnerable people in our communities and societies._

_Also Silicon Valley culture, even if it purports to save the world, startups get bought up by venture capitalists, which then again are owned by the ones that already currently own the world. Self-feeding. Exactly. And again, I find it sad that all this beautiful technology that could be built into really meaningful things in the end, nobody says that all the social media companies we have now or all those giants needed to go to the direction they had to it was just that's the society in which technology arrived was one in which these kinds of innovations were immediately put under profit, maximizing pressure._

_Zenna:  _
_And copyright?_

_Noah:  _
_And copyrights is also one part of it. Yes, I could imagine very different ways of arriving there. But then again, I think my my philosophy that I developed around this is kind of really being willing to think, very radical, very big about anon1138917760 things could be different, but then really starting from where we are right now. So I really don't like just complaining about anon1138917760 things should be very different. I didn't like only like talking about business ethics, but I also got into social entrepreneurship and founded companies myself and tried to not just talk about anon1138917760 business should be run differently, but I tried to do it. And it's hard. _

_Zenna:  _
_just as a tidbit, what's goal that you found from your time in there, and I don't mean, goals as in capitalist values, but as in, what did you find that you brought with you on your new journey?_

_Noah: _
_I think generally, the, the methodologies of business can often be very useful if they are used to different ends. So like, basically, the idea of Muhammad Yunus is to find a social business, to use business means for social ends to solve real social problems, and not for the kind of problems they've been conventionally associated with. One more additional thought that helped me to develop my own philosophy that I call pragmatic idealism. At this point, I can summarize in three models: first, hope without critical thinking, is just naivety, but critical thinking without hope is just cynicism. And then the second idea is: confidence without humility, is just arrogance but then humility, without confidence, is sheepishness._

_Zenna:  _
_And that's your own personal philosophy for anon1138917760 you see yourself throughout the world?_

_Noah:  _
_More people that inspired us include Maria Popova, Bulgarian writer, but also many others. And then like the last sentence kind of is more like the synthesis of it all I would say, which is pragmatism without idealism is just opportunism. But idealism without pragmatism is just wishful thinking. So that's kind of my, that's my philosophy. That kind of is the goal, I would say, I found that pragmatism and idealism need to work together. Yeah, the, I think, especially like, the first two are probably more inspired by other people. Pragmatism and idealism, they live in the space between the two. And so really have ambitious goals, but also be really pragmatic, where you start with it._

_Zenna: _
_if we go back to the origin of the ambitious goals, so to speak, if you were to start sketching out the image of what those ambitious goals for, let's say, if you want to reshape the internet, plural, What would that look like for you?_

_Noah:  _
_I don't have one overarching one but I think I have several different utopian visions. I took an international relations course in my undergrad degree in Amsterdam in social sciences and I was thinking about, well, anon1138917760 does international relations in global politics fit into cyberspace that we increasingly live in, and the internet and, and just writing and trying to combine this global politics theories with these new technologies, and then I just for some reason, wrote these words like cyber peace and cyber war. And I just noticed that my computer for some enough reason underlined cyber peace as like an unknown word, but not CYBER WARS. I looked up in different word processing programs, none of the knew cyber peace, but all the knew cyber war. And so it was just like, Well, that's interesting, the vocabulary that we have in the conceptual space of the internet, is we conceptualize it as war, we don't even know anon1138917760 to talk about it in terms of peace, because we don't have a word for it. And just that obvious asymmetry that it someanon1138917760 needs to be a very aggressive and violent place, apparently out there. And this is the language we use. That kind of made me think there's some utopia missing. When you look at what is cyber peace, maybe we look at peace in the real world first. There were always like ideas of world peace, they've always existed, but someanon1138917760 we've not achieved it yet. So just one very common idea of world peace was developed by Immanual Kant, a philosopher, who in 1795 wrote an essay called 'perpetual peace', with the simple hypothesis that the states with a republican constitutions so democracies, should all just guarantee each other security. And when they do that, then we could have an ever expanding union of peace, because nobody would ever attempt to attack such a block of countries. And we could have an ever expanding unit of peace._

_Zenna:_
_One thing that's been discussed recently, especially in the realms of internet and internet infrastructures, is the issue of centralization. In that kind of utopian image of a block of peace, one can say a block of Empire, which would then set the frame for the rest of the world._

_Noah _
_Absolutely agree. Kant said we don't need a centralized contract or institution for this. We don't need a treaty for this, this would just emerge out of enlightenment, basically, enlightened actions of, of individuals and countries, again, 18th century philosophy maybe doesn't completely explain the internet. But I think there are some interesting things when you actually apply it. _

_And again, because the internet is a very different beast. If you look at the long term trends, again, we have not achieved real peace. But overall, we live in a more peaceful world than ever before. And I think we should continue to have progress. Because right now, when we speak about the internet, we just speak a lot about, like, there's a lot of cybercrime and a cyber war between the countries and all that. And I think that what we really should aim for is really to have this this utopian vision and anon1138917760 I think that can actually happen in cyberspace, much more than in real world, think cyberspace is actually could be a much more peaceful place, then the world we live in physically. And that is because of the different dynamics of security in the cyberspace. It's very asymmetric. And it's very different from other security, thinking of like 20th century Cold War thinking, which often has been the only dominant security paradigm has been applied to the internet, because the common story is that on the internet you you don't know who's your attacker. Basically, it's very difficult to do attribution of attackers. So you just want to develop your own offensive capability and hack everyone. The superpowers that are emerging, are basically trying to copy this old patterns into this new world. First of all, I don't think that's anon1138917760 it's going to work out. And second of all, I don't think it's desirable, and it doesn't work that way. And that's because because of this asymmetry in the internet, that you don't know who your attacker, attribution is very difficult. So you can't retaliate, even if you have offensive capabilities, right? The offensive capability you have is not a deterrence against somebody else's attack, which in the physical world is very different. If you have a nuclear bomb, you know, the other person is not going to bomb you because you can bomb them back. This logic of the Cold War in that sense doesn't work anymore in the internet. A second reason for that is basically you can destroy somebody else's offensive capability by building up your own defenses. So if you do really good, actually security for yourself, and if you do security research, and you find vulnerabilities and you find zero days, then you can basically destroy the offensive capabilities of others because they rely on these vulnerabilities. And so, you know, if I have a nuclear bomb, just because you build some protection doesn't mean I don't have a nuclear bomb. But if I have a zero day, which is basically an exploit to which there is no fixes yet, and you close that, that gap, that I don't have a bomb anymore, I don't have a weapon anymore. So basically, you can take away somebody else's offensive capability by building good defenses. I think these dynamics have not been fully understood by policymakers._

_Zenna:  _
_Is that something you would call sign of peace? You can build up defenses and by having a safety rather than offensive?_

_Noah: _
_Yeah, I don't think security must always be so state-centric, my vision for cyberpeace is that, basically everybody in a certain union, and it doesn't have to be a contractual union, which works towards building collective defenses. A global norm for zero day reporting, that countries that join and when they report zero days they never improve not only their security, but security of everybody else. And again, like many people might say that sounds so super idealistic. And I don't think it is, I think there are very pragmatic reasons to do so. Because if you're part of this defensive union, then you will be much safer than if you're if you don't share any of you zero days, and you twist try to get keep and build your own offensive capabilities for all the reasons that I've named, because on offensive capabilities can be destroyed by enemies, and because of having offensive capability is not a deterrent against attacks._

_Zenna:  _
_So if you have a union, there must also be an 'them' outside of it? Is that what you imagine, for a utopian internet?_

_Noah:  _
_Generally, I would apply this kind of Kantian idea that in the end, we want to live on a peaceful planet or in a peaceful cyberspace. My vision is that we, in the end have a safe space in the internet and we start by creating small safe spaces, and they start expanding until in the end, hopefully they cover everything. There will always be cyber attacks. But we can minimize the impact and increase the integrity of our of everybody's experience in the internet by for example, having a global norm for zero day reporting. And I find what I like about the global norm for zero day reporting is it encourages everyone to contribute to everyone's security, because you can't just close the zero day vulnerability for yourself, you do it for everyone. And at the same time, the only 'them' that basically you create is the people that don't want to work together to make everyone's experience safer. And the 'them' is basically the people that want to keep the exploits to themselves. Only the people that kind of want to be able to really attack other people systems are then kind of that that will be against. I do not have a very clear institutional setup anon1138917760 this would work, because obviously, it's very difficult to control these kind of things. So I don't it's not fully developed. But my point is more this narrative shift from we talked about a place where there's a lot of war happening, cyber war, to a place where cyber peace is possible, and where we should make sense of peace, not cyber war._

_Zenna: _
_Whose responsibility is it to make this shift happen?_

_Noah: _
_I think in the end, it's everyone's, but I think, if I should put my hope on, for example, individual institutions, I think institutions that are very well set to do this, or where I have realistic hope for this is the European Union. So if the European Union were to start such a project, where it said, okay, we, as a group of countries decided we want to start a norm, that what everyone ought to report zero days, because it's better for everyone to do that. I think that could be very powerful. And I know that the current administration, for example, in the US, which obviously controls the most powerful capability there, is not going to willing to do that. But I hope that that could change given also the large trajectory of history, I hope that it is possible. Also for other countries, I hope that they that in the same way that we didn't think it seemed impossible to ever start a counter proliferation movement in the nuclear age. And it seemed that we will for eternity, always just create more bombs to kill each other. We now actually live a world where there's still too many bombs, but at least less than 50 years ago. And in the same way, I have a hope that in 50 years, I know it's a long shot and it's not going to happen overnight. And right now, all the talks on the UN level are basically non-existent on this topic. So it's I really hope that we could live in a world where we have less, not more attacks and more integrity of everybody's devices._

_Zenna: _
_You've been working a bit with AI and machine learning, and specifically on the focus of whether it's ethical, if placed in a legal system. Do you want to expand on that?_

_Noah:  _
_Yeah, of course. So I think kind of like that was my work that I started, or did two years ago that I  talked about this narrative shift to cyber peace. And what I didn't like about it is that it was apart from that it was state centric, and that there were many practical problems with it and very long shot, it was still defensive, it was still like it's talking about my utopia is security or safety, which is still something like the absence of violence. That's the problem with peace. Also, you know, it's not medicine super positive, it's only that bad things are not there. And so I was like, I want something more positive than that. And and that's then where I got also more into this AI space. And because I think they're really there is opportunity to positively shape human thriving in many ways. And to unlock this potential that we need to avoid many risks that are often also discussed and that are very real. And the as I said, also, I wonder, and they I feel I don't have this super clean utopia, because someanon1138917760 every utopia that involves machines that can do more than we do, in some sense, apparently ends up being a dystopia sometimes. And so we have to still do a lot of work on which utopia, we actually want out there._

_Zenna: _
_ In your utopia, does AI exist?_

_Noah: _
_I'm a pragmatic idealist. So my someanon1138917760 my ideals are also based on my pragmatism. And I think there is not a world possible where we get rid of AI. I don't know if you heard about the unabomber, who's like a, like a guy who started basically bombing scientists, because he believed that the progress of science and technology would destroy human society. And given that I don't think that's a viable path that we will have, that we will basically live with less technology, then the question is, anon1138917760 can we shape the current trends and the current technologies that are rising to human benefit? And also maybe sometimes also, anon1138917760 can we consciously decide not to use them?_

_But overall, I'm convinced that we will get machines that will be better than humans at many tasks that currently only humans can do. Given that that's going to come, the question is, anon1138917760 do we want to do that? I think their biggest problem are, exactly about human centrism. So anon1138917760 can we make sure that they align with our values. Like that's a long term perspective, I would say all this question, which is kind of like AI governance questions that says when, for example, pioneered by Nick Bostrom, the whole ideas of what do we do when general AI actually is smarter than humans? I think these are super valuable questions to research. _

_But then there's also the short term questions, and that's what we're after dealing with these important questions of, if we already today have for example, a system that makes legal decisions, for example, in an administration and that public administration, what laws do we want to be imbued into that? Do we think it's just fine if there's some human mandate and humans and some democratically elected institution decides now we want this to be done by an AI? Or do we also think there needs to be some outputs that need to be in some material sense fair, as it just if it's if it's cheaper and faster do we just accept it? Or do we also want to actually be able to understand the process to be accessible for humans, because then many advanced machine learning programs, currently, they're black boxes for us, so we can't really understand them. _

_And the other question is, well, if it's trained on any human data, human centric data, also in that sense, then it's going to take human vices with it, and it could even aggregate them and exaggerate them. And so yeah, there's a lot of open questions, and I don't really have full answers to those yet. But my utopia is just I can only explain it in very abstract terms at this point, because there's a lot of research and thinking and testing and acting to be done on this field. But right now, it's to reap the benefits to avoid the risks, and to make sure that we humanize the technology that we live with, in the sense that in the sense that we really challenge also what it means to be human for ourselves, because I don't think we know right now what it means to be human. And if we first figure out like, or if we figure out what it means to be human, then we can also tell when we want technology to do to help us to thrive._

I'm Edgeryders' community journalist and have taken the liberty to edit the transcript. If you feel like this explains who you are, you can replace it as the first post here:

I&rsquo;m a social entrepreneur and technology researcher, currently enrolled as an MSc candidate at the Oxford Internet Institute. I&rsquo;m interested in the global governance of emerging technologies, and anon1138917760 we could possibly shift the narrative shift from &ldquo;cyberwar to cyber peace&rdquo; as a practical utopia and a guiding north star, including internet-related technologies such as the governance of AI.

My journey of becoming politically aware started when I was anon2298377336 young, I was about 12. I became passionate about figuring out anon1138917760 we can get to a world with hundred percent renewable energy as fast as possible. And that was my utopia, it really inspired me and got me going. It&rsquo;s a topic that is actually now all over the world and in the headlines, but back then, it wasn&rsquo;t so much.

Coming from a small town in southern Germany, I travelled to different places for protests. And this what connected me to research and political institutions. But at some point, I wondered what impact have those discussions with politicians and lobbyists and activists really? In the end, anon1138917760 do both the ecological imperative and the changes we need to make globally bound by our ecological reality?

Unfortunately, the economic argument has won until now. And within this political arena, I became very frustrated with it. But it also made me think: if the economic argument wins, maybe I should learn better anon1138917760 it works. That is anon1138917760 I got into business ethics, asking the question: anon1138917760 can we reimagine anon1138917760 the economy and anon1138917760 businesses work, to challenge the money making paradigm, moving towards about thriving humans and the common good — and which contributions companies should aim for.

Companies can slow down due to technological developments. So, I realized that if we can get the technological change right, it could also be a good opportunity to change anon1138917760 our economy and society work for the better. Because it&rsquo;s technology which are the moving pieces shaping new things, and our generation has the opportunity to co-shape these technological changes. That&rsquo;s the opportunity I want to take, to use technology together with our human insights, intuitions and values, to create a more humane society and economy.

## A Tech Philosophy

I find egalitarian philosophy very appealing, particular, John Rawls&rsquo; idea that freedoms should be equal and that everybody should have some basic civil liberties. When we look at material conditions and apply anon1138917760 unequal division of resources is only legitimate if it actually benefits those that are least well off — a different principle formulated by Rawls — we can see that our current system isn&rsquo;t justified. It isn&rsquo;t upholding that standard, in the sense that the technology is often not centered on the most vulnerable people in our communities and societies.

With regards to Silicon Valley culture: start-ups often purports to save the world, but are bought by venture capitalists, which then again are owned by those who already own the world. It&rsquo;s self-feeding.

I find it sad that all this beautiful technology, which could be built into incredibly meaningful solutions, have to &ldquo;make a profit.&rdquo; For example, social media companies — they innovated, but were immediately pressured to become profitable. The copyright debate falls exactly within this sphere, although I could imagine we arrived here through different paths.

The philosophy I&rsquo;ve developed around these issues, means we really have to be willing to think radically different about anon1138917760 to make changes, in a massive way.

I don&rsquo;t like to merely complain about anon1138917760 things should be very different. I didn&rsquo;t like to only talk about business ethics, so I also dived into social entrepreneurship and founded companies myself. I tried to not just talk about anon1138917760 business should be run differently, but do it. And that&rsquo;s anon2298377336 difficult.

The methodologies of business could be useful when applied to different ends. For example, Muhammad Yunus idea revolves around the idea that you found a social business, and use business means for social ends to solve real social problems — not for the kind of problems they&rsquo;ve been conventionally associated with.

One more additional thought that helped me to develop my own philosophy, is what I call pragmatic idealism: hope without critical thinking, is just naivety, but critical thinking without hope is just cynicism; confidence without humility, is just arrogance, but humility without confidence, is sheepishness; and pragmatism without idealism is just opportunism, but idealism without pragmatism is just wishful thinking.

I found that pragmatism and idealism need to work together: we need to have really have ambitious goals, but also be really pragmatic about where we start.

## Reshaping the internet

I have several different utopian visions on anon1138917760 to reshape the internet. During my undergrad degree in Amsterdam in Social Science, I wondered anon1138917760 international relations in global politics fits into the cyberspace which we are increasingly living in. How do we combine global politics theories with these new technologies. That&rsquo;s when I came up with the idea of moving from cyber war to cyber peace.

I noticed that my computer for some reason didn&rsquo;t recognize cyberpeace as one word, but did recognize cyberwars. I looked it up in different word processing programs, and none of them knew cyberpeace, but all knew cyberwar. That was an interesting revelation: the vocabulary that we have in the conceptual space of the internet, is conceptualizing it as war, we don&rsquo;t even know anon1138917760 to talk about it in terms of peace, because we don&rsquo;t have a word for it. That obvious asymmetry means that cyber is someanon1138917760 linked to a very aggressive and violent place. Which made me realize there&rsquo;s some utopia missing.

To define cyber peace, we should first examine peace in the real world. The idea of world peace has always existed, but someanon1138917760 we&rsquo;ve not achieved it yet. Immanual Kant argued in his 1795 called Perpetual Peace, that the states with a republican constitutions — in other words democracies — should all guarantee each other security. When they would do so, we would have an ever expanding union of peace, because nobody would ever attempt to attack such a block of countries. And we could have an ever expanding unit of peace.

Decentralization is another important part. Kant argued that we don&rsquo;t need a centralized contract or an institution, or a treaty: it would emerge out of the enlightened actions of individuals and countries.

But perhaps 18th century philosophy doesn&rsquo;t completely explain the internet, as it is a very different beast. If you look at the long term trends, we have not achieved real peace. But overall, we live in a more peaceful world than ever before. And I think we should continue to have progress in this sphere. When we speak about the internet, we often discuss cybercrime and a cyber war between countries. But what we really should aim for is to have a utopian vision

## From Cyderwar to Cyberpeace

I believe cyberspace actually could be a much more peaceful place than the world we live in physically. That&rsquo;s because of the different dynamics of security in cyberspace. It&rsquo;s very asymmetric. And it&rsquo;s very different from the 20th century Cold War thinking, which often has been the only dominant security paradigm applied to the internet. The superpowers which are emerging, are basically trying to copy these old patterns into this new world.

But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s anon1138917760 it&rsquo;s going to work out and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s desirable, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way. That&rsquo;s because because of the internet&rsquo;s asymmetry. A commonly heard argument is that on the internet you don&rsquo;t know who your attacker is. If you don&rsquo;t know who your attacker is, you can&rsquo;t retaliate, even if you have offensive capabilities. If you have a nuclear bomb, the other person is not going to bomb you because you can retaliate. This Cold War logic doesn&rsquo;t work with the internet. And anyone can destroy somebody else&rsquo;s offensive capability by building up their own defenses. Meaning that if you have security for yourself, and if you do security research, and you find vulnerabilities, then you can basically destroy the offensive capabilities of others — because they rely on these vulnerabilities. You don&rsquo;t know if I have a nuclear bomb, and just because you build some protection doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t have a nuclear bomb. But if I have an exploit to which there are no fixes yet, and you close that gap, then I don&rsquo;t have a bomb anymore, I don&rsquo;t have a weapon anymore. Basically, you can take away somebody else&rsquo;s offensive capability by building good defenses. I think these dynamics have not been fully understood yet by policymakers.

I also believe that security could move away from being state-centric. My vision for cyberpeace is involving everyone in a certain union — and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a contractual union — which works towards building collective defenses. In other words, a global norm for &ldquo;zero day&rdquo; reporting in which countries report on these &ldquo;zero days.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll not only improve their own security, but also the security of everyone else. To many, this might sound too idealistic. But I don&rsquo;t think it is. I think there are very pragmatic reasons to do so. If you&rsquo;re part of this defensive union, then you will be much safer than if you&rsquo;re not.

Generally, I would apply Kant&rsquo;s vision that, in the end, we want to live on a peaceful planet or in a peaceful cyberspace. Hopefully, the whole internet will be a safe space, but we can start by creating smaller safe spaces. There will always be cyber attacks. But we can minimize the impact and increase the integrity of everybody&rsquo;s experience on the internet

A global norm for &ldquo;zero day&rdquo; reporting encourages everyone to contribute to everyone&rsquo;s security: you can&rsquo;t close the vulnerability for yourself only, you&rsquo;ll do it for everyone. At the same time, the only &ldquo;them&rdquo; are those who don&rsquo;t want to work together to make everyone&rsquo;s experience safer, which is basically the people that want to keep the exploits to themselves.

I do not have a very clear institutional setup of anon1138917760 this would work, because obviously, it&rsquo;s very difficult to control it. But my point is more on shifting the narrative from a place where a lot of war is happening — cyber war — to a place where cyber peace is possible, and where we should make sense of peace.

It&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s responsibility to make this shift happen, but I think institutions such as the European Union are well equipped for it. The US&rsquo;s current administration, — which obviously controls the most powerful capability — is not going to be willing right now. But, I hope that this could change given history&rsquo;s trajectory. We didn&rsquo;t think it would be possible to start a counter proliferation movement in the nuclear age, but we now actually live in a world with less bombs than 50 years ago. I know with the internet it&rsquo;s a long shot as well, and it isn&rsquo;t going to happen overnight. All the talks at the UN level are basically non-existent on this topic. But I really do hope that we could live in a world where we have less, not more, attacks and more integrity of everybody&rsquo;s devices.

## On AI and Ethics

When I started focusing on the narrative shift in cyber peace, I realized that besides being state centric, there were also several practical problems with it. And so I wanted something more positive than that. And that&rsquo;s when I got more interested in AI, as I believe it offers an opportunity to positively shape human thriving in many ways. To unlock this potential, we need to avoid its many risks, which are often discussed and which are very real.

Someanon1138917760, every utopia involving machines which can do more than we do, always ends up being a dystopia. This means we still have to do a lot of work on which utopia we actually want out there.

As I&rsquo;m a pragmatic idealist, my ideals are also based on my pragmatism. This means I don&rsquo;t believe in a world where we get rid of AI. Let&rsquo;s take as an example the unabomber, who bombed scientists, because he believed that the progress of science and technology would destroy human society. And given that I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a viable path — living with less technology — then the question arises: anon1138917760 can we shape the current trends and the current technologies that are benefiting humans instead? And anon1138917760 can we consciously decide not to use them?

But, overall, I&rsquo;m convinced that we will be able to create machines which will be better at performing certain tasks than humans are. Given that&rsquo;s going to come, the question is: anon1138917760 do we want to do that? The biggest problem is related to human centrism. So, anon1138917760 can we ensure that the tech aligns with our values?

When we look at AI governance questions — such as the one pioneered by Nick Bostrom: what do we do when general AI outsmarts humans? — they are extremely valuable questions to research. But we shouldn&rsquo;t forget the short term questions. For example, if we have a system making legal decisions in a public administration, what laws do we want to be imbued into that? Do we want some sort of human mandate, or democratically elected institutions, or do we want this to be done by an AI? In addition, do the outputs — in the material sense — have to be fair if it&rsquo;s cheaper and faster? Do we just accept that? Or, do we want to also be able to actually understand the process to be accessible for humans? This is crucial, as many advanced machine learning programs are currently black boxes to us, we can&rsquo;t really understand them.

The other question revolves around the idea that if it&rsquo;s trained on human data, human centric data, then it&rsquo;s going to take human vices with it. Even more so, it could aggregate and exaggerate them.

There&rsquo;s a lot of open questions, and I don&rsquo;t really have all the answers of course. My utopia is anon2298377336 abstract right now, because there&rsquo;s a lot of research and thinking and testing and acting to be done in this field. What we should focus on right now is to reap its benefits and avoid the risks: to ensure that we humanize the technology that we live with, in the sense that we really challenge what it means to be human ourselves. And right now, we don&rsquo;t. If we first figure out what it means to be human, then we can also tell anon1138917760 we want technology to help us to thrive."

To really follow the process you have to follow the updates on ledger.eu for although I am part of dyne.org (rob@anon

As you ask my opinion I'd say that it is the work in DECODE in which a provable computing environment is being developed on natural language smart contracts that is a guiding scheme, without of course enforcing this on the participants. Zenroom  provides the cryptography and the sensitive data manipulation for the whole Decode project, implementing the Coconut credential scheme developed by UCL in 2018.

Validation of the approach commercially is provided by the aqui-hire of Facebook of the UCL team to build LIBRA. ""In the absence of any detail on what might comprise a decentralized identity standard from Libra’s perspective, some dots can be joined by examining the recent work of George Danezis and his co-founders at Chainspace, a startup acquired by Facebook in May.""  Recently Microsoft announced their variation on a Coconut credential scheme.

Accountability over anonymity characterizes this approach as it underlies society in the 20th century itself. Tokenized trust is a key feature but only in the actual locality where face to face and communities of people work and live together.

Hi, Edgeryders community! As a linguistic anthropologist working with newly arrived migrants and refugees in Germany, I have heard a lot from my informants about the ways in which their internet use and needs have changed since leaving their countries of origin. 
Many struggled to find sufficient wifi connectivity en route in order to e.g. access navigation apps and services, stay in contact with friends and family members and contact emergency services. Others reported that they did not have sufficient access to legal information (particularly in their first language). Many rely heavily on translation apps which are often not adequate or do not translate from/into their first language. 

These are just a few examples of internet-based issues facing current migrants and refugees. What can be done to improve internet-based services, platforms, apps, access to advocacy groups and activists and support forums?  How can we think about the private/public divide in this context: anon1138917760 do we ensure quick access, user anonymity and safe networks? What are the responsibilities of content providers? How can individuals ensure that their data is protected?

What is currently being done to make internet-based services better for migrants and refugees and what needs to be done?"

I know very anon2726675500 about this specific area, but am interested to hear what other have to say. Many of my research informants discussed their changing internet-based habits/needs following their migration experiences. Priorities lay in fast, cheap/free communication platforms (e.g. WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, Signal, etc), translation software, navigation apps, money transfer sites, access to legal information, access to support networks, advocates and activists.

I&rsquo;ve been working on gender-based violence response for a anon2726675500 over a decade now, and have been focussing on issues of trust and gender, sexual politics, and anon1138917760 the role of emerging technologies in that. I want to facilitate meaningful connections between stakeholders, anticipate emergent harms, and ensure these conversations center on survivors and practitioners.

My personal trajectory into this research topic goes way back. I owe much of my gender consciousness to growing up in a bilingual and bicultural household as a Korean American immigrant. My family moved to the US from South Korea when I was 11-years-old, and it exposed me to two different systems of gender. Through that, I was able to develop my own kind of consciousness about anon1138917760 both gender and culture are not fixed.

In college, I became involved with the campus sexual assault/Title IX movement, organizing it on my own campus. And I spent about six months essentially doing a qualitative research by talking to different student groups to figure out what happens when a student experiences sexual assault and the extent to which the university does or doesn&rsquo;t take responsibility and provide resources for that. This coincided with a national movement which led to the [Obama administration's policy reform in 2014](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/22/memorandum-establishing-white-house-task-force-protect-students-sexual-a). 

Much of the national organizing relied heavily on social media, specifically Facebook groups to build coalition and share best practices. This happened to coincide with growing cultural awareness of social media as a potential tool for movement and community building. The downside of that that none of us really anticipated going in was cyberharassment. It was in the early days of[ Gamergate](https://gawker.com/what-is-gamergate-and-why-an-explainer-for-non-geeks-1642909080). And that is what made me interested in the role of technology: its double-edged role in facilitating connections but also targeted harassment. Fast forward to five years, and I&rsquo;m doing a research project on the role of technology in sexual misconduct reporting.

And that has been my path ever since, looking at the ways in which we can be imaginative in thinking about bodily auanon3386180186omy, care, and intimacy; anon1138917760 to translate that to political solidarity; and anon1138917760 that can be operationalized into actionable policy to hold institutions accountable; and the role of new technologies in that process.

**Lessons from anti-rape organizing and cyberharassment**

When I started organizing against campus sexual violence, it required me to spend a lot of time online to research, draft guidelines, connect with organizers in other campuses and organizations, etc. Almost immediately, I realized there were many communities of misogynist men who would actively track the discourse on sexual violence, and then directlytarget young activists who became national figureheads. They&rsquo;d constantly barrage us, saying we were liars, or that we didn&rsquo;t know what we were talking about.

It was deeply unsettling. I distinctly remember trying to report some cyberharassment I received. It felt different from other forms of harassment I had experienced before.. I would open my phone or my laptop, and the red notification butanon3386180186 would just glare at me. Because it was anonymous and online, it felt like I was constantly being watched. I felt completely at a loss as to anon1138917760 to even respond to it. I decided to report to the campus police and I remember being told it was my fault for having online accounts online, &ldquo;Oh, you wrote something online? Well, we can&rsquo;t really do anything.&rdquo;

I knew that this was the common response to cyberharassment, let alone non-tech facilitated harassment. Victims are always told that they should watch out, they should be more vigilant and judicious. I knew nothing would be done so I dropped my report. I know that there are some resources available today, but they remain individualized defensive strategies. We need to listen to the victims and activists of cyberharassment and tech-facilitated abuse to fundamentally change anon1138917760 we conceptualize these issues. It&rsquo;s built into the design of the Internet we have today, and until we change the platforms, it&rsquo;s only gonna get worse.

It&rsquo;s been about six or seven years since we&rsquo;ve first started organizing on different campuses across the US. We formed a network that&rsquo;s now become a nonprofit organization called [Know Your IX](https://www.knowyourix.org/). It started with a handful of us and it&rsquo;s been incredible to see this network of college students grow into a leading organization of young people combatting gender-based violence. Some are lawyers now, some are academics, and some are no longer in the space. Burning out is a real deterrent in this space, unfortunately. We lose our most vocal and critical people because we don&rsquo;t have the structure in place for them to reflect and grow. And all this while battling PTSD and other mental health challenges, and as the cyberharassment keeps clogging your inbox.

We know that this kind of environment has a chilling effect on who decides to speak where. Research sanon1138917760s again and again that women, especially women of color, tend to self-censor. But I think the issue extends beyond cyberharassment and hate speech. Youth organizing increasingly requires public visibility. We are asking young people to put themselves out on the Internet to face a barrage of hateful speech in order to commodify themselves in the name of social justice. I know, for myself, I found the constant expectation of visibility extremely constraining and harmful. I made a conscious decision to shift to research because I find that level of scholarly distance to be a more meaningful way to converse with an audience I can challenge and trust. I realize that&rsquo;s an extremely privileged option, and I really hope that we move beyond the visibility-oriented model of organizing. It asks too much of our organizers with anon2726675500 or no safeguarding in place.

**Can tech design for survivors?**

My doctoral research takes an ethnographically-informed approach to interrogate anon1138917760 assumptions about sex, violence, and power are encoded into the design and implementation of data/AI-driven sexual misconduct reporting systems.

In the case of campus sexual assault in the US, there has been an influx of digital systems designed to facilitate disclosures, collect evidence, and automate reporting. These systems are attractive to institutions, because they seem to be an easy fix to a difficult problem: having an internal grievance procedure, making sure it&rsquo;s a fair process, etc. This is especially true right now in a politically charged environment with #metoo and the Trump administration. To victims, who have very reasonable considerations to distrust their institutions — maybe because of their prior experiences of not being heard, or because they feel isolated, or because they fear retaliation — these technologies are perceived to be objective and neutral third parties.

Unfortunately, there are flaws in anon1138917760 these systems are designed and anon1138917760 they&rsquo;re applied. They are designed by humans. This means biases are encoded into the design of the systems, especially about what sexual harassment or violence looks like, or what a real victim is. And when they&rsquo;re applied within a politically charged and socially laden environment, they of course have discriminatory, exclusionary and unjust implications.

I&rsquo;ve conducted three years of ethnographically informed interviews with system designers, web users, and with institutional adopters — both frontend and backend users. The recurring narrative is that because this is data- and automation-driven, it is objective, it&rsquo;s neutral, it&rsquo;s secure. It very much feeds into the collective imagination of technologies as non-human and therefore, trustworthy. Interestingly, there&rsquo;s actually some behavioral science suggesting that because of this perception, victims are more likely to disclose earlier on and seek help earlier on, when they&rsquo;re talking to a digital interface rather than a human.

Part of it stems from the erosion of trust in traditional institutions and law enforcement, especially when it comes to sexual violence. Especially in the #metoo era, a lot of people, especially women, especially women of color, have very legitimate reasons to doubt that their institutions have their backs. And that&rsquo;s especially a serious issue when it comes to sexual violence, because the two most important factors in a survivors decision to report are:

* you need to be able to name what you experienced as a wrong. A lot of survivors don&rsquo;t, because they think their experience wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;real&rsquo; or &lsquo;bad&rsquo; enough.
* you need to believe that you will be believed when you do decide to disclose. Many, especially those from communities with historically charged relationship with law enforcement, don&rsquo;t.

People harbor serious distrust in their institutions and for good reasons. Tech positions itself as the solution to this problem of institutional distrust. Big Tech has successfully presented itself as the reliable and ideal alternative to the failures of traditional institutions. Because many people harbor reasonable distrust towards traditional institutions and don&rsquo;t necessarily understand tech systems, Big Tech can be really appealing. I&rsquo;ve really struggled with this aspect, which comes up in my fieldwork over and over again. When you have been dismissed, interrogated, and vilified by traditional institutions of law enforcement all your life, why would you want to turn to them in your moment of need? Without alleviating these institutions from their history of inequality and injustice, what does meaningfully distinguish them from Big Tech is that they are, by design, accountable to public interest. The same can&rsquo;t be said for Big Tech.

So, then, anon1138917760 do these systems fail to work? Consider anon1138917760 these reporting tools categorize sexual violence. In general, the reporting interface will ask few descriptive questions about who, when, where and an open response form asking &lsquo;describe what happened.&rsquo; Around this point, forms generally provide the option for the user to select a category of sexual misconduct that applies to them. It may appear as a drop-down menu or checkboxes. Some may enable you to select more than one option, say, &lsquo;racial profiling&rsquo; and &lsquo;sexual harassment.&rsquo; Some may only allow for one category. Some may not even have a category that applies to you. This is often the case with experiences of non-physical/sexual violence, like stalking and partner abuse. This means that, if your experience of sexual harassment is different from system designer&rsquo;s understanding of sexual harassment, you may not even be able to input your experience. This bias actively leaves out certain people&rsquo;s experiences, because its designers are working with a very particular narrative of anon1138917760 they understand what violence is.

So, then, what actually could be a useful use of tech? There have been a few interesting efforts of trying to create apps or automated system, for people to collect evidence pertaining to tech facilitated harassment in a way that that would be legally admissible. But for those the victim would still have to go through three years of chat history with their abuser. Instead, let&rsquo;s figure out a method to automate that process. Not only is it a traumatizing experience, but also a lot of victims don&rsquo;t have the data literacy to be able to doso. When I was working at a domestic violence clinic in Los Angeles, for example, most of our clients were single, undocumented mothers who didn&rsquo;t speak English, with very low tech literacy. But they would bring screen grabs, they would have to sit through and waded through years of stuff, and they get extremely overwhelmed by tech, and for good reasons. Of course, that&rsquo;s something that tech could actually make easier.

**A case against reporting**

Part of the problem with the design and implementation of these reporting systems is that there is such a fixation on reporting. Data on sexual violence tends to privilege and reinforce reporting as the ideal outcome for survivors. The methodological reason is that data on sexual violence is very difficult to collect, as it relies on self-disclosure and poses ethical challenges, so researchers and policymakers look to reporting data. The social reason is that we see reporting as an active outcome and dismiss others as less legitimate.

But help-seeking is an extremely iterative and continuing process. It takes victims usually six months to 11 months to even disclose it to anybody, before formally reporting it. And formal reporting is also not necessarily the best outcome for a lot of people: you might share kids with your assailant, you might be worried about their immigration status, or you might just want them to face consequences that don&rsquo;t involve them going away to jail. Thinking about help-seeking and thinking about recovery is often done in a very narrow way: &ldquo;have you reported that?&rdquo; &ldquo;go to the police&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;ll get better.

This attitude gets encoded into the design of reporting systems. Constant notifications and nudges are baked into the flow of the interface to incentivize the user to consider formal reporting. The system vendors seem to think that automated and data-driven tools will point the user to one optimal solution--reporting.

But this is incredibly misguided. Survivors are not a monolithic group: their experiences of violence, access to resources, recovery process, and ideas of justice are extremely diverse. And this multiplicity should be appreciated, because it gives the society a more robust and relational way of thinking about justice. But the way that reporting tools are designed does not allow for this.

In addition, a lot of these systems are technically for everyone, but they&rsquo;re usually only adopted by, and used for, privileged and tech savvy English speaking users. For example, workplace harassment system tools are for everybody, which should include anitorial workers, temp workers, contract workers. But they are written out of these systems because they are rarely identified as a potential user or their employment contracts subject them to a different grievance procedure.

**Doing more with &lsquo;small data&rsquo;**

In my research, I make a case for de-emphasizing reporting. This posed a methodological challenge in conducting my research. How do I gather data about survivors&rsquo; help-seeking experience without relying on reporting data? As I said, we already know that the data we have tends to privilege people who were successful in going through the legal system to report their incidents. This means that victim demographic information and the incidents, assault information, and legal recourse are already extremely partial. The reporting tools I study build their systems based on that data. The data we use reinforce the privileging of reporting as the ideal outcome for survivors. What would it mean for me, then, as a researcher to rely on reporting data?

This is why I turned to qualitative research and '[small data.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878)'Having a structured conversation with all the different people involved in the design and application process provides better data about reporting systems&rsquo; impact and implications. It might take me several emails, many referrals, and several weeks of relationship building, but the conversations I have with each participant is so rich and insightful and telling, much more than what I could get if I were to do a survey or something.

**De-glammorize tech**

Even after discussing anon1138917760 and why tech solutions to sexual misconduct reporting fails us, the question I often get is: anon1138917760 can we improve the tech we have so that their &lsquo;failures&rsquo; and &lsquo;shortcomings&rsquo; can be overcome? To me, this belief that tech can be improved to perfection to the point of replacing human actors is so fundamentally misguided.

At the end of the day, these reporting tools are essentially case management systems. The vendors market themselves as a revolutionary innovation to &lsquo;combat seuxal violence&rsquo; and &lsquo;empower survivors.&rsquo; But combating violence and supporting survivors comes from sustained collective action. No new system can or will be able to do that.

Rather than asking anon1138917760 tech can be fixed for the better, the more urgent and important question is: who and what are we overlooking when we turn to tech solutions? Social workers, administrators, advocates and activists, and scholars spend years becoming experts in violence prevention and response so that they can serve survivors better. How much money, time, and energy are not going to them, when we spend those resources on tech? These are the people who work directly with victims and are in the best position to inform policies and practices. We should trust what they have to say, because they have experience and have demonstrated that they have the public&rsquo;s interest. The same can&rsquo;t be said for tech solutions.

The shiny new tech can seem like it can offer accuracy and objectivity. But they can&rsquo;t because they are built by people based on data collected by people. From design to implementation, every point is inculcated with bias. This is not to say that there is no place for data-driven tools. But when we de-glam tech, we can see it for what it is--it&rsquo;s a tool to help us connect, communicate, and make informed decisions. This is why we need to support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over anon1138917760 they interpret and act on data.

**Burning question:** How can we support practitioners in anti-violence space, like social workers, jurors and judges, and advocates, with data and tech literacy, so that they have control over anon1138917760 they interpret and act on data?

The first is that the Internet's architecture facilitates collective action. This is true for the good action of the anti-harassment activists, but also for the bad action of cyberharassers:

 

[quote=""anon2474722476, post:1, topic:11193""]
I realized there were many communities of misogynist men who would actively track the discourse on sexual violence, and then directlytarget young activists who became national figureheads. They’d constantly barrage us, saying we were liars, or that we didn’t know what we were talking about. [...] **It’s built into the design of the Internet we have today, and until we change the platforms, it’s only gonna get worse**.
[/quote]

The second thread is one I am more familiar with: understanding data. Like all data, reporting data are not a a faithful reconstruction of the phenomenon underpinning them (harassment), but just one, very partial, proxy for that phenomenon. And, like all data, they carry the risk of shifting all the attention onto the proxy, and away from the thing itself. We make what we measure, and if we measure reporting, we will end up acting only on what is being reported. 

Both these threads, I believe, are relevant to a discussion on a new Internet of humans. 

For the first one, I have a curiosity: anon1138917760 did people in the anti-harassment movement, like yourself, respond to the discovery that the Internet was both empowering them *and* putting them under pressure? Were people calling for more policing of the Internet? Or dreaming to go all crypto, and take solace in anonymity? Or what? 

For the second one, what I read in your post is a promising effect and a warning. The promising effect is that, it I understand correctly, people are more likely to report harassment episodes if they do it online. But even here, anon1138917760 can we be sure that the increased likelihood is not a function of the credibility of the follow-up downstream of reporting? After  all, you yourself point out that many people are mistrustful of institutions; a highly structured Internet funnel might offer some more guarantees, as caseloads and queues of people processing reports are monitored. If a report lands in your inbox, and is not processed in a reasonably short time, you will surely hear from your manager!

And the warning is, of course, that what you are looking at here is not reporting of harassment, but harassment itself. And plenty of it happens even in the absence of reporting: we ned to make sure we do not lose track of that. 

Am I reading your correctly? What are your thoughts on my questions?"

You probably know these cases, but since some others in this thread seemed interested also in related/relevant/analogous examples from (kind of, at least structurally) adjacent areas including IoT and AI, here are a few that might be interesting in the sense that I hope they complement your argument:

* At our most recent annual ThingsCon conference (2018), Manon den Dunnen shared her experience of reporting gone bad through unintented consequences when police officers would exchange phone numbers with both victims of crimes as well as suspects, and the Facebook apps would often do its network matching/contact proposal thing and *directly propose to connect victim and suspect/perpetrator*. It's anon2298377336 horrific, and a super important case study about data minimization and network mining (it's also a short video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6MRVQG8Vh0
* A number of studies have sanon1138917760n algorithmic bias at its worst where policing and/or justice related algorithms were trained on training sets that had massively racist data points, including statistics created based on policing behavior that was deemed illegal/racist by courts at the time, but someanon1138917760 remained part of the data sets. (AI Now Institute has mentioned this multiple times across their annual AI Now reports.)
* NYC's policing algorithm (in)famously measures effectiveness by fairly simply metrics like numbers of arrests and severity of the causes of arrests. This has created horrific incentives for police to report highly selectively so as not to ruin their (perceived) performance, including going so far as to structurally intimidate rape victims to change their charges from rape to minor offenses. The podcast [Reply All had a mini series](https://gimletmedia.com/sanon1138917760s/reply-all/o2hx34) on it that's very accessible.

Those just came to mind and maybe they're helpful for some of the people reading here. And I couldn't agree more with your conclusion that tech won't be the solution to a complex social issue such as this.

**This post will try to provide a bit of an overview of some of the main ongoing current discussions as well as to communicate some of the feedback, findings and suggestions from our Ethnography Team.**

First to introduce the role of the Ethnography Team here at Edgeryders:

It is hard to put into a short description what Edgeryders is doing for and with you and the world, because it is and can be so many things, which is one of the reasons why we are discussing this very thing in a kind of &ldquo;meta-discussion&rdquo; with you here: 

https://edgeryders.eu/t/why-to-edgeryder/10385

If you can give us your take on &ldquo;why to edgeryder, that would be great!

**However, one of the key things we are doing is Semantic Social Network Analysis** (SSNA), [see video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_DoEa3lcBE&amp;feature=youtu.be), which means that a team of ethnographers and coder read all the discussions here on the platform, analyse them, identify topics and use an algorithm to identify connections and patterns in discussions which we can use to research anon1138917760 to improve our communication, but also to find new venues for the discussions themselves.

These network analysis put into graphics look for example like this:

This one is from the preliminary results report of the current NGI conversations @anon942358443 [just posted here](https://edgeryders.eu/t/ngi-ethnography-preliminary-results-for-community-members/11325?u=anon942358443).

_**She raises two very interesting points in that report:**_


**1. We need to try to define the term &ldquo;DEEP GREEN TECH&rdquo; with some concrete examples, with terms that do not require absolute expertise in specific fields to enable proper cross discipline discussion and face the issue of anon1138917760 to deal with the underlying tension between acknowledging the ecological costs of the tech industry and findings ways to develop technological tools to protect the climate.**

[quote=&quot;anon942358443, post:1, topic:11325&quot;]

Several current threads revolve around the notion of Deep Green Tech. While there is a lot of interesting discussion around this concept, it has yet to be clearly defined by the community. From what we can gather so far, Deep Green Tech is similar to Deep Tech, describing mainly startup companies based on substantial scientific research and innovations in tech engineering. Deep Green Tech, broadly, seems to describe technology that is ecologically sustainable, innovative and based on scientific advancements. The concept of Deep Green Tech appears to be a central area of focus for the NGI Forward community, but there seems to be ongoing discussions to clarify confusion around the term&rsquo;s definition, its ramifications and implications. As a result, we want to help cut through the opacity of these discussions by working with you to understand anon1138917760 you define the term while also asking you to give concrete examples of its application, e.g. in design, research, tech innovation etc. In this way, we think we might all move toward a deeper and more productive discussion of the futures we want to see.

[/quote]

[quote=&quot;anon942358443, post:1, topic:11325&quot;]

Interestingly (and perhaps conversely), explorations of the relationship between the climate and the internet/tech appears to be in its infancy, and though we are working with a community of experts, there often seems to be a struggle to solidly define key terms and concepts. Despite expertise, or perhaps because of it, specificity in defining technologies and technological areas requiring increased research focus persists across stories, meaning that you might find defining targeted and specific problems around these areas difficult as well. Also of interest, many of you find an underlying tension between acknowledging the ecological costs of the tech industry and findings ways to develop technological tools to protect the climate.

[/quote]

**2. We need to include more of our personal experience, motivations and examples in our stories, thoughts, ideas and project presentations and discussions. Your views on the topic are surely interesting, but knowing what brought you to start thinking about it and what shaped your ideas is what will enable us to not only connect but also to discuss and research on a deeper level!**

If we can find such parallels on the Internet (rather than &lsquo;what does the future look like to you&rsquo;?), instead of &lsquo;tell us about the last time something online upset you, and why?&rsquo; (or other questions along those lines, around sustainability for example) we might all get a deeper understanding.

**_Therefore, do not just tell us about your great idea, project or view on the Internet, but also tell us about the situation that first made you think about this and concrete examples that make it relevant to you personally :)!_**

**Short Term Scientific Missions – Call 2/2019-20**

**COST Action - “From Sharing To Caring: Examining Socio-Technical Aspects of the Collaborative Economy""**

**Deadline: November 25th 2019, (Midnight, Brussels Time) for proposed STSM to take place before the 30th of April 2020**

http://sharingandcaring.eu/grant/short-term-scientific-mission-stsm-grants

**STSM Committee**

Prof. Luigina Ciolfi (Chair)

Prof. Sergio Nasarre-Aznar

Dr. Vasilis Kostakis

 

**What Are STSMs?**

 

Short Term Scientific Missions (STSMs) are exchange visits aimed at supporting researchers’ individual mobility, strengthening existing networks and fostering collaboration. STSMs are intended especially, but not solely, for young researchers.

 

An STSM should specifically contribute to the scientific objectives of the COST Action “Sharing And Caring”, while enabling those partaking in the missions to establish new partnerships, learn new techniques, gain access to specific data, instruments and / or methods not available in their own institutions / organisations.

 

**Who can apply?**

 

STSMs are open for PhDs, PostDocs, and advanced career researchers employed at institutions in countries participating in “Sharing AndCaring”, or at approved institutions. STSMs must be performed between COST countries - researchers cannot apply for an STSM within their own country.

 

Priority will be given to Early Career Investigators (ECI) (maximum 8 years since obtaining their PhD at the time of application) and PhD students working on socio-technical aspects of the collaborative economy.

 

Particular consideration will also be given to candidates moving from/to COST Inclusiveness Target Countries (ITCs), which include Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Esanon3386180186ia, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Republic of Serbia and Turkey.

 

International COST participants may host STSM researchers from European COST countries but may not apply for STSMs themselves.

 

Awards throughout the annual grant period (for the third year: 1st May 2019- 30th April 2020) will be made to support scientific excellence, and to support a variety of researchers in terms of gender, career stage, affiliation, and nationality.

 

**What can you apply for?**

 

You can apply for a short term scientific mission of the duration between 5 and 90 days (and up to 180 days if the applicant is an ECI) to take place before April 30th 2020. The STSM will be a fixed grant to cover part of the travel expenses and living allowance. The cost of research materials is not eligible for consideration as part of the grant.

 

Please note that the awarded grant will be paid only after the STSM has been completed – therefore the applicant must have approval and prior financial support e.g., from their own institution.

The following funding conditions apply and must be respected:

●      up to a max of EUR2500 in total can be afforded to each successful STSM applicant;

●      up to a max of EUR160 per day can be afforded for accommodation &amp; meal expenses;

●      for ECIs, a max amount of EUR3500 can be afforded to the Grantee for STSMs with a duration of between 91 &amp; 180 days – For ECIs partaking in STSMs with a duration of between 5 &amp; 90 days, the limit is EUR2500; STSM activities must occur in their entirety within the dates specified in this call.

STSM awards may be combined with other funding sources, but these must be acknowledged in the application.

In your application, you will have to describe the goal of the proposed STSM, anon1138917760 it contributes to the scientific remit of the COST Action “Sharing And Caring”, the planned expenses and the outputs planned as result of the STSM. For ECIs, two support letters by advanced career researchers will be required.

For detailed rules regarding eligibility and financial support, please see the relevant sections of the COST Vademecum ([ *http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum* ](http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum) *)* .

**When can you apply?**

You can apply until Midnight (Brussels Time) on the 25th of November 2019.

  

**How can you apply?**

 

This is a step-by-step guide to applying for an STSM and the criteria by which STSM applications will be assessed. More in-depth information can be found at the COST Vademecum ([ *http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum* ](http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum) *)* . Please contact Prof Luigina Ciolfi (STSM coordinator) ([l.ciolfi@anon

 

The application process is as follows:

1. Applicants must carefully read the funding rules detailed in Section 7 of the  *COST*  H2020  *Vademecum, Section 7 (* [ *http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum* ](http://www.cost.eu/download/COSTVademecum) *)*

2. Applicants must submit an application using e-COST https://e-services.cost.eu/user/login/STSM. If you do not already have an e-COST account you will first need to 'create an account' - which will include providing the details of the bank account where the grant will be lodged if your STSM application is approved and the STSM successfully completed.

3. Applicants must obtain a letter of invitation from the Host Institution confirming that they can undertake the STSM on the given dates should their application be approved.

4. Applicants must complete, submit and download their STSM application online at: https://e-services.cost.eu/stsm.

5. Applicants also  **must**  send their application form and the relevant supporting documents for evaluation by email directly to Prof. Luigina Ciolfi ([l.ciolfi@anon

The list of supporting documents to be submitted for the evaluation are:

●      Letter of invitation to the applicant from a senior Researcher at the Host institution.

●      The submitted STSM application form (downloadable when the online application is submitted - see 4 above).

●      A letter including an overview of the proposed activities that will be performed, a workplan for the visit, a description of the proposed contributions to the scientific objectives of the “SharingAndCaring” Action, an outline of the host's scientific expertise/resources in support of the STSM. The letter should be  *maximum 8 pages, the font should correspond to Times New Roman size 12 pt with single line spacing and standard margins of 2 cm.*

●      A letter of support from the Applicant’s Home Institution.

●      A Full C.V. (including a list of academic publications – if applicable).

 

6. The “Sharing And Caring” STSM panel organises assessment of the STSM proposal: STSM selection team assess the proposal (see ‘STSM Selection Criteria’) – may seek expert but impartial advice to inform their decision. If approved, the STSM coordinator sends application and approval to Grant Holder &amp; Action Chair for final check.

7. The Grant Holder sends the applicant a grant letter to sign and return. The STSM should not be started until this letter has been signed and returned.

8. After the STSM, the investigator submits a scientific report to the STSM Host and STSM coordinator within 30 days of completing the STSM. This must include: the purpose of the mission; description of work carried out; description of main results/outputs; plan of future collaborations with Host (if applicable); planned publications resulting from STSM (if applicable); confirmation of successful STSM by Host.

9. STSM Coordinator and Action Chair approve the final report. The Grant Holder executes payment to STSM Applicant.

 

**Criteria for Awarding STSM**

 

STSM funding will be awarded according to the COST key principles of:

●      Excellence

●      Inclusivity

●      Balance

 

Criteria for evaluation will be as follows:

 

●      The relevance and application of the research to the field of the Action – a detailed work plan will help determine if the scientific aims of the work will be relevant and applicable to the Action’s aims (1-5 points).

●      The quality and clarity of the proposed research - The STSM application should be of high quality, arguing clearly and cogently the importance and timeliness of the research (1-5 points).

●      The choice of Host institution – the applicant must give specific scientific reasons for visiting their chosen Host institution. We will also be tracking the geographical distribution of the Host institutions to ensure there is an evenly-spread network for knowledge transfer. Involvement of ITC countries will be a plus (1-5 points).

●      The home institution of the researcher – We will take into account the number of applications from each institution to ensure a fair spread of researches across the network. Involvement of ITC countries will be a plus (1-5 points)

●      The profile of the researcher – We will take into account the researcher’s potential of successfully completing the STSM on the basis of their previous work and achievements commensurate to their career stage. In line with COST policy, we will preferentially award STSMs to early career investigators (PhD + &lt;8 years). This should not discourage more experienced researchers from applying (1-5 points).

●      For ECIs, the support provided by senior colleagues

●      The publication/output potential of the research carried out – Based on the STSM work plan and detailed publication/output plan (1-5 points)."

Healthcare and Genetic data records are amongst the most intimate of data. I am seeing a frightening trend of people using services like 23&me which not only compromises their own privacy, but that of everyone who can be identified as members of their family. I can see a wide range of scenarios where this can prove problematic e.g where healthcare is privatised and insurance get a hold of data which can allow them to deny you coverage due to pre-existing conditions or genetic predisposition. Also, public institutions cannot be relied on to safeguard that data as they may be tempted to sell them to third parties that profess to helping them save costs through more efficient management of resources, triaging etc.

Thought this might be a good place to get some eyeballs on it before it is released :slight_smile:, and generally this group might be interested in the subject of anon1138917760 we can build a more open, innovative and user-centric internet. 

Thanks for sharing your perspective!

------
We all have heard it: In order to build something valuable you it has to be 10X better than whats there. It seems like an accepted law of entrepreneurship.

A law so strong that not even Google+, with Billions of backing, could not become a rival to Facebook. Google+ arguably had some features that made it a better service than Facebook.

**This begs the questions if the reasons the 10x law exist actively prevents innovation from happening, why this 'law' exists in the first place and what we can do to change the rules?**

## Everyone knows the pain of trying out new products

Common knowledge suggest services need to be 10x better because in order for users to really bother trying a new product it just needs to be a lot better. I think that's not the case and the key to solving this question lies in the phrase **""to try a new product"".** 

**I believe the real reason are are the switching costs, lock-ins and network effects that make it very hard or impossible to leave services and try out something new.** 

Imagine you wanted to move from Facebook to Google+, Akasha or Mastadon. All your posts and messages ported over is impossible and you immediately lose access to all of the friends you have on Facebook.

So as long as the following is true people tendenciously do not switch other services, even if they know those are better.

    Costs to switch (time & mental effort) > Additional benefit offered * ~10

## But....what about innovation?

Don't these 10x requirements produce the leapfrogs in innovation we need to solve humanities biggest challenges quickly?

![tenor|444x250](upload://oTgVgQCQJIebqk2D7N916FbTI5Q.gif) 

**Yes because** it indeed produces big, measurable, jumps in innovation that have brought humanity forward. 

**But no because** 

1. The amount of effort, money to build new (but structurally similar) services where 9/10 companies will fail because others dominating the market is a gigantic waste of human potential and time. We don't have the time to tinker on every new solution for years. We need to get it down to week(ends) or months.  ****
2. Sometimes already a new feature to an existing service would bring great innovation. For example I waited 4 years before Facebook implemented the ability to save posts for later reading. Simply thing. If I had been able to modify this feature in my own clients it would have offered great workflow innovation for me.
3. The necessity to have such big jumps also brought us insane growth requirements that are responsible for a lot of things that go wrong in this world in the first place, and which we need to fix now.

## Faster innovation through incremental gains

**How would a world look like where not 1/10 companies survive & produce 10x innovation, but 6/10 companies survive, each producing 2x innovation at 1/10 of the cost?** 

We would enter a world where we create incremental innovations at higher speed and less effort, more employment, more stable companies and economy, more service competition and less exploitation. 

![com-optimize%20(2)|451x268](upload://lraYqtL2qVut74gWPrNffLeitCC.gif) 

## What's holding us back: Network Effects and Data Lock-Ins

### Cause #1: How we share success in companies: 
Speculative value increase

In order to reward the risk of contributing to a company in either time or money we use equity or stages stocks. 

The problem is that in most cases shareholders make most (or all) of their profits if the speculative value of the company increases. The company's profits, revenue and user numbers are only proxies, success is not directly dependent on them. Growth is the key metric a company optimises for. 

Therefore the worst thing that can happen for shareholders is that growth is slow or negative. Losing users or revenue is not acceptable and lock-ins **must** be created. 

Facebook is arguably the king of network effects and also an example of anon1138917760 extreme the above dynamic has become:

**In the 2nd quarter of 2018, Facebook lost $120bn (billion!) in stock value within 48 hours, the biggest loss of any company in history. The reason: It posted** the least growth **since its founding, while still making 5BN in profits the same quarter and growing by 42% since the last year.** 

Think whatever you want about they way Facebook makes money, but such a highly profitable company should not be losing 20% of their stock value overnight while still being wildly profitable. 

### Cause #2: You and your data are hostages:
Data and Social Lock-ins & Non-Interoperable data formats

The requirement to grow incentivises companies to lock people into their services and make it very hard to leave. Either it's difficult to migrate and reuse your data in other services, or they create network effects where you lose your social connections if you leave a service.

This also creates counter incentives for interoperable formats which would make it easier to migrate between services or integrate them into custom workflows. 

Further, most businesses require to amass intellectual property in the form of proprietary software. There is an economic incentive to **not** share their progress with the world. 
This way every new service/competitor needs to start freshly, even for a simple app like a calendar app. 

# The 3 things that need to change

Breaking this dynamic requires tackling the problem from multiple angles. 
I think it needs 3 things to make that possible.  

1. **Data and social Interoperability** so users can freely move between services that suit their needs better and never lose the ability to communicate with their friends on other services. This will create the free-market pressure to produce good services, as you can't lock people in as easily anymore and only keep them if you are the best service to them.
2. **Economic models that reward being a good service, not growth.**
In an environment where people can easily leave a service, a company can only really be successful if they focus on being a good service. This way they will need to optimise for revenue, not growth. Further, their growth is limited to the amount of people they can be the best service for, so it will be hard to get growth-focused Venture Capital investments. Another economic model is needed where investors make money only if the company is being a good service, thus by making revenue and profits.
3. **Optional but ideal: Open-Source software** 
New companies should be able to build on each other's work to provide services faster without spending 1000s of hours in building up services from scratch. Increased collaboration on key infrastructure and drop in development costs are expected.

## A way forward?

At [WorldBrain.io](http://worldbrain.io) we are building open-source software and attempt to enable incremental innovation in the (knowledge management) software space. 

The foundation to make this possible is Memex, an open-source privacy focused tool to organise your online research. It's a mix of a Google Search for everything you have seen in the past, Medium's highlighting and commenting features but for the whole web, and Pocket's organisation features supercharged. All data is stored locally on your computer by default - you are in control. (You can download it here: [worldbrain.io](http://worldbrain.io))

This is anon1138917760 it help may tackle the problem: 

1. **We bake interoperability deep into the core of Memex.**
To make search possible Memex stores personal data from the different services you use (e.g. your browsing history/bookmarks/trails, social media posts and comments, what you shared/liked content on social media, your annotations and notes). 
Doing so in a way that creates unified data formats across multiple services. After all, social media posts on Twitter and Facebook are structurally not that different. 
To make this data usable for you we are in the process of developing an API that you, developers and entrepreneurs can use to innovate on new services or integrate with your existing ones. This central data store also houses your own social graph, so whichever service you eventually use, you can take your friends with you. 
2. **Everything we develop is open source.** 
Everyone has different workflows when managing knowledge and needs different tools. People can copy Memex, change features and reuse the data they had in their previous Memex via the Storex API, or use 2 Memex tools in parallel. This ensures that innovators do not have to start freshly every time they want to improve a service, but can create incremental gains, acquire users easily and eventually create innovation faster. 
3. **[WorldBrain.io](http://worldbrain.io) has no stock value. There is no speculation.**
To reward early contributions and risk, we use a non-speculative economic model called Steward Ownership. In practice it is a profit sharing model that has a cap on the returns investors and employees can make - the cap is higher the earlier you join. 
This ensures that everyone is focused on building a sustainable service and greed for more than you ought to get is removed. 
**It allows us as a company to be OK (its surely nothing to celebrate, but its OK) to lose users and revenue to other services as it will only delay investors' returns, not lower them.** 

## Next Steps:

Of course such a data infrastructure, and the resulting data sovereignty, brings a whole new class of (privacy) challenges with it - after all we wanna prevent that this can turn into a Cambridge Analytica 4.0 scenario because people unknowingly share detailed data about their digital life. 

We are currently forming a community of people to map out all those challenges and anon1138917760 to tackle them through e.g. good UX, education or privacy preserving technologies.

### Our open questions we want to address:

1. How do we create a secure technology infrastructure for personal data?
2. Data sovereignty & flexible APIs come with risks - Cambridge Analytica 4.0 style risks. How do we create good UX that makes it easy, transparent and flexible to share personal data with other applications, while educating users about the potential risks and opportunities.
3. What can we learn from past efforts to interoperability and data model standardisation in order to create interoperable data models/formats for knowledge sharing that can evolve with contemporary needs.
4. How does legislation need to change to support ecosystems that are built on privacy as well as data portability/interoperability and reduce social lock-ins?
5. How can (governmental) funding mechanisms be designed to support early stage entrepreneurs and organisations using Steward Ownership or Non-Profit models, so they can avoid Venture Capital and focus on generating sustainable revenue/profits.
6. How can we facilitate a multi-stakeholder community of individuals & organisations with potentially large spectrum of political, economical and technical motivations/requirements to use this data infrastructure. 
7. How can we create a community that is inclusive to people with different, sometimes opposing, world views and which lives constructive, consent-focused (not consensus!) discourse to ease those difference and find multi-partisan solutions.

**Do you have ideas on anon1138917760 to answer those questions, or know people who do?** 

**Get in touch with us and help designing systems that are user centric, interoperable and build with a strong focus on data sovereignty and privacy.**

This is a very good question and relates to something my friend @anon1733603565 once said when we were talking about entrepreneurship. I'm paraphrasing, but basically, the argument is that the start-up entrepreneurship hype is mostly a cheap way for big companies to outsource their R&D to young idealistic people who are willing to live on noodles and spend their best years chasing a project that is very likely to fail. And the systems are set up so that if they do make it, against the odds, they end up under investor control and are likely to be sold off to a bigger player for a pay-out. This 2x world is certainly more appealing in that regard.

The OP is really good as it explains why the economic ecosystem fails to select for growth in utility because of various impeding factors. 

I thought a bit about questions similar to Cause 1 and 2 last week and spoke about them with some friends. I think Cause 2 is a really hard nut to crack as it's impossible to have open APIs for personal data (as we learnt from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, mentioned by OP). To spur innovation and bust the tech oligopoly we'll need open standards, protocols, interoperability etc. The big problem here is that the oligopoly as well as their customers (advertisers) oppose such changes as that would undermine their profitable positions. 

I wonder anon1138917760 and if grassroot innovations alone can break the staleness of the oligopoly. It might take a bit of trust busting from USA and EU to really shake things up through political means. 

Right now there are a bunch of competitors to the oligopoly but they are irrelevant since most of them don't seem to realise the importance of working with the whole stack. Each of them have simply too anon2726675500 brainpower (since most good developers are already employed by the oligopoly) to be anywhere close to develop as good services as the oligopoly does which makes the strategy of competing with a better service a fool's errand. Bitchute will never be able to outcompete Youtube with a bit freer speech as their USP.

My idea last week was to develop some kind of virtual business card as a hub for metadata about a person or a company you want to follow and then build a platform to navigate these information streams. Different communications platforms can be connected to that hub. My idea at that point didn't even attempt to solve the problem of the storage of the databases. I doubt we can solve that issue for the forseeable future since only the major clouds have the scale to store the data cheap enough. Storing data locally is incompatible with the nature of social media since the communication is asynchronous. So far blockchains have been unimpressive in their ability of integrating social media or other services into the protocol itself to make data storage disembodied from a singular entity like a corporation. So far the only use case for blockchains is to tranfer money since then there's an acceptance for the high costs of transferring small amounts of data. 

I'm very happy to read that many of my ideas about some kind metadata manager had already been thought of and implemented by Worldbrain. I'm also a bit skeptic: Does Worldbrain want to compete in an existing market dynamic or do they want to disrupt the dynamics. It might be hard to achieve both goals of making things interoperable as well as spending time to develop a good UX. Wikipedia/Wikimedia have managed this but for such a shifting service such as managing information overload in an environment where the flows of information are locked into personalised propertiary algorithms on different platforms it might be a much harder task anon1138917760 to make the webs manageable. 

I'm currently opting out from a lot of different data managers and unfollowing topics on social media (like Pocket) and just shove the data into Excel instead where there's a simple 2D-layout that suits me better. This process of decluttering gives me a lot of inspiration. There are many things I learn about myself and of the internet through this process. Maybe we can remodel the stack, loosen the grip of the oligopoly and spur more innovation. What I desire is the somwhat oxymoronic desire of having many different information flows manageable through a small set of apps/sites/services. Facebook and RSS have failed me. Facebook because it's too closed and hard to configure and RSS becuase it doesn't have an algorithm to discern what's relevant or not."

I think no need to apologise for good insights :) Sometimes it is hard to condense these year long experiences and thoughts. So no problem. One purpose of such conversations is after all to synthesise. :slight_smile:

> I think Cause 2 is a really hard nut to crack as it’s impossible to have open APIs for personal data

I think I understand your concern and fear the Cambridge Analytica 2.0 scenario too, but I would not say it is impossible to solve. We think it is a **very** hard nut to crack though. The way to solve the data sharing problem is not just with technology but also with a lot of education. Such systems need to be very well designed in terms of UX and anon1138917760 to educate people about the way to share data without overwhelming them. That's a whole range of challenges by themselves. 

> To spur innovation and bust the tech oligopoly we’ll need open standards, protocols, interoperability etc.

YES! This is exactly what we think too. In order to have more data sovereignty, privacy and better services we think the best metric to optimise for is interoperability, not decentralisation. If we manage to do this, we assume we create the kind of free-market dynamics that could break up the power of those organisations. 

> It might take a bit of trust busting from USA and EU to really shake things up through political means.

I think luckily we have the regulatory atmosphere in Europe that is tendentiously more interested in privacy and interoperability, making Europe a very good foundational market for such an effort. 

> since most of them don’t seem to realise the importance of working with the whole stack.

Can you elaborate, not sure if I got this. Seems important to understand tho. 

> Different communications platforms can be connected to that hub.

This is one of the thinking processes on anon1138917760 this platform could be architected to avoid a vulnerable centralisation of user data in user's control. Basically finding a way that the data in all the services a user uses is accessible with a Memex, but stays in the ""protection"" of those services, spreading the attack surface. 
However to make this possible it would require those oligopolies to play ball to this, which is unlikely. So another route is to use some good ol' [adversarial interoperability](https://boingboing.net/2019/06/07/lightsabers-for-trustbusting.html) to create data formats that interoperate with those services and once such formats have more widespread use it may 'force' previously locked up services to open up more in order to stay competitive. This is a very long game though. 

> Storing data locally is incompatible with the nature of social media since the communication is asynchronous.

Indeed it is and a dogmatic approach to decentralisation will not get us very far. We think that there is always a necessity for varying degrees of (de)centralisation in the system, dependent on the use case. 
In our approach this means that we follow a wordpress.com/org style model where we provide hosting to users who want to have a SaaS experience, but you can self-host your sync/collaboration node too. 
As decentralised storage technologies like Dat or IPFS mature, it may be purpuseful to use them, but not now. 

>  So far blockchains have been unimpressive in their ability of integrating social media or other services into the protocol itself to make data storage disembodied from a singular entity like a corporation.

Actually I see a deep dichotomy in the goals that blockchain and cryptocurrencies in particular have that impede their ability to have the impact of decentralisation originally envisioned. 
On the one hand they use technology that tries to build trustless, distributed systems and on the other hand an economic model that intrinsically creates incentives for centralisation through the speculative nature of anon1138917760 success is shared. 

> Does Worldbrain want to compete in an existing market dynamic or do they want to disrupt the dynamics.

Which dynamics specifically are your referring to?
The current market dynamics I understand is the centralisation of user data around corporate entities and the network effects created. If that is what you are talking about, yes our plan is to disrupt that dynamic by giving users unprecedented freedom to move services, a freedom we believe is hard to take away again once given. The big assumption is therefore that over time it may force existing players to adopt such interoperability to stay competitive. 

Apart from that maybe that answers some of the question:
There are 2 different entities forming: 
1) WorldBrain.io as a company which is the developer of (the current) open-source Memex and generates revenue by providing SaaS services to users. 
2) Still to be named: Storex and a community of organisations/individuals as the underlying infrastructure which will be built as a non-profit, multi-partisan entity similar to wordpress.org. WorldBrain.io will likely be the main driver behind its development for the next 1-2 years but keeping it intentionally open and separated from the main business. 

>Facebook because it’s too closed and hard to configure and RSS becuase it doesn’t have an algorithm to discern what’s relevant or not.

We hope through this central store and the upcoming collaboration features that are based on a PubSub model we would combine the best of both worlds. You can have data streams coming in from your various sources and use whatever algorithm, UI or UX you prefer to manage those streams. 
This modularity is one of the key principles behind building Memex and Storex.

Yes :) that is the idea. If we wanna have a real change this effort must be bottom up, but another company trying to build it in their singular view of the world

> I think the folks involved in the European Commission’s [Next Generation Internet initiative](https://www.ngi.eu/) might look with some sympathy upon such efforts.

I think so too, and being funded by the LEDGER grant is a first step towards this. 
Within the next 6-9 months we try to formulate the vision of this data sharing infrastructure, build an MVP, getting 10-20 organisations using the infrastructure and then applying for some bigger NGI/H2020 grants beginning of next year to get it to maturity. 

> I find a bit less convincing that any single company be a good candidate for a long term fix. It’s great that WorldBrain is experimenting with non-speculative finance, but I would not stake too much on it. 

Agreed, specifically this data infrastructure should be a non-profit multi-partisan effort. As explained in the response to @anon1588924347, there will be 2 entities. 
> 1. [WorldBrain.io](http://worldbrain.io/) as a company which is the developer of (the current) open-source Memex and generates revenue by providing SaaS services to users.

> , but I would not stake too much on it. 

What makes you skeptical about that?

> and I am not impressed with the results.

Yes I see it similarly. I think the problem with those attempts was that they tried to use governance as a fix to counter the deeply embedded economic incentives of companies. After all if your company is built for growth (which inevitably become exploitative and power-centralising at some point), using governance to solve this is ineffective at best and fails at worst. 

The point of Steward Ownership is to systematically remove the incentives for greed behaviour (infinite potential for growth) by agreeing on a fixed return for investors/contributors before they invest time and/or money. Excess profits can then be used to improve the working conditions, supply chain sustainability, overall service, or simply be given away to charity. 

> If it is so, I think it could be made clearer by bolting it on top of Things that need to change, item 2, and explaining that items 1 and 3 are a matter for public policy.

Thanks for that suggestion, will see anon1138917760 I can incorporate it. 

However, I think you can't rely on solely public policy to change 1 and 3. Open-Source software (2) alone won't fix the issue either. I don't even think it is a hard requirement. Interoperability (1) and Steward Ownership structures (2) won't be freely adopted by existing corporations and it is expected, like with the GDPR legislation, that there will be major effort to counter interoperability legislation. And frankly it takes way too long. Time we simply don't have as humanity. So I think a move towards interoperability and Steward Ownership at scale can only work if the primary driver is technological innovation that changes the playing field. This may be supported by legislation at some point, latest when it becomes almost inevitable to strengthen interoperability efforts because of public pressure."

Based on what I know so far, I see interoperability and user choice about who stores the data and where, as your best shot to gain traction because that is most in conflict with the business models of the big monopoly platforms.  

Something I have noticed over the past decades is anon1138917760 many startups or rival businesses or enterprises had a product or service that was either bought or duplicated.  And that business either cashes out or goes under or someanon1138917760 finds a niche and survives. I saw this in the 80s with Apple and MS in their operating systems, I saw it in the 90s with MS Explorer, and in the 2000s with Google (maps come to mind for one) and Facebook up through today.  And I suspect that FB's new emphasis on private group messages is not just to stay out of the content moderation game, but is in response to a threat from Slack.

I am pretty sure you know this already, but when your product or service, that relies on either an Apple or MS OS, Google, FB or Amazon (and others surely) succeeds past a certain point, if they can copy it, they will. Either that or make you an offer you are not likely to refuse.

So making indexes and notations and sharing info...all of that is something they can reproduce.  But you know they won't allow someone to control their data and they won't play nice with everyone else, just like anon1138917760 Apple makes it harder to do things with Adobe when those two are warring..so making the things work that live in between the Big Boys and creating a kind of more protected value to the people who use it gives an opening I think."

Yes i see this too. With decentralisation as the main metric it may not be enough to provide better services. It's hard to beat the convenience and efficiency of centralised systems. 

> I am pretty sure you know this already, but when your product or service, that relies on either an Apple or MS OS, Google, FB or Amazon (and others surely) succeeds past a certain point, if they can copy it, they will. Either that or make you an offer you are not likely to refuse.

There are several factors that may not let that happen. 
1. WorldBrain.io is a Steward Ownership company. Once this transformation is complete, the company itself can never be sold. A golden share will be given to a foundation with the only purpose of preventing any sale of any shares. 
2. Interoperability (the freedom to move your data and friends) will presumably give people a freedom that is very hard to take again, once given. Thus the assumption is that over time other services effectively need to offer some interoperability to stay competitive. 
3. Actually the goal is that Memex and its features are duplicated and integrated into other (proprietary) services that allow to share the data inside those services more effectively. 

However these are all big assumptions and its not self-evident that these will play out exactly like that. 
The key will be to continuously try to set the market incentives so that it just becomes more profitable for existing organisations to be interoperable, because the market demands it."

I suspect that this is a guy who didn't do that; did the opposite in fact.  But in those pre-IPO filings, you have to lay it out honestly or you are committing a crime.  So, the whole picture came suddenly into full focus.  ""Whoops...so that's what's going on? No thanks, we'll pass."""

My name is Roberto Trevini Bellini, I have been suggested by a friend to join this very interesting community. 

Briefly, my story: after my studies in political sciences and international relations with a focus on human rights, I started working in the field of international development cooperation and humanitarian aid. I have worked for different kinds of organisations (NGOs, Italian Development Agency, European Commission, private companies), and for the last 5 years I have been project manager and trainer/consultant for a consulting company, especially working in the area of training and skills development for the development and humanitarian community, with the European Commission being our main client.

Development cooperation, with all its flaws and contradictory features, is (or should be) fundamentally driven by the goal of fighting inequalities and eradicating poverty. However, after 70 years of international development cooperation, while some progresses have been achieved, it is evident that inequalities are still growing. 
The age of the Internet has brought many new opportunities and challenges for the global fight for justice and equality. Technological advances have made knowledge, services and goods far more easily available to a bigger share of global population. However, the control over these resources is increasingly concentrated in the hands of few stakeholders (usually private corporations, and to a lesser extent public entities).


During my university studies, I followed a course about the governance of the global communication and information systems, which raised my awareness about the intimate link between anon1138917760 technology is designed and anon1138917760 much the users are (or aren’t) protagonists of the decision-making processes that impact their daily lives. 
For example, I am currently involved in the design and development of an online training programme, funded by the European Commission, to develop the skills and awareness of volunteers engaging in solidarity actions in Europe. We are just starting, but it is already evident that accessibility for everyone is key for the success and usefulness of the programme, as it is the direct involvement of learners in shaping the e-learning contents and modalities.


Another example is the possibility to use geo-spatial data to provide humanitarian or development services with the direct involvement of beneficiaries. 
In general, my curiosity is piqued by the possibility to develop technologies that can re-shape development policies and practices towards a needs-based approach instead of a donor-driven approach.


Besides strictly development/humanitarian aspects, I am interested in the role of technology, AI, social networks and IT tools that can empower citizens and foster democracy in an increasingly complex global society.

I look forward to joining the event and this community."

I'm a Design &amp; User Researcher who is interested to understand our complex world - especially the meaningful interactions between people, nature and the artificial. I have a Ph.D. in Design for Sustainability with a focus on values and cultural heritage. My skills are mostly based on my experience in design research and sustainable product development projects. I'm experienced in using various design tools and applying both qualitative and quantitative research methods as a means to understand the context as well as users' explicit and implicit habits and behaviors in order to generate solutions tailored to their existing situations.

**Motivations:** A discussion about taxonomy used in teaching or providing learning input in an AI provided insight about where these inputs originate from - people. This picque my interest as my Ph.D. research also explored the taxonomy of values that are attributed to products over time and across generations. These values are created, compiled, shared, evolved, exchange and also discarded. I find it compelling that our collective values essentially feed knowledge to AI which means it also inherit all the perceptions that humans have. Therefore, I believe it's important to understand and identify values that will be used as learning inputs for AI.

However, it would be an interesting experience to learn more about this subject, learned from the experts in the field and also shared my perspective about values that were attributed to products over time and across generations."

Earlier this year, Amelia Andersdotter (@anon3099529057), Alberto Cottica (@anon1075425386) and myself had a conversation about Europe, politics and tech.

Amelia has a lot of [hands on hands-on experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Andersdotter) around anon1138917760 to bridge the gap between the different actors and processes needed for political lobbying, design and implementation of policies in Europe.

It was a sweeping conversation about anon1138917760 in practice, the regulation of technology happens and where the real negotiations around power to implement policies (or not) take place. In this conversation we brushed on several topics and issues that together are resulting in EU and national policies stifling the ability of European companies to successfully compete with Chinese and US tech actors, and the values they espouse:

1. That we get lots of new policy on top of existing policy with redundancy and the implications of this in the long run.

2. The conflict between well-intended European Policymakers and national governments.

3. Role of standards bodies and anon1138917760 different actors relate to/navigate/use them.

4. The general difference between anon1138917760 US / China / EU institutions and national governments acts/relates to its technologies/goes about policy making / regulation.

We also discussed which skills, expertise and strategic alliances are needed to improve the situation. And anon1138917760 Edgeryders could better leverage our growing reach and presence in EUrope to contribute to this.

Rather than try to sum up the contents of a 3 hour, deeply technical conversation I have set this post up as a wiki for all of us to help flesh out one or more of the points above. To  set a good foundation for our discussions and events before, during and after the November festival."

Bringing in researchers, institutions - especially interesting now that there has been a very strong push for strategic standardization, securitization and industrial policy at different levels of EU governance (member states, Union level), while at the same time EU legislation tries to push in a direction of ethics, rights, rules-based governance (consider data protection or A.I. initiatives of late).

Maybe we need a round-table eventually or get some people in the same room for a workshop format on requirements on EU tech architectures?"

* We started by discussing the **signup process** again, which can appear rather complex, so here a break down of the general process:

1. Through this link: https://tell.edgeryders.eu/festival/ticket or through the ""get your ticket butanon3386180186"" on the minisite https://festival.edgeryders.eu/ people get to the sign-up form. in this form they are asked: Name, email, to select the event they want to attend from a roaster, and to introduce themselves a bit. 
They get this message:
""_Thank you very much! We will reach out to you via email with in the next 48 hours to give you further information and to discuss anon1138917760 to share your story best to confirm your ticket._""

1. The Edgeryders team send an email to each signed up person explaining anon1138917760 to sign up on Edgeryders and anon1138917760 to make their post to introduce themselves in relation to the event topic to **""activate their ticket""**

1. As soon as they post their post, they have their ticket


If you want to invite especially interesting people we offer to do an interview with them and write the post for them to get the most out of their time and topic. You could use the ""template for inviting experts"" from this document if you want: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cjY51Qsyl_3jtabQNLOFQxLJ6wm4kH83doy6nD78NbU/edit?usp=sharing

Any questions?

**Regarding reach out:**

We are going to set up a facebook event for each of the events on the minisite and make the organiser a cohost to make it easier to invite your network at large. However, if you do not use facebook and do have other channels that work better for you, use those :).

**You can find the  templates for flyers here:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11cDhmukccGqWkSpuCNWhdF3jpGFHPFGc?usp=sharing
Send us the copy and images to personalise them until Thursday the 24th of October or do it yourself/if that not possible we will just have it done by the designer from whatever they can find in your post with some copyright-free image. Please try to avoid that:

short title
short description/pitch line (line!  really keep it short, have a look on the template!

Finances:
Transport costs, food and such you need to pay and afterwards we will reimburse you, but invoices for facilitators and locations can be made out to edgeryders. Ad detailed description of that will follow and be linked shortly.

Updates from the projects:

@anon2289268721 will take over for @anon846549441 on the https://edgeryders.eu/t/workshop-on-service-design-in-a-climate-emergency-what-do-digital-services-in-a-world-of-net-zero-look-like/11070  
she is a professional facilitator of design workshops and we are excited to have her here. The date of the event is now the 28th of October

@anon3272854026 needs help to reach out to the academics and pedagogies networks in Sweden. (will post info shortly) 

@anon2896554156 has pinned down the location and is developing the event :slight_smile:

**The wellbeing events will not go through the signup funnel via the form, but instead directly ask people to post on the platform.**  

@anon2855557573 stressed that she is available for any questions regarding communication and outreach.

let's communicate and share! with each other and those we want to invite.

Booking the venue, inviting the facilitator's speakers and core guests as well as for deciding if they need and if yes distributing flyers and information physically on location is the responsibility of the organisers.

**The deliverables fo the events is having the participants sing up (see above) and post on the platform and the documentation: https://edgeryders.eu/t/documentation-methodology-for-edgeryder-events/11202**

**Be available to answer questions from people who want to participate in your event, or give us an alternative contact.**

 If you need a bigger team ask or hire help.

If you need help to find your way, ask for it here :slight_smile: 

We will start pushing the events via social media this week :)

Thank you to all of you who came to the call on the 15th 18:00 on ""reaching out, inviting and signing up to the festival"" and to everyone else working to organise something with us. Here is a summary of the call and the next actionable steps we discussed:

**1. Organising the events themselves:**

* Every organiser should be able to say if they or someone else take care of these 3 roles for their events. If it is yourself, please say so, if it is someone else, please list the name and role of that person in your event description and get us in contact with them so we can make sure they have everything they need :) :
1. **Facilitator** for workshops/talks/sessions planed. (These also include activists and participants who take a more active role in your event)

1. **Documentation organiser** Someone needs to be responsible for the coordination and partially conduct documentation for the event. Get them in contact with us to discuss our method for community documentation methods.

1. **Contact person for questions and logistics**

depending on your event you might also need to name other roles such as:

* (Reqiererement Engineer for hackathons)
* (Matchmaking organiser for networking events)

Ask yourself if you can take care of all of it, or if you need help. It will run smoother if you assign those roles. If you have a problem filling them tell us and we will try to help you find someone. Also, get the people you assign in contact with us so we can organise together more smoothly!

.
2. **Outreach:**
We will create a facebook event for each of the Festival events for you. IF you have questions regarding that ask @anon3306141428. We also commissioned templates for flyers for social media, which you can see [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11cDhmukccGqWkSpuCNWhdF3jpGFHPFGc?usp=sharing). We will prepare those for you, just provide us with:

1. A short title for your event

1. A one-sentence pitch description of your event

1. An image to put onto the flyer to which you have the rights, which either connects to your topic or sanon1138917760s you or one of your speakers/facilitators in action (in that case, please give us also their name)

_send those directly to me @anon1199199125 and load them up as replies to your festival thread and ping me and @anon3306141428_  

**We will also hire a journalist to interview all the experts and activists that are crucial to your event, their field and that we would to especially invite into the further discussion. Please provide us with the names and contact of the people coming to your event/invited to your event, which you think we should interview!**
.
**3. Sign Up:**
We set up the sign up via the minisite (https://tell.edgeryders.eu/festival_ticket). Everyone can sign up here and select the event they want to attend. We then answer them personally telling them anon1138917760 to activate their ticket by making a post with the organisers in cc.

* Personalise the templates for the answer emails for your event:
  * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cjY51Qsyl_3jtabQNLOFQxLJ6wm4kH83doy6nD78NbU/edit?usp=sharing
* Give us an email address which we can cc in the answer email of those who sign up to your event :)


.
**4. Budget:**
The Budget for For the NGI events is 12000 euro + 2500 euro for travel, for the pop rebel events there is a budget of 1000 euro per event, summing up to 3000 euro in total, which is taken from a different funding body.

1. Fill in your budget in as much detail as possible here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IIk5nCMebzEFqJ3ik4pp9vR8f65Wm5GuVCyUPgQ-o-Q/edit?usp=sharing

1. Remember to keep the receipts for anything you need to be reimbursed for

1. If what you need to pay is via invoice, like the location or the fee for the facilitator, you can have them make it out to Edgeryders directly, so you do not have to pay upfront. Contact @anon2039190938 about anon1138917760 to make those invoices.

In any case, here is his biography:

Prof. dr. dr. Dr. Canak (Dr. Nick) was educated in Novi Sad and Berkeley and has been educated at leading institutions in Europe.

He holds a PhD from US universities (Stanford and Cornell) and has been a Fulbright Foundation Fellow on two occasions.

He is the founder of the Education Center for Permanent Education ""NTC"" in Novi Sad, a professor at the University of Belgrade and Novi Sad.

Dr. Nick has worked in 52 countries, a renowned motivator, lecturer, doctor of medical sciences, professor of communication science, master of judo anon1420009626 arts, figure skating instructor, Fulbright Foundation Fellow, author of 13 books in communication science, Network Marketing, Success Psychology.

Immediate, confident, hyperactive - Professor dr. For many, Nikola Canak is a role model for a happy and meaningful life. He graduated from medicine because he wanted to be Dr. Kilder (the hero of the famous TV series of the 1960s). After 25 years, in the early 90's, in one day he emerged from the profession and opened the space for new professions: he began to pursue applied psychology and motivation.

He now holds trainings and lectures attended by several thousand people.

He is the creator of a complete system he called ""Total quality of life"", is a master of several anon1420009626 arts, is married and the father of seven children.

@anon3529867364 @anon2674660368 @anon1199199125 what would be your advice? 

It's not like the event will not work without him but I feel it would be very beneficial, increase our credibility and in fact, be beneficial for the whole wellbeing in Serbia project if we could get him on board in some way...not for the workshop but use the workshop to bring him in the Wellbeing in Serbia, hoping he will become our advocate of a sort locally.

So we are doing the Becej event before Belgrade?

About the guest, it depends on anon1138917760 much it costs to bring him. If it fits the 1000eur event costs great, if not we can book him later next year, when it will be clearer what the community needs. A mid solution is to just interview him and see what the response is. 
I pinned both your events on top of the Serbian Wellbeing category.  If you add photos to them, they will appear nicer on http://wellbeing.edgeryders.eu/srb
Also on that website, @anon2104307281 should have the registration form. Owen, please also send us the individual link to the form so we can post it on the platform? Thanks."

# How do we stop the brain drain from Serbia?

One of the solutions is creating a suitable environment for empowering youth. The most important resource, from any company or a country, are people. The investors put their money in people and ideas…in human potential, not in companies. Why? Because they know the company will never succeed without a great team. How can we expect to prosper as a country if we do not invest in the members of our society?

That is why we decided the theme of this workshop will be creativity and entrepreneurship. Our focus is on young people: anon1138917760 to we help them fulfill their potential? What kind of support do they really need from us? From parents, from the municipality, school or various organisations working with children, like for example the social care centers? Children with difficulties functioning within standard rules and education might need our help the most.
Our project was born out of that need to create an environment in which youth will flourish, in this case it will be the Becej Creative Hub, which we will present on this workshop.

## Format

We are creating a partnership made of individuals and all organisations in Becej who want to contribute to empowering young people and through that improve the quality of life in their community. This workshop and the project we will present during it will be the result of a poll we conduct between teenagers of 3 high schools in Becej. It will be built through their participation as well.

**Before workshop:** We connected with all 3 schools and few organisations, with goal of creating the needed partnership to and conduct the needed poll within the younger population so we can adapt the project to their needs as much as possible.

 **Why document everything:** The documentation from the discussions are redacted to ensure privacy of participants, then posted on the online discussion space for the festival. This enables us to do a number of things -

easily reconnect with people we met across shared/complimentary interests

build a high quality report summarising what knowledge has emerged from the discussions

keep everyone informed about new, relevant, opportunities for professional and personal development, follow up events etc

**Program:**

**Frequently asked questions**

**How do I get an invitation/ticket to this workshop?**

**How is this event being organised?**

This event, and the festival it is part of, is coordinated on the edgeryders platform (where you are now) and co-curated through a series of community video calls. We have allocated a collaboratively managed budget for the festival and operate on a solidarity basis. Participants who need some financial support to organise or be able to participate in the festival are eligible provided they contribute towards making it a meaningful and generative experience for all - in the run up to, during and/or after the event. If you would like to join us but are unsure as to anon1138917760 to contribute, don’t worry. Create an [edgeryders account](https://communities.edgeryders.eu/login), then [tell us a bit about yourself here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/ioh/tell-us-about-you) and we will guide you along from there.

Smil does a stanon204016368r job arguing that degrowth doesn’t necessarily mean *cutting down on all things*  but rather that growth and degrowth are essentially tools to use depending on context. For example, some countries below a certain poverty threshold should focus on growth (towards lower mortality, and increased nutrition and education) while other, richer countries could easily cut down and not miss much at all:

> “Once you reach a certain point, the benefits of GDP growth start to level off in terms of mortality, nutrition and education. (…) We could halve our energy and material consumption and this would put us back around the level of the 1960s. We could cut down without losing anything important. Life wasn’t horrible in 1960s or 70s Europe. People from Copenhagen would no longer be able to fly to Singapore for a three-day visit, but so what? Not much is going to happen to their lives. People don’t realise anon1138917760 much slack in the system we have.”

> ""To answer this, it’s important not to talk in global terms. There will be many approaches which have to be tailored and targeted to each different audience. There is  **this pernicious idea by this Thomas Friedman guy that the world is flat and everything is now the same, so what works in one place can work for everyone. But that’s totally wrong.**  For example, Denmark has nothing in common with Nigeria. What you do in each place will be different. What we need in Nigeria is more food, more growth. In Philippines we need a anon2726675500 more of it. And in Canada and Sweden, we need less of it. We have to look at it from different points of view.  **In some places we have to foster what economists call de-growth. In other places, we have to foster growth.**

It’s a fascinating debate, and certainly going to be a defining one for our era. The other day, my hairdresser gave me an unprompted lecture on anon1138917760 kerosene prices were too low and need to go up to prevent us from taking short term, long distance travel too often. If that isn’t a sign of this debate entering mainstream then I don’t know what is. *The times they’re a changing.*

[/quote]

_That_ is certainly true. The first targets for degrowth would be killing all that waste and bullshit in the system.

To illustrate that point, Graeber's well-know rant [about bullshit jobs](https://www.strike.coop/bullshit-jobs/) comes to mind. And also one of @anon2365388454's books – I remember anon1138917760 I loved that piece of fine work when I found it a few years ago, because it expressed for the first time exactly anon1138917760 I had always felt that modern society as a whole is not efficient at all in spite of all the automation and technology:

https://c4ss.org/content/5580

If I remember correctly, his result is that at least 40% of the 2010 U.S. American society's GDP is just that: production of waste. In other words, on average people could enjoy four-day weekends and nothing with fall apart.

We wanted to inform the Edgeryder community regarding an upcoming forest-related incubation program to find solutions to protect and regenerate our forests.

COACT works with early-stage, environmentally focussed technology projects & companies to grow their potential into actual impact. Unlike typical incubators, our objective is to maximise this positive impact rather than profit. We are young, idealistic, and deeply driven towards these ends. 

Please find details about the upcoming program below: 

We would be extremely grateful if you can share with your networks to help us find potential participants to join us. 


**Forest Protections &amp; Regeneration Incubation**


In December, we are launching our second phase, in which we will incubate two companies or projects working towards Forest Protection &amp; Regeneration. Both projects will come to live and work from the Valldaura campus 20 minutes outside of Barcelona in Spain from December to mid February 2020. 

Here they will have access to the Green Fab Lab (digital fabrication and prototyping facilities), a traditional wood shop (carpentry machines and tools), a micro permaculture farm, and 130 hectares of surrounding forest. Also included are food, accomodation and more general workspace.

We are currently in talks with a [project named Dronecoria](http://dronecoria.org/en/main/), who have designed a system of open source flying drones to distribute seeds and replant forests from the air. We are currently on the lookout for other projects aligned with the objectives of Forest Protection &amp; Regeneration.

We thought that many members of this community may be well placed to know of early stage technology projects or companies in this area. If this is the case, we would be delighted to hear from you indicating the projects and people behind them. 

A few things to be aware of in their criteria:

* They should be early stage and able to benefit from the facilities &amp; services we provide.
* They should be ideally european based, though we would likely make exceptions for an amazing project further afield.
* They should be willing and able to commit to the incubator for the duration, with a 2 week break over Christmas and New Years.
* They should be open to being filmed and document their work (our program is probably not appropriate for closed, traditionally corporate-style companies or projects).
* The attendees will need to be capped at 2 people per team"

Yes if it's about people feeding back into the grid. Not if it's about demand planning and all locally produced electricity is consumed locally or via direct connections to neighboring houses. The grid would still be a failover solution and backup, but there would be no need for the expensive certification process of grid-tried inverters. For more details about this concept, see:

There are multiple different scenarios it could be deployed in and depending upon which scenario you are going for depends upon who you talk to.

1. On earth, micro-grid scenarios with equipment from multiple different people: You would want to talk to NGOs/ and other orgs that set up away from current infrastructure and need something to manage demand/flow.
2. Grid attached solar/battery/e-vehicle setups: You would need to talk to grid management companies 
 (e.g. National Grid PLC in the uk) and the governmental regulators. 
3. In space, micro-grid scenarios with equipment from multiple different people: ESA, NASA, blue origin, CNSA.

You would need to do scenario two to achieve significant CO2 reductions, but it might best be approached from trying to achieve scenario one or three first. 

Currently I don't know which scenario is the easiest to approach, so I have to think about all three. I'm a anon2726675500 burned out from my previous project and current job stress, so it might well take me a while build networks or skills.

Energy companies have some protocols for communicating with smart meters, but it is not standardised so your smart meter [might lose smart functionality](https://www.ovoenergy.com/help/can-i-switch-energy-suppliers-if-ive-got-a-smart-meter) when switching supplier.

Another example of solving part of the problem is the [sion car](https://sonomotors.com/en/sharing/) can choose to share it's energy but mainly through the centralised app. This means you are reliant on an internet connection in order to be able to share your car and have the other potential problems inherent in relying on a centralised service (such as it going away or becoming less reliable). You also may want to share your energy on a mutual credit basis rather than selling it, so it may not suit you. I don't know of anyone who is trying to solve it in a decentralised way. These ways are hard to monetise and so hard to build a company around. But there may be something I don't know about."

My idea for Phloem is that the data would be owned and controlled by the user ideally. My idea for phloem is partially based on [secure scuttle butt](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/), where your various computers could follow your smart meter and store the data long term.

It gets more complicated when you try and figure out anon1138917760 much data to send to the energy companies. In a normal grid tied situation they need pretty accurate data, so they can both bill and predict energy demands. 

In a situation where you have your own battery they only need to know your demand for grid energy (and predicted demand), not your entire energy usage. This could hide some demand and preserve privacy a bit more, so they can't necessarily tell when you are home based on your energy usage, etc.

It both situations (and a long time from now, barring government regulation), you could imagine smart meters only sending their daily usage on a per house basis and the energy companies getting combined usage data from substations.

This would still allow power companies to predict demand accurately.

Just to let people know why I am not working on this at the moment, I haven't had much engagement from the protocol design people. So it seems unlikely to help with CO2 emissions in the next 10-20 years, which was my hope. It would need significant investment and interest from lots of different parties and lack of engagement from the people I expected to be most interested was pretty discouraging overall.

So I am currently looking at putting my technical skills behind things that will either definitely help a small amount in a short time frame, or potentially help a lot in the long time frame."

https://sites.grenadine.co/sites/iot/en/aarhus-2019/schedule/3500/Discussing%20Next%20Generation%20Internet%20Technology%20and%20Policy%20Workshop

How can we ensure not making the same mistakes as with the (failed) smart city (applications), but co-create services in the vertical applications (body/health, home/energy, car/sharing, region/collective intelligence) with all stakeholders including citizens? In this workshop we want to investigate the procedure of embedding these ideas and requirements in a Digital Signature for the Infrastructure. 

This has the important bonus it no longer matters who hosts the data and which platforms it runs, as the liability, accountability, procurement, GDPR and Cybersecurity Act compliance is in situational contracts (term Christian Nold), thus ensuring the new insights (fostering new services) stay well known to all stakeholders. In earlier workshops of NGI Forward WP3 the realization was made that in these 5G environments all entities (whether persons, goods, objects or situations) will be given federated and temporary identities, as in the case of an accident with the connected car in which all ‘stakeholders’ (the car, the person, the lantern pole that is hit, the water that the crashes into that is polluted…) receive temporary identities the ensemble of which becomes the ‘virtual accident’ the liability and accountability is administered on. 

Currently eIDas is the digital signature for persons, GS1 is providing product codes (‘passports’) for goods and coelition.org is mapping and numbering everyday activities. In these environments AI will run in the network and robotic capabilities are built in to function semi-auanon3386180186omously, the agency to name the combinations of the temporary and federated (attribute-based) identities will be vital to creating new services. Currently this agency is in the hands of GAFA and BAT.

In the case of architectures the first Salon put forward four building blocks. The  *first*  is that in an  *Internet of Humans* , or  *Next Generation Internet* , trust can be tokenized but only within a situation of already established trust between people, meaning there has to be a social understanding before it can be technically articulated, can we talk about communities and everyday life. The  *second*  is successful anticipatory regulation: “joint-up multidisciplinary regulation through collaboration platforms on AI that include startups, think-tanks and academia, large and medium-sized companies, governments and their ethics commissions, civil society and activists.”The  *third* is to explore building institution like entities with the concepts of  *data utilities*  and the work of Neil Lawrence and Sylvie Delacroix who propose  *data trusts*  as a bottom-up mechanism whereby data-subjects choose to pool their data within the legal framework of the Trust.

The responses to the Edgeryder Festival Call so far have sanon1138917760n that Berlin will be one of the hotspots for the ""real life"" meetings, events and workshops during the Edgeryders festival. (others are Brussels, Warsaw and Stockholm for example).

Especially the events planned n berlin will be very hands-on workshops and hackathons as it fits the community there very well. 

This means that we need to have locations for hose events.

Ideas have developed. 

@anon846549441 and @anon4187089231 both want to have their main workshop on the 22nd. We were wondering if you would like to/could have it in the same location if one of the options is big enough for two groups of up to 20 people if I understand correctly?

That would allow us to work together for set up and food and the participants could meet up during the lunch break for some cross-pollination?  

@anon3645150778, maybe your talk could fit in there in the evening? Or the following day, since Olivers team will stay around for multiple days. (which means they also look for sleepable places if possible)

So the [Hackathon we planned](https://edgeryders.eu/t/hackathon-for-ethical-solutions-to-unethical-problems-22-11-berlin/10769) will be during the whole weekend from 22-24. Topically it seems as if there are anon2298377336 some overlaps, and it would be great to be able to bring together the whole community. 

I figured it would be nice if a potential location we shared has the ability to still split the groups for their specific purposes on the 22nd. In our case we want to make quick intros of the participants/projects and the schedule of the weekend itself and then later go into socialising. Saturday morning is probably the Warm Data Lab about sustainability and then hacking/making until Sunday evening. 

I guess we are going to be around 40 people.

Recorded September 2019 for Edgeryders and NGI Forward

Zenna: 
Welcome to the first episode of the Edgeryders podcast with Zenna or anon215618117 for ""human centered internet."" Today, we are interviewing Noah Schoeppl. And the conversation will be exploring Noah's visions and thoughts of a utopian internet, as well as some of Noah's history. We've been talking anon2298377336 a bit ahead of time. And we recently got introduced each other. And it was kinda with a shebang and a lot of checkboxes. 

To give it a round about exploration of what you've explored previously, is it legal infrastructures mixed with AI and ethical complications that come thereof? And you've explored ethical hacking, and working with radically open security, as well as psychology and programming and many more it seems like, and now you're entering a master's program at Oxford? in like, two weeks? Yeah. To start off, if we if we go about it from a chronological order, where would that lead us to start?

Noah:  
I'm Noah. And I think my journey started as a politically aware and interested human being anon2298377336 young, I was 12 or so when I really someanon1138917760 caught fire for a topic that now is actually all over the world and more in the headlines, but back then was not so much. And it's really just like, anon1138917760 can we get to a world with hundred percent renewable energy as fast as possible. And that was my utopia, my first political utopia, that that really inspired me and got me going. 

And I came from a small town in southern Germany, and I started to like, travel to different places, try to like, you know, protests and all these things. This in touch with research institutions, and political institutions and things like all these things. And then there came a second phase at some point, because I realized, well, someanon1138917760 in the end, in all these discussions that I had with politicians and lobbyists and activists, in the end, you know, like, we can all discuss this, and anon1138917760, what's that there's an imperative anon1138917760 we need to change our world, due to the ecological boundaries of our world. But in the end, still, that the economic argument wins someanon1138917760. It always does in the political arena, or tends to, and I was really frustrated by that. And so it was like, Well, if the economic argument wins, maybe I should learn better anon1138917760 it works. And I really got into business ethics, and it was like back then, anon1138917760 can we reimagine anon1138917760 the economy and anon1138917760 businesses work, because to challenge that paradigm off that it's only about money making, and it's much more about human striving and the common good. And these are the contributions that companies should aim for. 

So from there on, I realized once we drive companies and what really shapes them, but companies also can be really slow, or they can become really slow to develop there as well. The single force that right now is changing companies in the economy most is technology. And so if we get this one, right, if we can get the technological technology to change, then that's also a really good opportunity to just change anon1138917760 our economy works, and anon1138917760 our society works for the better. So like technology is what's right now is the moving pieces that right now are, are shaping new things, and we have the opportunity to co-shape, our generation has to come opportunity to co-shape these technological changes. And I think that's opportunity I want to take so that we can use the technology together with our human insights and intuitions and values to make a more humane society and economy.

Zenna:  
So I'm, I'm curious. Now, we've talked a anon2726675500 bit about this before about the technology being power. And we also talked about anon1138917760 Oxford was Hogwarts. And coders are the wizards up today, Framing it in that perspective, is an egalitarian world something worth fighting for? And if it is, what is technology and the knowledge thereof, what place does that have?

Noah:  
I think, like generally I find, it can turn philosophy very appealing, particular, to the very rough like John Rawls idea that inequality, that the generally there should be, first of all, in terms of freedoms, they should be equal, and everybody should have some basic civil liberties. And then when we look at material conditions, that to be very rough again, the different principle is that according to John Rawls is that an unequal division of resources is only then legitimate, if it actually benefits those that are least well off. So when when an unequal distribution can meet that, for example, that overall, there's just much more resources, including for the for the less than the least, will have to go around. And I think, right now we're definitely at a point I would say, where we don't justify our current system is not justified by that, by that standard, in the sense that we use technology often not centered on the most vulnerable people in our communities and societies very much on emerging goals that already happened to hold. 

Also Silicon Valley culture, even if it purports to claim the world, to save the world, really is the end, although startups gets bought up by by venture capitalists that already are basically, that then again are owned by the ones that already currently own the world. Self-feeding. Exactly. And again, I find it sad that all this beautiful technology that could be built into really meaningful things in the end, like I mean, nobody says that all the social media companies we have now or all those giants needed to go to the direction they had to it was just that's the society in which technology arrived was one in which these kinds of innovations were immediately put into, under profit, maximizing pressure.

Zenna:  
And copyright?

Noah:  
And copyrights is also one part of it. Yes, I could imagine very different ways of arriving there. But then again, I think my my philosophy that I developed around this is kind of really being willing to think, very radical, very big about anon1138917760 things could be different, but then really starting from where we are right now. So I really don't like just complaining about anon1138917760 things should be very different. And I gotta do fix. And it's also when I yeah, I mean, I didn't like only talking about business ethics, but I also got into social entrepreneurship and founded companies myself and try to try to not just talk about anon1138917760 business should be run differently, but I tried to do it. And it's hard. 

Zenna:  
just as a tidbit, what's goal that you found from your time in there, and I don't mean, goals as in capitalist values, but as in, what did you find that you brought with you on your new journey?

Noah: 
I think generally, the, the methodologies of business can often be very useful if they are used to different ends. So like, basically, the idea of one Europe is to find a social business, to use business means for social ends to solve really social problems, and not for the kind of problems they've been conventionally associated with. But that's not an original thought. So even though I want to credit it, but I think one more additional thought that I had was kind of like that it really helped me to develop my own philosophy that I call pragmatic idealism. At this point, I can summarize in three models, and first kind of is hope without critical thinking, is just naivety, but critical thinking without hope is just cynicism. And then the second idea is confidence without humility, is just arrogance. But then humility, without confidence, is sheepishness.

Zenna:  
And that's your own personal philosophy for anon1138917760 you see yourself throughout the world?

Noah:  
More people that inspired us include Maria Popova, Bulgarian writer, but also many others. And then like the last sentence kind of is more like the synthesis of it all I would say, which is pragmatism without idealism is just opportunism. But idealism without pragmatism is just wishful thinking. So that's kind of my, that's my philosophy. That kind of is the goal, I would say, I found that pragmatism and idealism need to work together. Yeah, the, I think, especially like, the first two are probably more inspired by other people. Pragmatism and idealism, they live in the space between the two. And so really have ambitious goals, but also be really pragmatic, where you start with it.

Zenna: 
if we go back to the origin of the ambitious goals, so to speak, if you were to start sketching out the image of what those ambitious goals for, let's say, if you want to reshape the internet, plural, What would that look like for you?

Noah:  
There can like I don't have like one overarching but I think I have several again, utopias for this, or different utopian visions. I took an international relations course in my undergrad degree in Amsterdam and social sciences and I was thinking about well, anon1138917760 does international relations in global politics fit into cyberspace that we increasingly live in, and the internet and, and just writing and trying to combine this global politics theories with these new technologies, and then I just for some reason, wrote these words like cyber peace and cyber war. And I just noticed that my computer some enough reason underlined cyber peace as like an unknown word, but CYBER WARS recommend. And then it actually was, and I looked up in different word processing programs, none of the new cyber peace, but all the new cyber war, I looked up in different almond dictionaries and make not all of the new cyber cyber war, but very few use cyber peace. And so it was just like, Well, that's interesting, the vocabulary that we have in the conceptual space of the internet, is we conceptualize it as war, we don't even know anon1138917760 to talk about it in terms of peace, because we don't have a word for it. And just that obvious asymmetry that it someanon1138917760 needs to be a very aggressive and violent place, apparently out there. And this is the language we use. That kind of made me think there's some utopia missing. And they're starting to develop that a bit more in this economic context, initially, where and for example, what I find interesting is, when you look at cyber peace, maybe we look at peace in the real world first. And like there were always like ideas of world peace, they've always existed, but someanon1138917760 we've not achieved it yet. So just one very common idea of world peace was always Immanual Kant, philosopher, who, in 1795, wrote an essay called perpetual peace, for some reason, the original, they basically purported that just the simple hypothesis kind of is the states with a republican constitutions of democracies, basically, they should all just guarantee each other security. And when they do that, then we could have an ever expanding unit of peace, because nobody would ever attempt to attack such a block of countries. And we could have an ever expanding unit of peace.

Zenna 
One thing that's been discussed recently, especially in the realms of internet and internet infrastructures, is the issue of centralization. In that kind of utopian image of a block of peace, one can say a block of Empire, which would then set the frame for the rest of the world.

Noah 
Absolutely agree. And like, I think it's really interesting that like, actually back then, again, I don't want to get too much into wrap Kant up. He said, We don't need a centralized contract or institution for this. We don't need a treaty for this, this would just emerge out of enlightenment, basically, enlightened actions of, of individuals and countries, again, 18th century philosophy maybe doesn't completely extend the internet. But I think there are some interesting things when you actually apply it. 

And again, because the internet is a very different beast. If you look at the long term trends, again, we have not achieved real peace. But overall, we live in a more peaceful world than ever like than ever before. In less than two years, we did have a lot of progress. And I think we should continue to have that progress. Because right now, when we speak about the internet, we just speak a lot about, like, there's a lot of outs, and so insecure and get cybercrime and a cyber war between the countries and all that. And I think that what we really should aim for is really to have this this utopian vision and anon1138917760 I think that can actually happen in cyberspace, much more than in real world, think cyberspace is actually could be a much more peaceful place, then then, then the world we live in physically. And that is because of the different dynamics of security in the cyberspace. It's very asymmetric. And it's very different from other security, thinking of like 20th century Cold War thinking, which often has been the only dominant security paradigm has been applied the internet, because the common story is internet you just, like you don't know who's your attacker, basically, it's very difficult to do attribution of attackers. So you just want to develop your own offensive capability and hack everyone. And you can just do it in the face with us I've been doing in Russia, I've been doing in China for doing, many other countries aspire to do. And there's also again, like the superpowers that are emerging, it's basically trying to copy this old patterns into this new world. And I don't think, first of all, I don't think that's anon1138917760 it's going to work out. And first of all, don't think it's desirable, and it doesn't work that way. And that's because because of this asymmetry and the internet, that you don't know who your attacker really is, attribution is very difficult. So you can't retaliate, just to keep because you have offensive capabilities, right? Because you have cyber weapons, because you have the vulnerabilities that you know about, exploits that you can enter into other systems. Just because you can attack someone doesn't mean that they want to attack you, because you again, the offensive capability you have is not a deterrence against somebody else's attack, which in the physical world is very different. If you have a nuclear bomb, you know, the other person is not going to bump you so much because you can bomb them back. This logic of, of Cold War in that sense doesn't work anymore in the internet. A second reason for that is basically you can destroy somebody else's offensive capability by building up your own defenses. So if you do really good, actually security for yourself, and if you do security research, and you find vulnerabilities and you find zero days, then you can basically destroy the offensive capabilities of others because they rely on these vulnerabilities. And so, you know, if I have a nuclear bomb, just because you build some protection doesn't mean I don't have a nuclear bomb. But if I have a zero day, which is basically an exploit to which no fixes there yet, and you close that, that gap, that I don't have a bomb anymore, I don't have a weapon anymore. So basically, you can take away somebody else's offensive capability by building good defenses. I think these dynamics have not been fully understood by policymakers.

Zenna:  
Is that something you would call sign of peace? You can build up defenses and by having a safety rather than offensive?

Noah: 
Yeah, I think like that, when my vision for several pieces that states should end and everything out everybody else, I don't think security must always be so state-centric, my vision for cyberpeace is that, basically everybody in a certain union, and it doesn't have to be a contractual union, works towards building collective defenses. So basically, these are two very basic things. zero day reporting, a global norm for zero day reporting, that's countries that join a certain even even even just an idea that they would never did follow this idea can start to report zero days and never include and never improve not only their security, but security of everybody else. And again, like many people might say that sounds so super idealistic. And I don't think it is, I think it is very pragmatic reasons to do so. Because if you're part of this defensive union, then you can really you will be much safer than if you're if you don't share any of you zero days, and you twist try to get keep and build your own offensive capabilities for all the reasons that I've named, because on offensive capabilities can be destroyed by enemies, and because of having offensive capability is not a deterrent against attacks.

Zenna:  
So if you have a union, there must be something that's in it for them, there's the <CAN""T INTERPRET THIS WORD>  Is that what you imagine, for a utopian internet?

Noah:  
Generally, again, I would apply this kind of Kantian idea that in the end, we want to live on a peaceful planet or in a peaceful cyberspace. My vision is that we, in the end have a safe space in the internet and that place in that sense that we start by creating small safe spaces, and they start expanding until in the end, hopefully they cover I always think that will be like, there will always be cyber attacks. But we can minimize the impact that we can increase our the integrity of our of everybody's experience in the internet by for example, having a global norm for zero day reporting. And I find what I like about the global norm for zero day reporting is it encourages everyone to contribute to everyone's security, because you can't just close the zero day vulnerability for yourself, you do it for everyone. And at the same time, the only them that basically you create is the people that don't want to work together to make everyone's experience safer. And the them is basically the people that want to keep the exploits to, for example, I don't know, whether it is NSA hackers, or whether this malicious Russian hackers or whatever, whatever groups, only the people that kind of want to be able to really attack other people systems are then kind of that that will be against, I think the what would I like with this is it's not so much that I have a very clear institutional setup, anon1138917760 this would work, because obviously, it's very difficult to control these kind of things. Exactly. So I don't it's not fully developed. But I think it's kind of like my point is more like this narrative shift from we talked about a place where there's a lot of war happening, cyber war, to a place where cyber peace is possible, and where we should make sense of peace, not cyber law or cyber war.

Zenna: 
Whose responsibility is it to make this shift happen?

Noah: 
I think in the end, it's everyone's, but I think, if I should put my my my hope on, for example, individual institutions, I think institutions that are very well set to do this, or where I have realistic hope for this is the European Union. So if the European Union were to start such a project, where it say, okay, we, as a group of countries decided we want to start a norm, that what everyone ought to report zero days, because it's better for everyone to do that. I think that could be very powerful. And I know that the current administration, for example, in the US, which obviously controls the most powerful capability there is not going to willing to do that. But I hope that that could change given also the large trajectory of history, I hope that it is possible. Also for other countries, I hope that they that in the same way that we didn't think it seemed impossible to ever start a counter proliferation movement in the nuclear age. And it seems we will for eternity, always just create more bombs to kill each other. We now actually live a world where there's still too many bombs, but at least less than 50 years ago. And in the same way, I have a hope that in 50 years, I know it's a long shot. And it's not going to happen overnight. And right now, all the talks on your end level are basically non existent on this topic. So it's I really hope that we could live in a world where we have less, not more attacks and more integrity of everybody's devices.

Zenna: 
You've been working a bit with AI and machine learning, and specifically on the focus of whether it's ethical, if placed in a legal system. Do you want to expand on that?

Noah:  
Yeah, of course. So I think kind of like that was my work that I started, or did two years ago that I kind of talked about this narrative shift to cyber peace. And what I didn't like about it is that it was apart from that it was like state centric, and that there were many practical problems with it and very long shot, it was still defensive, it was still like it's talking about my utopia is security or safety, which is still something like the absence of violence. That's the problem with peace. Also, you know, it's not medicine super positive, it's only that bad things are not there. And so I was like, I want something more positive than that. And and that's then where I got also more into this AI space. And because I think they're really there is opportunity to positively shape human thriving in many ways. And to unlock this potential that we need to avoid many risks that are often also discussed and that are very real. And the as I said, also, I wonder, and they I feel I don't have this super clean utopia, because someanon1138917760 every utopia that involves machines that can do more than we do, in some sense, apparently ends up being a dystopia sometimes. And so we have to still do a lot of work on which utopia, we actually want out there.

Zenna: 
 In your utopia, does AI exist?

Noah: 
In my utopia. Again, I'm a pragmatic idealist. So my someanon1138917760 my ideals are also based on my pragmatism. And I think there is not a world possible. Like we cannot, I don't know if you heard about the unabomber, who's like a, like a guy who started basically bombing scientists, because he believed that the progress of science and technology would destroy human society. And given that I don't think that's a viable path that we will have, that we will basically live with less technology, then the question is, anon1138917760 can we shape the current trends and the current technologies that are rising to human benefit? And also maybe sometimes also, anon1138917760 can we consciously decide not to use them? Yeah, we can sometimes do that. 

But overall, I'm convinced that we will get machines that will be better than humans at many tasks that currently only humans can do. Given that that's going to come, the question is, anon1138917760 do we want to do that? I think their biggest problem are, exactly about human centrism. So anon1138917760 can we make sure that they align with our values and their <unknown>? Like that's a long term perspective, I would say all this question, which is kind of like AI governance questions that says when, for example, pioneered by Nick Bostrom, the whole ideas of what do we do when general AI actually is smarter than humans? I think these are super valuable questions to do with and to research. 

But then there's also the short term questions, and that's what we're after dealing with these important questions of, if we already today have for example, a system that makes legal decisions, for example, in an administration and that public administration, what laws do we want to be imbued into that? Do we think it's just fine if there's some human mandate and humans and some democratically elected institution decides now we want this to be done by an AI? Or do we also think there needs to be some outputs that need to be in some material sense fair, as it just if it's if it's cheaper and faster do we just accept it? Or do we also want to actually be able to understand the process to be accessible for humans, because then many advanced machine learning programs, currently, they're black boxes for us, so we can't really understand them. 

And the other question is, well, if it's trained on any human data, human centric data, also in that sense, then it's going to take human vices with it, and it could even aggregate them and exaggerate them. And so yeah, there's a lot of open questions, and I don't really have full answers to those yet. But my utopia is just I can only explain it in very abstract terms at this point, because there's a lot of research and thinking and testing and acting to be done on this field. But right now, it's to reap the benefits to avoid the risks, and to make sure that we humanize the technology that we live with, in the sense that in the sense that we really challenge also what it means to be human for ourselves, because I don't think we know right now what it means to be human. And if we first figure out like, or if we figure out what it means to be human, then we can also tell when we want technology to do to help us to thrive.

Zenna: 
Thank you so much for forth your thoughts. I'm that feeling that we will hear more from you.

Noah: 
Well, thank you very much for giving me this space. And I'm very grateful for your time and for your work."

Welcome Peter Bihr to our community call today. Delighted to have you. I don't know anon1138917760 much everybody knows about Peter and his work. But I spent a lot of yesterday reading your writing, your website, looking at all the things you do. You're a prolific writer, you have the ThingsCon conference that you've been doing, you have The Waving Cat, you do consulting, you're a young parent, you started a company that makes pants, you have a travel magazine that is kind of crowd sourced blog thing. What a renaissance man. Where do you find time to do all these things? 

**Peter** 0:41  

Well, the good thing is, I don't have to do them by myself. So that makes it a lot easier. The things I do most of us basically just what you mentioned, the way we can, that's my company, that's essentially the administration anon2726675500 back end to make everything work. That's that's the consulting firm. And that makes it a lot easier. Thanks. 

Con is the other big project that takes the other half of my time mostly. That's a nonprofit, but that's a bigger team. So that, you know, that's not just me, that makes it easier. And the rest are kind of like side projects that were other teams, or are really like on a very like small slave. So that makes it a lot easier. It makes it sound more than that. It really is like the way the Cat the consulting part around smart cities and emerging tech. That's the commercial part. And the things con is the nonprofit advocacy part of the whole thing that started as a conference, and then turned into a whole online community where essentially, we work with a lot of professionals and practitioners in IoT to make sure that it gets done a anon2726675500 bit better, and not just faster and easier to exit later.

**John** 1:40  

Your current research focuses on smart city governance, what specifically Are you looking at with that?

**Peter** 1:47  

So when we look at smart cities, like anything that's connecting the urban space, let's keep it like very open and broad for now. Anything that is internet connected or collect data sensors that enables administrations to run decision making algorithms, that kind of stuff, anything called Smart Cities, and - small footnote: I go through this whole spiel that that's all encompassing because the term Smart City is a very specific industry shape term is like it's essentially an IBM term more or less, that they kind of brought into the world. And like all the vendors that make smart cities acknowledges use that term. And it comes with some baggage. But I mean, whenever we connect public space, essentially, we, I think, need to look at anon1138917760 that works. Because if you look at my home, it used to be a private space; home in the in the global West used to be a private space. And now because we embed connected microphones, it's not so there's a phase change of some sort. And similarly, if you look at the public space, the moment we started tracking the movement of people through space, or we imply algorithms to make decisions about where to put the next fire station, or who gets to use which road or that kind of thing of who gets routed which which way that happens in public space. And unlike if I buy a naked gadget for myself, in public space, there is not opting out, if they want it or not. And so I think it's like this, the smart home was a face to face for privacy, the Smart City, I think is a face change for who gets to control the public space in a way and who gets to shape it. And I think that's like a profound change for governance. 

Because right now, most of what we see, and this does not happen with any malign intentions, as far as I can tell, it's just like a thing, where the companies that make technology could connect public space or network companies, they are data analytics companies, they are logistics companies, companies that know anon1138917760 to track movement of physical things to physical space, and companies who know anon1138917760 to extract meaning from data. Those are the companies, the Ciscos and Googles - the waterways of the world. They know anon1138917760 to network stuff, and anon1138917760 to extract meaning, from the data that's created. And so with them, when they transfer the knowledge from advertising technology into the public space, or from global supply chain optimization into public space, they import along with them a certain logic of thinking about the space to us. And that is not necessarily compatible with what we know works for a rich life, or civic life in the city. And so that's the slightly heavy way to think about this. But really, the question is, who gets to control? what's allowed in the city? Is it the vendors of technology? Or is it the citizens who live there, and what we see in practice is that the vendors are lobbying city administration like crazy to just implement stuff, and then test it. But once it's implemented, realistically, it's never going to be taken back out. Again, once it's in there, it's established. 

And so we're in a really pivotal point right now where I think we can help shape the discourse of what we actually want to see in public space. And what we don't want to see there by establishing first participatory practices that say, Okay, if we're going to put something in public space, we're going to have a process where it's not just something where a vendor sells a city something without public oversight, or with not very meaningful public oversight. And then everybody's just stuck with it for like, 25 years in a IT support situation.

**John** 5:24  

You make the comment, at one point in your writing, don't leave something this important to a bunch of tech Bros. You also made the point that technology is political.

**Peter** 5:35  

Yes. And so as I think these lines are both very closely interrelated. I'm a political science and communication science major by background. So while I've never worked much in that field, I do think a lot about anon1138917760 things are political. And it always sounds like an abstract kind of late at night red wine discussion. But really only it means who has the right to change the rules, if we don't? Who gets to decide what's allowed? What's up? With whom? What's good for whom? How do we measure what's good, right? And silence these questions. There's never going to be a perfect answer. But the quest of finding an answer and discussing this is really important. 

When I refer to the bro culture, I mostly mean, that's really, a lot of the products we see out of Silicon Valley. These things are made by young fairly well-off men for their peers. There's nothing inherently bad about this. But this is not a representation of the world. This is a very narrow section of anon1138917760 we go through the world. There's gender issues, there's control issues. There's racial components to this. But there's also, just like a wealth gap issue, always part of this, a lot of smart cities stuff, for example, that's the secret. This is what's called pay for place. So of course, it's it sounds like a fair argument to say, Hey, if you're going to use the service, you should pay for it, that's fine. But on the other hand, there's a good reason we provide some stuff for free, because we don't want stuff to be exclusively available. If you're rich enough to afford it. There's some stuff, and sometimes it's more than others, but where we just think this is really important that this is what means civilization, and it goes the same for us. So this is going to be available for everybody. To a certain degree that starts with stuff like clean air, to some degree, it starts with affordable public transport. It is available in some countries. I come from Germany, I live in Germany, public health care, that's not free, but it's very affordable is one of those, Where does it start and an end. That's the thing that every society has to decide for themselves. But that everything should just work really, really well, for young single men who are 25 and get 250 grand a year, it should also work for like a young Hispanic mom, who has to get by on 30 grand a year and may have three kids, some things should not work for just fairly rich white guys.

**Christian** 7:55  

I, I think one of the main reasons why things go wrong or tend to go wrong is because usually the sensor package and the action package get put into one thing, the person or the organization, who does the monitoring of traffic is also the same organization that then controls the traffic. And because that data never gets used. Otherwise, the interesting part of what make smart cities or internet of things for the city is if we have on one side, anon2726675500 machines or anon2726675500 computers that generate data, and that sanon1138917760 data to people and make it available publicly anonymized pro certain point or whatever. And when on the other side, we have services that use that data, and then provide services based on that. And as long as we keep this device intact, we have publicly available data sources. And then the option to use that data and then have paid services, free services, open source services, things made by enthusiasts and things made by new companies that do something, we can have all the good things there and we make even the bad things, but we can act on it, we will have the option to say okay, this company is doing bad things with data, we're not buying there anymore, or we as society decide to shut them down. But we still have the upside of being able to use the data. There's a friend of mine here in Berlin working on a project where they are basically adding very simple sensors to elevators with a long term goal of making all this sensor data on the elevators publicly available, and then have a disability-friendly map of buildings know that at the train station, the elevator is not working before you're there. So you can take the train to the next train station where there is a working elevator.

And that works because there is this divide between our sensors delivering data, and the services we make use of. And if we do that, for traffic lights for traffic control for congestion, for smart air quality, noise levels, anon1138917760 many people are walking down the street right now? Is it full? Is it full of tourists or not all that and then allow people to make choices based on their data and you have apps or things working on that. That's a whole other thing.  

I don't know anon1138917760 many of you read Wired magazine back in the 90s. There was always on the last few pages, the column by Nicholas Negroponte. In one of those, he painted a dystopian and utopian picture of the city. And on every corner possible, there was a surveillance camera, and all the cameras collecting all the data and all the images from everywhere. And in one city, all the data went to one entity, surveilling everything. And in the other city, that was just open video data. Anyone could at any point, go to any camera and look for it. There was no central authority on that. Anyone could look up, yep, I'm going to look to this camera right now, and could save the stream just in case or not. Which of these cities will be nicer? They are both surveillance states that the one has some sort of crowd control on it, where people can look at this and can get to the data, even if a police is doing something wrong. And that's where the power dynamic comes into play. And I think this is something that is really important for public internet of things, that the data that is being collected should be available to the public.

**Peter** 11:47  

They're really important points. So thank you so much for sharing that. So first, you touched on, stopping to work with a company if they happen to abuse that data or if they're just not good enough, that's a really good point. Like currently, most Smart City contracts have these long built in contracts where it's IT infrastructure that you don't easily switch back and forth. And that's a question of procurement that's only solved at the stage of buying public infrastructure and defining terms of data portability, and that kind of stuff and exit strategies and making sure they’re not too proprietary, there's a really big lock there. And even if you have to use some providers stuff, which sometimes might happen, I think there's still practices to make sure you can move to a different vendor. So that's absolutely important. 

You touched on publicly available data, like open data, like strengthening the data comments, essentially, which I think is a tremendously powerful thing that we've only seen the tiniest first steps on. It feels like there's a lot happening. And there is but, I think if you look back in 10 years time, it will look like the tiny, tiny bit of the curve where it just goes up a anon2726675500 bit. And this anon2726675500 mountain that's like a big hockey stick curve. There is a downside to that too. Where going back to like what Negroponte wrote there, we all thought like that in the 90s. And up till maybe like fairly recently that publicly available data also means evenly distributed power dynamic. And only now do we find that if it's publicly available, it could also very easily be abused by much more capable organizations like the New York Times that have fantastic interactive piece, maybe maybe three months ago, maybe a anon2726675500 longer, where they tried to track individuals through like a cheap, I'm not sure if it was Microsoft or a Huawei Chinese tracking software like facial recognition software. And they just cooked it up with publicly available video feeds around Union Square over a week and tracked people that they could identify with a very high confidence, and they took their sample data. If I if I remember this correctly, I think they took the faces of the company websites around unit square, and then run it through the facial recognition software, and compare that to the video feeds. So there is an element where it's very easy to start being really invasive with this. And I'd have no solutions for this whatsoever. Maybe maybe just no video cameras whatsoever. Maybe that's maybe the radical kind of Luddite approach is like the only one that works. But I don't feel comfortable proposing that. It does have interesting friction there, right. TI think that maybe that's the best I have to offer. There's interesting trade offs there to make sure. But also, there's recently like a wave of new companies that actually also figured out better ways to do video recognition stuff in public space, but do it with a full respect of privacy where on device they filter out faces, or number of plates of cars, or where they track footfall in retail spaces, but only looking at the feet. And someanon1138917760, through gate recognition managed to get fairly robust demographic data for retail spaces by only ever looking at feet, which I would be kind of surprised that someone found a way to make that a horrible thing. Yeah, that seems like a very, very sensible approach, like if you can actually make that work. But there's a New York City based startup that collects traffic data like cyclists and cars in public space. And they automatically filter out all the faces and the number plates. And so you get traffic analysis. But like nothing ever leaves the device is all further up on device seems to me like a really powerful point of leverage, where you don't have to trust the company to have good Privacy Practices later on, if the stuff never gets collected to begin with. So that's not like criticism about the points. Like that's a that's a very clear Yes. And there's there's a really interesting part about the decentralization and the commons, kind of like leveling the playing field here that I don't think solves all the problems. But it certainly is a much better start than just having one company collect all that stuff and go crazy. 

**John** 15:49  

It maps directly right back to technology being political, because in order for that kind of benign vision to even be possible, it isn’t enough to have a democratic society, you have to have more than just that. You have to have an aware society. 

In your writing, you talk about your anon2726675500 privacy dial - a anon2726675500 thing in your home that dials up anon1138917760 much privacy you want at a given moment. You have another example, there's a kind of a fob you could carry around in public that would let you have some kind of control over your environment, which I thought was a wonderful idea. 

**Peter** 16:31  

Well, I'm always hopeful. There was a small piece of speculative fiction as part of an exhibit for the DNA Museum in London, where they explore the impact of tech on society. And we just played around with known interfaces trying to have them do stuff to give you control of your data. And these are complete purely visual mockups, the box to do anything but latest LEDs and the favelas, literally some some piece of metal and a kitchen and some some Sugru or something. But the idea was that just like we know anon1138917760 to turn on and off, up or down the volume on an old hi fi system, you could just say, hey, all my smartphone devices go through this thing. And when I want my home to be as assistive as possible in the mornings when I have to get ready for work, and maybe have kids running around or whatever, I want all the efficiency that they can offer me. And so as I say, you know, I'm going to wind down the privacy part, but I'm going to let it do all its smart and loose and support stuff that it could possibly do. Whereas, in the evenings, I might sit down with my partner and just want to want to have like a quiet conversation and might not need that level of assistance, I'm going to turn the privacy all the way up. And I won't need all the smart stuff, I'm just going to have my privacy now. And in a very intuitive interface. This model, of course, breaks down really fast when you like try to map what it actually means in context. So it's really like it's a speculative fiction piece. And a fairly simple one at that. 

You all know the feeling when you're invited to a friend's birthday or something. And in my my peer group, my circle of friends, there's like a bunch of people who really like Internet tech, but also are others who are real hardcore privacy activists. And so you'll always have like a bit of this tension, which is maybe too much of a word. But, clearly, there's there's different interests coming into the room where some people want to share with you on Instagram, and others don't want their photos to be taken at all. Preferably some check in on Foursquare others would rather have you know, like a Wi Fi blocker, but whatever the range might be. And the idea with this fob thing was that, what if we just have a thing on a key chain where we kind of set a default, where we define what, generally speaking, I want in public spaces such as, I don't mind my movement to be recorded, but I don't want my face to be seen in public and in private space at home I don’t want anything being recorded, when I go to like someone, I don't go through three to three degrees of separation, I might only be comfortable having either recorded or presence recorded, but not audio, whatever the things may be the match your personal preferences, as you could just have them set. And when you walk into a room, the room would be smart enough to recognize and also respect all that these wishes and fulfill them. Of course, like I said, that would mean first of all, that all the infrastructure is in place, which of course, it's not. That every vendor, every app maker every hacker like agrees to these rules and respects them, which of course is like a wish we would live in that society. And also, we all need to agree that that's actually even something desirable. And that needs to be respected. And of course, that's like the next thing. We need to be able to trust the whole chain to respect that decision, and to work. And of course, this is never going to happen, right? This is like, when we talk to these people who are not technologists at the VNA in London, it was really interesting, because people got the idea. The moment you mentioned, both of these, they're like, Oh, yeah, I can set my stuff here. And then I can just walk in and the place knows what's cool. Like, that makes sense to me. I want to dial up and privacy down. First, there was like a bit of a question around like what a smartphone even does but then, and they're like, Oh, yeah, that makes sense. I want that. Can I get that? And of course, the answer is no, absolutely not. The moment you have, the microphone, you kind of got a hope at Amazon. And all the makers of apps on the on the Amazon Echo are trustworthy enough to respect your choices. Maybe they are, I hope they are.

**John** 20:30

So you have a smart city. And you set it up where maybe it doesn't anon2298377336 go all the way. But let's say part of the way toward this, and no doubt the people of Toronto, people in government of Toronto, I mean, I wasn't sitting in on the pitches, but I've been to plenty of pitches to government and high up people who don't really use this stuff or completely understand it and you dazzle them properly. They'll say, Oh, yeah, okay, we want this, that sounds really benign and cool. And we'll get that going and won't be exactly the way you describe a better vision, but it'll kind of work. And the people running Toronto, you know, are pretty good people, I think in their hearts and stuff. However, all you gotta do is get some people in who don't feel that way, who flip a few switches. And suddenly, you have a pretty dystopian situation, like I see in China. I saw 911, here in America in 2001 change our society very profoundly. Everybody was all freaked out. And in the end, during all that panic, all kinds of horrible laws got passed, at least horrible in my opinion, to essentially surveil us all in order to make us feel more safe. And so then you get Obama, a guy who has a strong belief in certain amount of civil liberty and personal control, who understands the technology and did have to engage with the national security state. And I can only imagine what that must have felt like, I'm not going to second guess the man's political instincts. But you know, he dialed it back a anon2726675500 bit, but that structure was largely already in place. Okay, now we have Donald Trump, he and his people are completely comfortable with mass ignorance and a high level of surveillance. And he has millions of supporters who are perfectly fine with that. I'm reiterating the point that whether you like it or not, technology really is political.

**Peter** 22:47  

When it really touches the most personal parts of a man just like this, with a strong power dynamic, which, of course is government to citizen relations. There's always a point that I'm making - it mostly doesn't play the day to day the way it should - that the citizens rule through the government, but rather there is a slight disconnect often where governments can come into power. And they might totally use all the established infrastructure and the data you collect for not the originally intended purposes. Often for nefarious purposes. Like I said, I'm German, I studied German history, there's like two states in like the last less than 100 years, that essentially run to a large degree on large scale data collection, spying on citizens and absolute abuse of power at the expense of a lot of large minorities, mostly, and often leading to horrible, horrible, horrible results, first the Nazi regime, of course. And then also, isn't Germany also like a big surveillance states compared to today's level of surveillance? Of course, this looks like peanuts, but it ran very efficiently, right. And so these are things where oftentimes we see infrastructure implemented with good intentions. But every technology that can be used for bad will be used for bad at some point. So when you talk to security and privacy activists, of course, they will say, the only really powerful failsafe way of data protection and privacy protection is by not collecting any data at all - is data avoidance. Once you install CCTV cameras in public space, it's a question of time. First they are going to use it to remove some trash then to highlight some bad parking along the way, of course, always like to find like terrorists, if you can, often they don't turn up anything. And so there's a question of time, because at some point, they need to justify all these costs for very low level returns. And so you're going to widen the mandate for the surveillance.

**Inge** 24:40  

I want to go a anon2726675500 bit back. There were a few things mentioned about this before. And I have to say the reason why this is so important to me is because I work with journalists who are covering these stories, mainly about the problem with smart cities, for example, in China, where a minority is being currently genocide. And the problems with smart cities. I've posted this on the on the forum before as well, a newsletter actually by a by a colleague of mine about his ideal Smart City was always negative because he focused so much on authoritarian regimes using it in a bad way. And he got all these Google alerts about anon1138917760 great Smart Cities are. I think this competition is great to have and needed to have for for us in the West and in the states and hopefully able to push a more ethical and sensible way of using tech. But what can be done about regime said, like you were mentioning right now, Germany itself 100 years ago, and then 50 years ago, use the surveillance state and negative way to suppress people? How should we approach this? And what can be done? I mean, there are companies that are willingly selling their surveillance tech to make smart cities in China. Is there something - what is our role in making sure that can't happen? In your opinion, what should be done?

**Christian** 26:06  

I am at the same time, incredibly optimistic and pessimistic. Let's start with the pessimistic part. The cat is out of the bag, the genie is out of a bottle, we will not be able to go back. But technology is VR. But technology is getting better and better and scarier and scarier, mass surveillance, will be effect, we will not be able to get rid of it with technology, because whenever we built the technology that enhances privacy, someone will build a technology that negates that enhancement, and then as more researchers are coming up with more and more ways to identify people, anon1138917760 they look different biometric things like skin, fanon2855557573rprints, mouth prints, whatever it's getting more and more and more and more. And we probably haven't even scratched the surface yet on anon1138917760 to identify humans with technology. And that's getting more and more, we will have data collection, it's getting easier and easier. If someone wants to spy on us at large scale, they will be able to do so. The only thing that has a chance in hell of stopping that is the social contract. That's the only chance we have. And that's where I'm going to be optimistic. I don't know when we will achieve that. But ideally, I hope and believe that at some point, we will come to terms as humanity as a whole in anon1138917760 we integrate living with this technology. I don't have any idea of anon1138917760 that is going to look. But we have to realize that the concept of privacy we are living in right now, as in, we have separate bedrooms, we will not have sex in front of our children. This is new compared to the whole story of humanity. And not saying this is bad. This is good. But we're having this right now. But a lot of the concepts of what is private and what is not is a social construct that we have arrived at sometimes recently.  

Scandinavia, for example, especially Sweden, has a lot different expectations on anon1138917760 you treat your salary. In Germany talking about your salary is kind of a taboo among colleagues, you don't tell your colleagues what you're making or, allowed to buy contracts - you're not even allowed. In Sweden, for contrast, you can look up anyone's salary on a public internet database. If you know the name of a person in Sweden, you can look up what they make per year. That's a completely different concept. And both have sort of advantages and disadvantages. I’m leaning towards the Sweden model myself, but but on the other hand, I'm German I grew up here. And this you don't - the don't talk about money thing is kind of ingrained in me and we will have to come come to terms with effect. But anyone can find out everything about us online, eventually. And that will have a huge impact on anon1138917760 we will live and anon1138917760 we will treat each other. And in the best possible of roles. This will mean that we will be able to accept each other more that we will be able to forgive things, though not necessarily forget. But actually forgive. Right now we have this ‘you rights to be forgotten’ directive, where if Google know something about your past, which you're embarrassed about, you can tell Google to not sanon1138917760 it in the search result, you have an actual legal rights of that. The next evolutionary step would be that, yes, I have something horrible in my past, but I have overcome it. And even though you know it, you will not hold it against me, because now I'm a different person than 5-10 years ago. I have no idea anon1138917760 we will get there. That is basically the only chance we have as a species. To overcome this, we will have to adapt to living with very invasive technology. And we will have to adapt in a way hopefully, that will make us better, as opposed to just controlling each other and use it as a means of oppression, then we have to protect privacy by social norms.

**Peter** 30:25  

There's a bunch of things like wrapped up there, right? Because, Yes, I think part of it is social norms. Now, we need to have the social norms, and then some hard guaranteed rights, I don't know, if if the UN Human Rights have been set as the baseline or something or something new that comes out of them or something else entirely. But there is a hard thing that you can go to court to, hopefully, if your country supports the rule of law. And then there's the social norm kind of that's like on the smaller change level, not the faster change, before it gets put into law. 

So there's one thing that I think you mentioned, also, your colleague or friend worked a lot with the horrible implementations of smart cities, and in authoritarian regimes, but now he gets all these Google alerts for the great versions. And I think what one question that I personally find really helpful to just ask when you see something like this is working well or not? Well, this is great. Great for whom? And by extension, for whom is it maybe not great? Is it only great for the 25 year old white dudes? Or is it great for the week? Or is it in China as well? And that's where I think you often get two interesting branches off the discussion. And so anon1138917760 can we make this stuff better, of course. I have opinions of what I'd like to see down there. I'd like to see a stronger focus on privacy and other stuff. But I think more importantly, then, what I think should happen is that we have a process in place. And that's where the policy part comes in. A process in place that is participatory, and actually democratic. That makes sure that I'm not the person deciding this because I'm one person and I'm in a historically very dominant, very privileged demographic group, I should not be deciding these things. So I think that's where that participation part is a really important one. We're in smart cities, I don't think we see it as much as say on the local governance.

**Inge** 32:18  

I think the question that needs to be answered in general is, can we make it more inclusive? There’s this Wired video about the problems with AI and facial recognition and anon1138917760 it's super biased and anon1138917760 this is a problem for minorities and gender, gender minorities and ethnic minorities because that they are so much more likely to be miss-recognized, and so they have much more chances of, for example, being questioned by the police or seen as a perpetrator even though they're not. In this video, I think towards the end, it says, the only way to change is if we change the demographics of the AI study group, because it's white males. I don't know the percentage, but it was like 10% is like female and so. So that brings us to a second, I think, question when it comes to ethics and Internet of Things is anon1138917760 do we increase this inclusivity? And anon1138917760 can we make sure that we include all kinds of different groups?

**John** 33:35  

This European Commission project, Next Generation Internet, Internet of Humans is related to the document you participated in, the Vision for a Shared Digital Europe that I don't think it has a formal relationship with this NGO project. Or maybe it does, I don't really know. But it's very similar in what it's going for in describing anon1138917760 society ought to work or it could work. And it has these pillars: cultivate the commons, decentralize infrastructure, enable self determination, and empower public institutions. And then it also call for replacing what it calls “the lens of markets” with these four pillars. But that, to me suggests that capitalism itself as it is currently practice would actually have to change in order for such a thing to come about. Do you agree?

**Peter** 34:31  

I cannot take a lot of credit for it. I love the project. It doesn't have any formal relationships, I think, to anyone but the three lead authors and a few people who, like me gave some input, because it's literally at this point, just a large document online, by activists from you know, the Netherlands and from Poland and a few really esteemed senior colleagues from working with them for a long time who come from an Open Data background and activist governance background. And you're right, that's a big challenge that they're proposing. They're not just that Europe shifts away from seeing everything digital, just as a market, which currently, it does, where all the development stuff is framed as under the banner of the digital single market. And in the European Union, it was like this tiny term in some obscure document that at some point, just slowly started spreading until it became like the lead framing for the policy, the lens that everything to do with the internet is looked at and funded as is all market market market. And they say, hey, that's not bad. But it's also really myopic. It should only be a narrow part of what happens online, the internet is much more than just a marketplace. It's also the commons. It's everyday conversations. It's the tool that empowers this and empowers all the communities essentially, they say, anon1138917760 about the just start advocating for reframing of the internet, within the structure of the European Union, not primarily a market, but primarily a commons, decentralized infrastructure, and powered citizens, and empowered public institutions, the market is still a thing there. But it's a much, much reduced thing. It's not the thing that everything works for, it's the market would work for these other four pillars. And that's a very powerful framing, that I really, really hope, just like this single market, that as a term started spreading from this obscure document across the whole of the European Commission's language, that this may just do a similar thing where it, starts spreading from document to document and at some point, it's what shapes the thinking. And hence, also all the funding the European Union puts to work, which of course is a lot. That's anon1138917760 the European Union makes change happens through some laws and through some funding, right. That's the main mechanisms of influencing change.

**John** 36:56  

You mentioned that you see opportunities here for European companies. And I think that is part of what the commission is looking for with this project, which is why they call it NGI Forward. Because we're all pretty good at describing the problems. And we're pretty good at describing what we want. And the trouble is, as futurist Paul Saffo once said, Never mistake a clear vision for a short path. But I think the opportunity here is to build products that are embedded with these values in what I guess is the hope that people will prefer them.

**Peter** 37:36  

if you look five years ago, there are many reasons why Silicon Valley technology is credibly dominant and solid. So for a long time, it's just been far superior to many other places, or better marketed, whatever the success factors were, but also in the current global way. W on the global market, think about data and anon1138917760 we extract meaning and value from data. They're at a clear advantage because they're much more free to do with their data as they please, as opposed to European companies that have traditionally been through a different kind of data protection laws. And they're maybe not more free and using this data. Then Chinese companies have easier access to the Western world. That's five years ago, right. So fast forward to 2019, we see I think, a dramatically changed global landscape. Because first of all, Chinese companies have gotten so much better at working across the global West and global south, they're much more international and global in their scope, and ambition. So that's one part. Silicon Valley companies, for the first time face significant pushback across all of the world for various different reasons in China because of geopolitics in Europe, because of geopolitics, and privacy violations and data breaches in the States, because they're kind of providing the tools for an election meddling, and all that stuff. So there's a complex mishmash of weirdness going on. But I think it's also very clear that since the GDPR came into effect that comes with significant financial, global fines for certain uses and abuses of data, and all of a sudden, you, you see a much more level playing field for companies that are from Europe, and stick to the national European data protection regulation. And they are not at a disadvantage, because they can't use the data as efficiently. But rather, they just happen to be compliant with one of the most powerful legal blocks in the world, whereas the others may get fined if they follow their own procedures. I have strong opinions on it. And yes data protection, but I also am painfully aware that part of this is like a horrible geopolitical power play in a way that feels really unhealthy To me, it's like, oh, we're also going to leverage local industry at the expense of the others. But to me also, I think, as long as it's based on certain rights I believe in and values I believe in, I'm kind of okay with it, if that makes sense. 

Maybe I shouldn't be. But I really am. I really like data protection to be stronger until we figure out what we want to get out of this. And for the first time, in probably 20 years, European companies are on equal footing in that space, the global players, and one example that I really, really like, it's a fairly small startup out of friends. They're called snip stuff dot AI. And they're like a voice assistant, and voice assistance are, you know, like, the Google Home or I'm an Echo, but their version is fully open source. And it comes with a pre-trained data set. It doesn't share anything back to the company. And for them, it was like a security privacy decision. But by the time the GDPR got implemented, when all the other companies started scrambling, and my phone stopped ringing, because then we were just trying to figure out, anon1138917760 can we make our data-hungry services compliant with that, which, frankly, I didn't have an answer, I could say, you probably can, but for them it's, it's by design, and it's by designed data for that particular law. They were having a big party, because all of a sudden, they get validation, they get a political framework, a policy framework that said, hey, what you're doing is exactly what we want. So you will not have to fear anything, you're good to go. And it gives them a boost. And they were one of these companies that already were trying to do the right thing by their users. And all of a sudden, they got a leg up from the European government in a way that I find really interesting, because of course, all these companies not like an unusual move for every country has policies in place to boost their economies and to boost certain technologies of others and certain markets or others. It's just for the first time that I've seen the European Commission, actually, up in the Parliament get serious and kind of intentional about that, and not just defensive in a way that I found really interesting. I just want to say, yes, I think there is a powerful point of leverage to boost certain values and certain rights on the global stage and incentivize companies to build products based on these values.

**John** 42:03  

One of your big projects, and your Mozilla Fellowship was about your Trust Level tech certification process. For those who don't know, you can go to trusttech.org, where you can apply to get certified answering a long string of questions.  

And even if you don't want to get certified, the questionnaire is so all encompassing, that it's a good map of the landscape. But I found it useful simply to read it. My question now is along the lines of what we were just talking about: have you seen any interest in the Commission or the larger pan-European government in this kind of a certification process, which would be different than Oh, you broke the law? And now we're going to find you, you know, I mean, it would be a kind of a positive step. Are they interested in that?

**Peter** 42:55  

Yes, we designed this question specifically to look at all the aspects of product development which is really what we've been building for a long time, slower than I hoped we would. But we've been building for a long time, an actual design guideline. So by the end, you’re just like automatically there. You don't have to, answer these questions, in hindsight, but these are all questions that aim at anon1138917760 you handle data, anon1138917760 you handle security, anon1138917760 you handle these kind of things in a pretty holistic manner. These are all questions you have to answer one way or another during design process anyway, only some companies I think, don't make it explicit. They just build something. And they've made a decision, but maybe they weren't even aware they're making this decision. So yes, it is like this, just for legal reasons. It's not a certification, because I learned this along the way, certification actually, in the German context at least, is a check if you're compliant with the law. And we , like you indicated, did not want to just say, Are you compliant with the law? We want to say, Are you building products and really respect users privacy and users rights? And do you empower users and give them all the rights you can, or strip them of the rights because you legally can. We wanted to say we didn't want to have the baseline certification of “this is not a horrible product”, we wanted to find and identify and give some external validation and and reach to those products that go above and beyond in respecting user privacy and user rights.  

Have we seen much interest in this? More from the policy side and product side, because it's hard to go back and have Twitter or go to a product that you launched, while you're working on the next level of the next product release cycle, it's hard to go back and then try to map that on your existing products. I hope you'll see interest in the next year, when more companies come out that have been developed based on this, there has been huge interest in the Smart City space to see what of this thinking can be applied to Smart City space, and to other decision making in the public space. I haven't seen that much feedback from the European Commission. To be honest, I've been involved in a lot of products where I'm on all these panels in Brussels. I’m in the right conversations now. Nobody has invited us to see if we can apply this directly in a larger scale on the European level. And that'd be really interesting conversation to have. I'm not sure if that's possible. But I'm sure that our research surfaces enough potential issues and enough possible solutions to make sure that a lot of stuff would get a lot better, certainly a lot more respectful of your rights as a citizen and as a user.

**John** 45:35  

Christian is actively building a product that, as far as I know, very likely would qualify for that certification, which he's building from scratch, or sort of from scratch. Rather than “we have to basically bug fix our product to comply with something” it starts from the premise that, as Christian put it on the Edgeryders site, social media is broken. 

Let's fix it, though, the only way to do that is to make things where the fix is in the core of it; you can't just put a nice suit of clothes on it. A lot of why this stuff comes up is related to social media. Things started to change extremely rapidly when you get smartphones widely adopted. This field of social media has overwhelmed so many things. The point I want to make about that is I see it a anon2726675500 bit related to the climate problem in the sense that there are tangible short term benefits, and the long term problems are not so tangible - until they sanon1138917760 up.

**Christian** 46:47  

the whole GDPR thing that is a perfect example of the social contract at work. And when I said only social contract can rescue us from the horrible internet, GDPR is one of those things in there. Something that is often overlooked is infrastructure. And the internet is infrastructure, social media, up to a point is infrastructure. Infrastructure drives civilization in the most profound ways. I don't know if any of you read David Prince’s book, the Postman, you probably have all watched the movie with Kevin Costner. But basically, it's the story of civilization being restarted through the use of infrastructure, because suddenly there starts to be infrastructure, again, infrastructure for communication. And that bootstraps the whole civilization, again, that puts people in touch with each other, make them realize their very community. And that is what the internet is doing on a much larger scale. And that's the hopeful thing about it. Where we can use that. And if we protect it and see it as that sort of infrastructure, we can really drive forward. And if we build this infrastructure and maintain it with a view to protect minorities, to look at not the voices of those who are white and powerful, but everyone else, and build it in a way that respects everyone's voice, then we can build a truly internet of humans.

**John** 48:36  

We've got the policy issues, we know the problems, or at least some of them, what concretely are we really doing about it, and I'll bring the Chinese back into the picture here because you pointed out when you went to Shenzhen, the Silicon Valley of hardware, at one point you sanon1138917760 a fairly simple, but nice looking anon2726675500 smart lamp. Not really that outstanding, except the thing was made by a class of fifth graders.  

**Peter** 49:20  

Shenzhen is fantastic, an impressive powerhouse in in the way they make technology, this is where essentially, all the factories and all the supply chains globally go from the silica mines in Africa, to the container shipping and packaging that ships this stuff's going on your end to Africa into Southeast Asia. And to a billion people in China. A giant chunk of that stuff is often produced in different versions for like differently priced markets. So hover boards are cheaper in the Philippines, which is why someone who imported the less secure cheaper version to the UK, they started catching fire. There's this aspect where they are the production line essentially for the whole world for electronics, but increasingly also developing and researching new technologies at ever greater speed. And it's a very intentional thing - a big government project. I think it's everything to do with IoT, with making connected stuff there. It has the term Internet Plus, where they just say “we want to be a world leader in AI in electronics and connected devices.” And then they add the resources to it. Not having a strong democratic mechanism behind it, of course, makes it easier to have decentralized efforts, all the drawbacks that brings with it all the horrible drawbacks. But that's why it's possible to say we want to be world leaders. So we're just going to commit x billion a year to train X, Y, or Z number of PhDs in AI research, they're going to be trained by some of the best professors to China and software which are really smart there and developed training, they're also, certainly several hundred thousand or anon1138917760ever many maybe study abroad at the most, prestigious universities, the nationally is really impressive. 

And like you said that small example when we went to this small maker space as a change of pace, essentially to see not just the factories and the r&amp;d departments, but also see the community spaces. We saw the smart lamp looked like a perfectly fine smart lamp. I thought, that looks like something Phillips, might produce or you know, it's it's a fine consumer product. It's really uninspired and boring, has motion detection, it regulates up or down — until the nine year old sanon1138917760ed up who had made it. And I was like, Whoa, okay, that's kind of mind blowing. To me. It's also a generational thing that totally has gotten better and all of this, but still, it's impressive. They had found 3D models, they've modified them then from code, they modified it, they plugged it all together. Is this groundbreaking r&amp;d? No, but when I was like that age, I'm not sure what I did. But it was certainly not designing smart lamps.

**Inge** 52:22  

At a teenagers security surveillance fair in London a month or so ago, a few of the major setups there were actually Chinese companies. So one of the major surveillance companies has all these cameras, and they're insanely good surveillance cameras that are all over China, but they're also sending internationally to smart cities. And some other innovative companies, tech companies from China that are from before would produce, tech that was like sort of a copy of Silicon Valley. But right now they're getting to the stage where they are making actually better things that are still cheaper. And one example is my phone, I have a Xiaomi, anon2298377336 popular right now with the four among us. This is like a $100 Phone. It's a smartphone, and it's insanely good. It's super high quality. And obviously, one of the questions is, again, with me focusing a lot with my work on anon1138917760 I started during regimes that use tech to suppress their populations. That's one of the things we focus on iwith one of the kinds of the people I work with. How do we make sure that the tech that we employ will make our lives better? On one hand I'd like the GDPR conversation we just had to happen in China, but we don't have that. So what can we use?

**Peter** 54:06  

I don't think I have any answers to this. And China has this like big, big public funding initiative called the ‘belt road initiative,’ where they essentially try to like recreate or take the model of the Silk Road into 21st century. It's a thing in Chinese politics to always have these cultural references and have a good name for this stuff. So this is the New Silk Road essentially, is the metaphor they work with. And what it means is a big chain of investments in in countries around the globe and public infrastructure and companies, lots of joint ventures, lots of research partnerships, a enormous scale, I think disproportionately in the global south like Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, but also in Europe and North America, Germany, there's, I think I recently saw a map for journalists had collected all these investments. Germany has, 10 or so and they're like, you know, here's a pilot project on Smart Lighting in a city. Here's a research partnership with the University, it all sounds pretty harmless and benign. And I really, really try to not be overly biased and be very careful in my language. But there is an aspect of this where you see big Chinese part of these investments, usually big Chinese tech companies like Huawei and the others and Tencent investing in local infrastructure and networks and communication networks. And it's tricky if you have a government for a legal regime where there is no hard firewall between these companies and the nondemocratic authoritarian regime. That's, highly, highly problematic if you rely on that with infrastructure, with sensors with data analytics. I'm a anon2726675500 hesitant because again, to me, there are weird colonialist underanon3386180186es there, but it does feel really wrong to just, say, look, can we really allow this or not? In Africa, for example, we see a lot of Chinese companies going in and actually building amazing things for, you know, urban, rural farmers and rural life, there's a bunch of what seems to be benign, good stuff happening there at the speed of the markets that European and American companies will just completely ignore because it's not high margin. On the other hand, we also see giants of infrastructure being put in place. Lagos is one of the Smart City projects for YY. But I imagine all the fast growing like African cities will be at some point, “are you okay with that trade off of like getting like quick Wi Fi everywhere in exchange for massive surveillance?” Or is this like a false choice that nobody should have to make? To me, it feels like, this shouldn't be the choice. But as long as I don't see a better alternative. I'm not sure what to say. It's easy for me to say the pure right thing is better than the compromise thing. But that's easy to say, if you have fast internet.

**Christian** 56:59  

I'm by no means an expert on China. But one thing that I want to give as fruitful for China is undoubtedly cracking down internally as if you're in China, and if you try to be in the opposition or being a dissident, or doing something that is not officially approved, you will live dangerously, and you will have a hard time and it is horrible. And we should work against that. The other thing though, is if for example, China invests in Africa, or generally in the global self, it must not be necessarily a nefarious motive. Because right now, China is gearing up to be a technology provider. Everything China exports and bets that they can export with the good margin, a good profit margin is electronics. Right now, Africa is a huge untapped market for that stuff. If they bring internet to Africa, if they bring technology development fear, they can't they create the market to sell more stuff. And that is probably a large reason why they are doing it. Instead of just “we want to export oppression and correct on software, and spy on people.”

**Inge** 58:16  

I agree with you. And I think what Peter said as well, you know, this, this post-colonial context. Look at us, actually, the people on this call are all nice by Western European and USA. It's a difficult subject matter to discuss. But yes, you are right, or I agree with you to that extent. But there definitely some ways and this is not only China. Especially Africa is very, very vulnerable to being used as a test case or two. As facial recognition, there's is actually just this major scandal that was in Kenya with this French company, de mi Gemma, if I didn't know if I pronounce this correctly, that works with the Kenya government initially, to better their voter database to make a FIFO metric voter database, but their data was sold in the back markets. And so there was this big scandal and then the Kenyan government said, like, Oh, you cannot operate here anymore. But one of the reasons they actually did go to Kenya was because they could test the Kenyan government allowing them to test their technology and gave them a free space to do it, because the African governments are really hungry to to improve. And so if they're given visibility to technologically try out new things and are more eager to do it, and a lot of other countries besides France or China would, because of their already disadvantaged position. But they, you know, there was this other big scandal, and I don't know where it was, I don't think it was Kenya, where he said area where they work with Chinese companies to make these smart cities and all the facial recognition data is being sent back to China for their databases. The point is that these people, the people that are participating in this, don't realize that.  

And again, we've come to the social contract, right? You don't realize that their own personal data is being given to a foreign government, which doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. But because there are already countries that are at a certain disadvantage, they're more eager and willing and open to accept certain things without further thought, or, understanding of what the consequences might be, especially for their population. So I do think this isn't this is an important thing. And again, it's not just China, it's it's like I said, this French company, as well, that the global sales in general is more more vulnerable to this than we are.

**Peter** 1:00:50  

I couldn't agree more. These are, really important points. Yes, there's more need and more hunger to, to not turn opportunities down, just because they have a risk attached to them. I think when we talk to government officials, especially on the city level, like in Europe and the US where they're not necessarily in the same situation of need, but they're seeing, they have such a perception that they need to be seen as innovation friendly, that they also don’t want to turn stuff down just because it would seem as anti-tech, anti-innovation. And they're facing a lot of trouble. And it's not like the smaller cities have like a big staff that has the capacity to analyze these impacts, really like a new big city does. And maybe San Francisco does. But Austin maybe already doesn't. And Austin is like a fairly big pro-Tech City. And so that's interesting, but also what what John raised at the beginning of the call, if this stuff gets shared back to a government that might possibly abuse it, that's already bad enough by many counts, where, for example, like Geneva Conventions do not just forbid torture, they're also forbid the threat of torture, because even if you don't torture, if you expect that you might be tortured, that already changes your behavior. Not that it's the same thing. But the same dynamic applies, I think, where if you know it could be abused and shared back it already has an impact on your life. The bizarre thing of all of this is, that maybe some of these data sets are much more diverse than those of the restaurant companies, which is partially why the New York City Police is trial trailing out the facial recognition software by a Chinese company, that's much better at recognizing darker skin faces. I don't have a strong point here, except that there's a lot of like weird things going on when we discuss these things, because it touches all parts of all our lives.

**John** 1:02:55  

I was reading in some of your material, where you were talking about neural networks, and anon1138917760 AI comes into play in all of this, because they're so profoundly different in the way that they go about gathering and out putting whatever their result is. And the point was made that neural network can output a result and you don't know anon1138917760 it got there. You may or may not know, even the people who made it don't always know anon1138917760 they got there.  

You sanon1138917760ed this anon2726675500 video of all these anon2726675500 robots in a warehouse, doing a much more efficient better job of putting stuff where it belongs, and anon1138917760 that's gonna be the way it goes. And for that kind of thing, it’s “well, I'm sorry, you don't have your job driving a forklift truck now, because robots are doing it.” And that's one kind of too bad. 

But what about when you get this kind of black box activity going on in a situation where you need to find out anon1138917760 you got there. That was why I was thinking of elections when I read that. How did we get here? I was thinking about the intersection of IoT and AI. Do you guys have any comments about that? How things move from IoT, which is reasonably understandable at least to me, with anon2726675500 sensors doing things feeding information to some central unit? It's not really that black of a box, if you want to look into it, but it is different when you're talking about people who make these things who don't even know anon1138917760 they got to the answer.

**Peter** 1:04:30  

right, and what went into like, shaping things’ decisions, right? There's these things start as a thing where you test them for some results, and they sanon1138917760 good results. And so, you know what, it's good enough. But you'd have a human in the loop. And at some point, the human in the loop seems to not add a lot of value. And so you cancel that line item in the budget. And all of a sudden, you don't have a level of recourse or someone to understand anon1138917760 these things happen. And we see this in a certain level of transparency in the way that insurance premiums are calculated. We see it to some degree in the way that policing algorithms work. Most of these stories are fairly horrible. I guess we only read about the ones that are fairly horrible. But if you can really interrogate the way that decisions are made, if you don't, we don't need to know all the the exact. The exact recipe is one metaphor, everyone's heard that I kind of like, we do need to know which ingredients go into the decision making. So we can at least get to some level of accountability. We don't need to necessarily understand exactly anon1138917760 it works. But we need to have tools built in and methods to interrogate if the results are correct, we need to if we are using AI to do any decision of importance, and we make it mandatory to use AI for that.

**Christian** 1:05:54  

If the person who gets potentially affected cannot opt out of the AI, then I need to be able to understand the process in all of its forgiveness. Because if I'm not able to understand that this is a nightmare scenario, and it's really important that AI only gets implemented in ways where people can look after this. Part of the reason why Germany is still so much on the paper votes is that is something that every person with a minimal amount of training can actually understand anon1138917760 the votes are being counted. If there is a machine, then you will suddenly need special knowledge and special training to understand what is happening and to be able to check on it. And that's the same thing with AI systems. If an AI system that makes a decision, I need to be able to understand anon1138917760 video a vi system came to the decision. So in order to make a meaningful appeal to it, if it's necessary, or to understand one of my behavior or my things or my surroundings, factor into that decision. If that doesn't happen, it’s basically the same as if the king just say kill that person. And I just have to deal with that. That's the same result from the citizens perspective. And that really means AI must be made in a way that is transparent. Also to uncover any hidden bias that is created in the AI when it's being built, where we end up with systems that don't see black people.

**Peter** 1:07:33  

I think that is a really good point. I think in the meantime, we just need to also make sure that there is a level of a method for records built in. This is something that's an aspirational goal, but I'm not sure it can ever be fully reached. But in the meantime, which might be forever, we just need to make sure that if something smells fishy or something goes wrong, there is a method to address that and get someone to look into it, preferably a human. I know Institute's annual report, they have all these examples of say, you know, health insurance in the States, changing the rules for like, who gets what level of care at home with like certain disabilities, and anon1138917760 the rules change. And all of a sudden someone gets lowered from getting like a full-time care person to a 20% care person, which might not be enough to get through your day, in a dignified way. And if there's nobody to understand anon1138917760 the process ends up there, then you in deep trouble because you have no level of recourse that says something that happens because this is always like a force not applied in a vacuum. But it's applied in like horrible, commercialized, cost saving contexts where all the safeguards will be stripped off to make to increase the profit margin. And that's where things go really wrong.

**Christian** 1:09:02  

It's even worse, the thing is VIP process costs time. And depending on who or where you are, in which circumstances you are, for example, you get a parking ticket, you could just pay it and when it's when it's over. Or you could say I don't want to pay, I handed it over to my lawyer. That implies that you have a lawyer and you're willing to take the risk. But if it's somebody for whom it is going to cost more with that lawyer, that implies a whole different level of wealth so they just pay for the parking ticket, because the risk of having that escalate into something bad, right? They won't do. Now imagine VA is handing off the parking ticket because it's an AI, it's a computer thing, it's suddenly at a much larger scale. That's the thing with everything where humans are involved, that puts a limit on anon1138917760 often this happens. Because that takes time. And if you want to scale it up, you need some way more humans for this. So it's not happening at that large scale. If it's a computer, you can have it 1000 times per second, and it doesn't cost you much more. So suddenly, VAI would give our parking tickets way more often. And then, to stay in this example, which is slowly getting more unlikely you would have poor people bombarded with target parking tickets, they cannot fight having VAIV, and just saying “in case you do not like for result Call this number” is not enough.

**Peter** 1:10:34  

Again, we need like a fair playing field for all artists. We need transparency and all that. I think it's not a coincidence that s one of the organizations that is most urgently researching transparent AI is DARPA and the US military research agency, because they say look, we do need algorithmic assistance in the way we handle our weapons systems. But we also really need to understand anon1138917760 exactly they come to their conclusions. For example, an AI- based visual recognition of incoming fighter planes is much faster and more reliable than human eyes at a certain distance. Because you can't even see, you can resolve what's going on, when they already recognize the movement patterns as drones or rockets or planes. But before you shoot at anything you need to really know that you are shooting at the right thing. And you can cue all the examples of where that went wrong with like human or no human in the loop. Of course, there's more than enough examples of that. But I was at a conference listening to a military person, at a fairly high ranking University, describing in great detail anon1138917760 they're super afraid of introducing too much AI into the process, because the risk of escalation and wrong decisions is so high if you just go to the point where you say a green light or red light for shoot inga gun sanon1138917760s that you really need to know is this reliable or not. And CN system always having a human and never have fully automated systems on that level, which gives me a shred of hope at least.

**John** 1:12:08  

Either you or somebody you were quoting was describing anon1138917760 in chess, the computer beats the human but when a computer and a human team up, they always beat the computer by itself.

**Peter** 1:12:22  

Yes, like the Center Chess model. That goes back to the Engelbart focus on augmentation over automation. I think that's where it gets really interesting: when you don't just replace humans by automating them away. But you give them superpowers, the way that all of technology does, it’s like going back to a knife where the knife helps us to cut things that we couldn't slice them with our hands, these tools enhance our capabilities. And that's I think, where things get really interesting and where I'd like to see things going where we augments the skills of of humans rather than automate them away.

**John** 1:13:00  

Thank you so much, Peter. It is an honor to have you with us. Christian, the same with you. And always a pleasure, Inge.

**Peter** 1:13:10  

Thank you so much for having me."

Hi, my name is Michelle Thorne, and I work for the Mozilla Foundation. We're behind the browser Firefox. And for the last few years, we've been working on internet health.

Peter  0:11  
Thank you. Thanks so much for making the time. So we want to have this conversation as part of Edgeryders Internet of Humans project. And I just wanted to explore a anon2726675500 bit with you, in your words, anon1138917760 you tackle these value driven digital projects? What is it you actually work on? What are the challenges, but maybe that started with anon1138917760 did you get involved involved with this and what you're excited about these days?

Michelle   
I got first gotten interested in all things internet about 15 years ago.

  
And I was actually a very passionate early Wikipedia when the project was just getting started. And I remember telling everybody I knew like my university professors, ""there's this amazing website that lets you edit all these these different articles. And it's all the world's knowledge and all the world's languages."" And I just thought that was the most ambitious and coolest thing on the internet. And so that was kind of my window into free culture and open source. After going to the first week of <mania?> in Frankfurt, Germany, I learned about Creative Commons, where I later worked. And after being at Creative Commons for a few years, started to work at the Mozilla Foundation. So the idea of, you know, open, participatory, global, ambitious digital projects has always been the big job for me.

Peter  1:44  
Okay, so participation, I think that's a really important part. How do we put users or people like you into that scenario first? And anon1138917760 do we empower them? And anon1138917760 does that play a role in your your more recent work?  

Michelle  2:05  
I'm really interested in the internet, and the role it plays in society. I see it as a global public resource, and something really worthy of attention and care. I think one of the challenges we see today is that participation is more complicated than it was, let's say, in the earlier days of the internet, we've seen the rise of these big centralized platforms, which use their corporate policies to control anon1138917760 you participate. There is very anon2726675500 governance from the user side, and anon1138917760 those platforms might change or respond to people's needs. And we're also seeing the rise of behaviors online, hate speech and other kinds of violence aggravating actions that have kind of put people into retreat, or help to polarize people. So we have other social media platforms who really benefit from benefit from outrage and benefit from content that gets, quote, engagement. But it's actually creating a kind of polarized atmosphere online, and people are retreating and participating less, or just participating in their smaller groups and just talking about the average. So it's become a kind of, at least in my experience, and what I've heard anecdotally and seen in some studies, just the internet as a place of participation is a lot more money, the Muslim foundation on on the team that I'm on, we support all sorts of leaders in the internet health movement, who are tackling these different kinds of issues. So there's a whole group of people, Camille included, who are talking about misinformation, and anon1138917760 do you combat the rise of misinformation online? People talking about anon1138917760 do we talk about hate speech and radicalized speech online. And we also run a bunch of campaigns around these topics that I've been working on the last few years is the Internet of Things, and anon1138917760 to make it more responsible, more open, more private, and also include these ideas of participation and co-creation, because the Internet of Things has typically been a lot of black box appliances, without a lot of in a real agency to change them.

Peter  4:17  
You just touched on something that I personally find really interesting, because as you know, I also work a lot around IoT. And Internet of Things is one of these awkward fields that doesn't have really clear bounds. But you touched on one of the inherent issues there, like you met just mentioned, openness and privacy, and as a term, anon1138917760 do you resolve that? Or anon1138917760 do you think about this tension?

Michelle  4:40  
The IoT projects, I think, get it right or on the right path are ones that are open in their designs and their code and in their explanation of their business model and around like, anon1138917760 anon1138917760 the thing works, and also anon1138917760 did this thing comes to be in terms of supply chain, and in terms of the materials and things that go into it, as well as the third parties that work with it. So there's a whole, for me, openness is starting to become a much broader, you know, includes many things are, you know, transparency and anon1138917760 that device is made. What that device interacts with, in addition to the licensing of a name, it's like codes. And I think that those practices help to build trust. Because when you can see that an audit that information you can better understand is this a service or product that I'm willing to trust. And I think part of what that openness is about is around disclosing what happens with your data, what partners that company is in contact with or, partnering with, what their IT security update policies are, these are all things that help you make an informed decision whether you will trust this device with your data, and therefore, consider it a privacy worth preserving.

Peter  6:03  
You talk about privacy and data protection and the right to your own privacy. I've recently read a few really interesting points that I have to admit I hadn't anon2298377336 realized that they had to put it so eloquently around individuals, the role of individuals versus collective rights. So we have a corporations that <to bear thing?>. We have lawmakers to kind of provide a framework for that. But a lot of the rhetoric, especially on Silicon Valley, and even a lot of the activist groups is the individual needs protect their own right? What do you think about that?

Michelle  6:44  
I think in general, we put too much pressure on the individual to have to protect themselves and all sorts of areas of our lives, technology, internet, it's just one of them. I do think there are responsibilities of governments and corporations. And I think we're seeing the rise of, thanks to digital tools, some sort of collective agency and collective bargaining. So pools of users able to put together their demands, their needs, their permissions, and through more collective bargaining, able to negotiate. And so I think that for me, that's a kind of a new area worthy of more exploration and others that some people may be sitting in this network are looking at things like digital cooperatives. And I think that that's going to be a really interesting place. Because Yeah, I think, only putting the burden on the individual to have to understand all these different policies, all the different permissions, all the different technical capabilities. And do this in like the seconds of free time they have between their otherwise strapped lives is unfair, and not a society I want to advocate for.

Peter  7:50  
I couldn't agree more. And also, it's like, as an individual, even if miraculously. And this should not be a crime in Canada, possible zero crime, but even if you will be able to read and fully understand and fully navigate all the privacy policies in the world, a lot of the magic of data exploitation still happens once the data is your individual data is collected with like data of like 150,000, or like 100 or 2 million other people. And none of the privacy policies even tagged with that level at all. That's like the Wild West. Completely. Interesting. 

So you started from the free culture was your gateway drug and open source that led you to Creative Commons, where you helped open up licenses and copyright, to give creators more power, rather than the copyright regime? That led you to do the foundation? And where you've been digging into into internet health? And user empowerment? What are some of the tools in the toolkit? What were some of the tools you've been using? I know, there's a PhD program. That's just kicking off. There was a thing called the almighty studio, which was like an internal program. Can you just give a brief overview of like, your personal journey there?

Michelle 9:14  
I started the Mozilla Foundation, when Mark Simon, the executive director, had also just recently joined. And he had the ambition to take the Mozilla Foundation, which was pretty strongly just focused on Firefox, the browser, and maybe a anon2726675500 bit the web as a platform, and said, like, we need to be fueling a movement for the help of the internet. And so his application blog post is called A Million Brazilians. And at the time, that was a anon2298377336 radical and ambitious proposal to the organization. And so I've been working with him for over a decade, and the things that I have done and have helped to make that vision a reality. Little bit, these projects started off with what's called the Mozilla Festival. And the idea was, let's bring together these different, primarily open players in the open space. So we had people from open hardware, open science, open education. And we had Wikipedia there, you know, we had a collection of project open video, there was a smattering of these open efforts around the world. And we thought let's bring them together. And here's a look at also learn from all these different movements that we're applying openness to other fields. So that's where you build your rainbow coalition, so to speak. Okay. And that helps give
us specific projects and people that we could be investing in and supporting over the years. And what's interesting is even over a decade that's had for various permutations, but a lot of the key ideas still continue. So I still think I still use convenience as this really important way to bring together a coalition, a network of people who might otherwise not work together, to really create, like, a new community of practice out of these diverse groups. And by working on specific and achievable projects, you are able to actually give people like a collaborative substrate that lets something move forward. So I think that those some of those templates that still continue. And I have definitely learned over the years, but I think those are are anon2298377336 powerful tools, especially in the nonprofit space.

Peter  11:26  
So that's communities of practice.  Individually walk us through the learning curve of the Open IT Studio and anon1138917760 that led to open dot and set the stage for the next chapters.

Michelle 11:41  
One theme that kind of emerged through that work of the years, which also include included web literacy, and being part of the kind of learn to code movement was this idea of before the first falling at the Physical Web. 

Depending on circle you're in, you would sometimes say different words to what we set out on IoT, because that started just to be the term that was getting more traction. But anyways, I partnered with a professor from the University of Dundee, Jon Rogers, who I had worked with for many years through the Mozilla festival, we just really got along and just said, like, hey, every time we talk, there's all sorts of ideas and things that we can be working on. So let's just Skype with each other once a week, and see where it goes. And so for a few months, you know, he came from a design research background, really interested in the physical aspects of the web and of interaction as an electrical engineer. I was coming from this digital rights, free culture, participatory open perspective. And so we would just mash together ideas. And then it emerged, we could actually make some sort of program that could be hosted with Mozilla and the University of DD, that tried to take those different values and approaches and apply to Internet of Things. Say we started the Open IT Studio in 2016, with the idea of, let's support a community of practice of designers, technologists, philosophers, historians, digital rights advocates, to talk about what can we do to make it a healthier space for humans. And I think that project was anon2298377336 successful, definitely a highlight of my career, there were a few things that came out of it that might be interesting for people to check out. One I can recommend is the Anatomy of AI, which is a collaboration between <blood and jeweler from Sherry labs, and Kate Crawford from AI now?>

 
And they took an Amazon Alexa. And they said, let's do a truly exploded view. So in design, you have this thing called exploded me, which usually just sanon1138917760s you the physical parts that go into device. But we said with connected devices, the story is much bigger than just the small material parts that go into it. So <what I'm?> created the most amazing map, it's four meters by four meters, which was exhibited at the V and A Museum in London and has toured around Europe and beyond. And it's sanon1138917760s you the lifecycle of an Amazon Alexa from the mining and the smelting and the production of the components to then when it's actually running all of the data centers and content moderation advertising to the end of life, recycling, and others and otherwise discarding of the device and what is the true cost of Amazon Alexa; what really goes into it. And I think that for me, that project, The Anatomy of AI, is such a great touchsanon3386180186e for when we think about IoT. Often we talk about IoT, we just see a smart light bulb, or we often just see an object, you know, some sort of traffic light or something. But it's really the new vast network of stuff before, during and after that device where things get really interesting. So I think that that for me was just such a great example of bringing that to life.

Unknown Speaker  15:14  
The victory really, really important point to highlight there, I think we're like to really think about the analyzer the hidden costs. Because Yeah, if you see this device, it's like, yeah, okay, here's a device it costs x. But of course, that's  a fraction of of the story. Really. It's just the last three minutes of a long, long saga.  I mean, I guess it's true for most products, but a connected product with chips built in. And also like a IM and cloud infrastructure, it's a very tied into these larger hidden infrastructures.

Michelle  15:52  
And I think it's not even just the last minutes, it's actually the beginning of a whole new day, a whole new 24 hours, because so for example, Amazon Alexa, it's sold incredibly cheaply. I mean, compact, like it's very inexpensive device. But some of the main things it's doing is it's becoming a much more direct portal for people to order things from Amazon. But probably more importantly, it's become a whole voice snippet, like gathering system, which is powering Amazon's Alexa, that is probably the true value of having your Alexa in everyone's home. For me it like that with working with Open IT Studio and with Jon, and with our collaborators or whichever one Peter, this kind of growing conversation amongst technologists, different professionals in the tech sector around anon1138917760 do we make the internet especially these newer emerging technologies within associated with Internet? How do we make them more understandable? How do we make decisions that lead to these products being more responsible, or the people making them be more responsible? So I think some of it is about transparency and understanding. So things like this map. And some of it are tools, like one project that we worked on together the TrustMark, the trust mark for IoT, which is something that you can then use as a tool for vetting whether your product needs a certain standard and hoping to be giving users some agency and figuring out like, is this something that I really want to have in my home or my life?

Peter 17:25  
So would you say, if anyone who would be the main audience for for these, these products you're mentioning, because you mentioned on the one hand, you really want to empower users and give them the tools to make better decisions. On the other hand, we discussed this tension, anon1138917760 individuals can only do so much when they are faced with giant global infrastructures and systems. Did you have like a specific audience in mind? And you're thinking: does it depend on a project? How do you think about these things?

Michelle  18:00  
I think the place where we have the most effect, maybe some better leverage, is working with other professionals and practitioners. Because those are, that's an audience. That's kind of a more notable in size and scale, or size, and just and profile. And those are people who are making daily decisions in their lives that go into those products. So those were our key audiences. So working with Jon: he's teaching next generation product designers. So we had a whole thing around education, from undergraduate to graduate. And now we have a PhD program funded by the U looking at responsible IoT, I think this idea of what are we doing in the higher education space to train people going into the field that will have these kinds of considerations, as well as people who are in the field who are making kind of daily decisions, and then also all sorts of kind of user advocates. So we work with Consumer Reports, we work with nonprofits, we work in the digital rights space, all these people were kind of advocating on behalf of users. And they love these kinds of examples and tools, because it helps them give point to something maybe a anon2726675500 more tangible or intuitive than just a policy briefing.

Peter  19:19  
Policy. I wonder if what you're describing sanon1138917760s that there's there might be a generation of product designers coming up that understand these issues much, much better. And now I wonder if the same is happening in the political science schools and the law schools? What is the status there? <Or if you're lagging behind if they've already like TechStars completely differently. And underwear?>

Michelle  19:45  
It's a great question. I was recently reflecting with a friend of mine that when in college, I studied critical social thought. And we did a lot of thinking and writing, but very anon2726675500 making. And if I could recreate my degree I would have critical social and critical making as my double major. Because I think you're right, I think actually the, let's say the makers, I think we're seeing this in the computer science departments and the design departments, engineering departments of all kinds are getting a lot more ethics curriculum and support to think about the ethical components of their work. I think that's on the rise. It's on the rise, but I think some of the other humanities actually don't do enough making of their own. So I'm sure when you're studying law, you would very, very few project would actually encourage you to do anything like make a trust, like a prototype, just mark that actually tries to put some of your law practice into something more tangible. And I I'm a firm believer that we learn through making and even though I'm not a skilled maker, I think that this is a an amazing process to try to turn ideas into something tangible, something that's testable, something that lives in another mode.

Peter  21:01  
What are the kinds of reactions you get when you start talking to other people about these super complex technical issues because things kind of work in our nonprofit like, that's, that's something that I sometimes find a bit of a struggle when you're so steeped in that thinking, and then you are someone who you've learned from, but I can also learn from from the work you've been doing there. But they have not been sitting there thinking the same way, because they do their own thing. And then all of a sudden, you're like, Oh, well, anon1138917760 do I first of all wrap my head around all the stuff you've been doing to see anon1138917760 this applies? But also, anon1138917760 can I distill this? And not scare anyone away and have them put their head in the sand?  Because there's such a big brain dump. And the issues are so overwhelmingly big, it's like a weird scale and fuzzy around the edges. Does that make sense?  

Michelle 22:00  
We exhibited at the V and A during digital design weekend, and you get, like 25,000 people come through, and check out our work. And you have to talk to all sorts of people from all walks of life. And so yes, a lot of it's contextual, but who you're in front of. But I find in general, many people have a smartphone, most smartphones have some sort of voice assistant running on them. I think a smartphone is one of people's first IoT devices in this way. And so actually talking to people about their phone, anon1138917760 do they use their phone and the user voice assistant? What do they think about that? Do they know where that data is going? What do they think about those companies have it, it's all those funny stories around? Accent accents being misunderstood, like the Scottish person trying to talk to Siri, in these people really relate to those stories, and have their own experiences with them. And that becomes kind of a channel through which you can talk about some of these other internet health issues.

Peter  23:02  
That's right. That's especially true for, say, a general audience. But you mentioned that you mostly target in your practice, practitioners. Are they open for these kind of arguments? Or is this a thing that a shrug off as a Yeah, yeah, security, privacy. 

Michelle  23:25  
I'm seeing increasingly people who don't want their work to be adding to the shadiness in the world. <What but not everyone?> just released a really great study around tech workers and their attitudes, was focused on the UK, but they sanon1138917760ed that I think one in five tech workers, is ready to leave a job if the employers makes an error, like an unethical decision, which cost the company like 30,000 times. So I think this is anecdotally and then also in the sector, more people want to have ethical decisions in what they build. And so I'm actually finding more people, who you don't have to convince them that these are things to work on. It's more that was more anon1138917760 oftentimes, you'll find that people are people who work in the tech sector are coming up against the business of the company is the thing that is at odds, it may be not their product manager or their design team, everyone's on board. But you have you coming down to some bigger question around like, anon1138917760 is that company financed? And so I think some of the big innovations of the coming decade will actually be around reforming our economic models.

Peter  24:38  
So I think we had, like I said, as a really solid basis for you know, like, if like, have companies like a fantastic group, doing a lot of like research, you've like increased transparency, and started building tools and mechanisms to empower people. And I think we're like breaking, kind of like new ground, like in a fairly literal literal like knowledge, workI kind of sense. And that you're now involved in where you you co founded a PhD program. And PhD programs are, of course about like, contributing absolutely new research and knowledge and really expanding the field in a way that hadn't been before. Right. So can you talk a anon2726675500 bit about this? And we'll also hear more about this from john Rogers, two partners, but like, anon1138917760 do you get involved with this? How does this come together? And where do you see this going? 

Michelle 25:27  
I think of anon1138917760 this project came to life. And thanks to the maintenance of the European Commission to prioritize these kinds of training networks, which seems to be a unique thing in the world that they say we need to get universities and in the industry together to think and to move forward to these new kinds of trainings. And especially they were interested in things like a nonprofit like Mozilla, who really focus on these more societal implications of technology. So I think that's a really amazing that they even have this kind of like structure. So it's going to be a three year PhD program that actually the there's five PhD students who are at this moment moving to Dundee, Scotland to start next week. And they come, they come from all over the world. And the idea is that they're going to be researching, through design practices, their philosophical practices through coding practices, and legal practices, ways to advance a healthier Internet of Things. So what that will look like in practice is like, very much going to be determined on what they bring to it. But we focused on different layers of where we see it playing out from the body, to the home to the neighborhood, in the city. And then we also did a cross cutting project or on the checkmark, and helps to try to bring those ideas together. So I'm anon2298377336 excited to see what it's like, I think, to have a PG program paired with a nonprofit is exciting, they're going to also come to facility Berlin, for a year and a half to be more embedded in our office here. And then they're being advised by an array of really amazing organizations who are at the forefront of this responsible space, moving things on, simply secure.  I want to take this program, as much as I want to run it.

Peter  27:25  
I think it's really neat that you're able to get the kind of supervisor support from people who are doing this kind of tech advocacy, also.
 
So that kind of opens up the space beyond like pure IoT into activism into academia, but also, one of the themes that that I've seen throughout this is thinking about Commons, versus just exploitation, about sustainability, in terms of  short term gains. And I think recently, you've talked more openly and more and more today, about a greener web and more sustainability in terms of the digital services and the web infrastructure we use. Where was your thinking of this?

Michelle 28:12  
The stat that really set me back was learning that the internet contributes 2% of the world's global carbon emissions, which basically puts it on par with the airline industry. I think for a long time, we've lived in some sort of digital denial that the internet is physical, in that sense, in the sense that it requires environmental resources and adds to pollution. But as in the tech sector, we've never shied away from imagining different futures and innovating. So it's actually a place where I think the internet both is a heavy contributor to emissions, as well as it can be an amazing tool to reduce its own as well as used to mobilize and organize for climate action.
 
Recently, I've been really interested in the idea of becoming carbon neutral Internet, and what it would take to reduce those emissions. The great news is that there are many wonderful humans of the internet who are interested in this in this problem as well. And there's already like an array of actions that are happening from moving data centers to renewables, to designing websites and web services that have a lower footprint, to extending the life of connected devices, there's a whole bunch of things people are doing that in aggregate can actually reduce emissions. And so for me, that's really exciting, not just thinking about it in the internet sector, but also just seeing the mobilization around a climate agenda. We see that really strongly here in Germany with Friday's for future, and the recent European elections, this I think, strong mandate from the public to do something about it. And I've really taken that kind of momentum to heart. 

Within Mozilla, we started a small group of people who are pushing for more climate activism within the organization, which you can expect to hear more from soon. And just being more involved and also learning. There's a lot to learn about, about the climate crisis. But I think it's something that now when I think about  what does it mean to be responsible technologists, I think previously, I really saw it as being around openness and privacy, inclusion, and all these topics. But now I'm increasingly seeing it has to also include the climate and kind of moving up or probably down the stack really deeper into the base layers. I keep putting like penthouses on it, but actually basement that needed investigation. People that I've spoken to have felt this kind of dissonance between amazing internet future that, for example, that me and all these open movement people have been advocating for, and the hard reality of the climate crisis, but I think there's a way to actually address that dissonance head on and not be paralyzed in action, but actually to do something about it. That's, that's where I'm at at the moment.

Peter  31:12  
That's really interesting that you've hinted at this, but it's, I think, a really, really important reminder that oftentimes, if you want to put people first, it means that you need to work throughout all the conditions so that people just come first. So in this case you need data and design practices to put people in the center, you need to make sure that there's a planetary perspective in order to, for the people to have a chance to be front and center. So that's really interesting to see anon1138917760 there's this big red thread that connects them all. And the thing is, it's very illustrative of, of the tech industry in the tech scene over the last 10 years, from kind of utopian activists, as soon as we can, like, digitize and everything will be better, automatically to have, okay, there's actually there's complications once it hits a certain scale, and more people come in and all that stuff, and the dynamics change, and now we need to remedy some of the potential problems, too. Oh, now we really need to dig in and, and see if we are contributing to a problem because it's such a dominant force of power. 

Now. I think we could wrap up, is there anything I should have asked anything you'd like to add any anything, any shout outs you want to give?

Michelle  32:36  
I mean, just think about this project being in the context of the European Union. In much of my work over the years, I've really seen the European Union be this kind of beacon of hope, from be it from a regulatory perspective, be it from an agenda setting perspective be addressed from like a celebration of multiculturalism will do lingual ism. And now, also putting the climate high on the high on the priority list. Even as a non US citizen, I really believe in the project of the EU. And  I think it's one of the most modern and exciting things that is happening on the planet, I think for the EU to really be invested in a thought leader around what the internet could be and helping to create this kind of alternative vision for it that are dominated by the prevailing centralized service capitalism models. I think, you know, that hasn't made me more public, public good perspective. I think there's something I really am hopeful for and to help lead. So that's exciting. And one of the reasons I was excited to participate in this project.

Peter  33:45  
Awesome. Well, thank you so much for making the time."

I think the EC would love nothing more than to have a (European) human-centered internet service win in the marketplace.  But realistically, is that possible?

So where are the really innovative projects?  I think ultimately this is what the EC wants to get out of this set of discussions they are funding here...for some real innovators to come out of the woodwork or out from under rocks where the EC has not been looking, with ideas that will lead to European business that embody human-centered values, but win in the marketplace.

In my opinion, its good for the festival if ""outside"" people can know exactly anon1138917760 to signup for the explicit events. As an organizers, we would need to know anon1138917760 many participants has signed for ""a"" particular event - for planning food etc.

* scope of the rules (what ‘AI’ systems should be covered, only top consumer/citizen-facing applications, or other/underlying infrastructure)
* type of obligations (only transparency/documentation requirements?, what should they contain?)
* How to differentiate, depending on scale (i.e. me building system affecting 10 people vs FB unleashing a new content ranking algorithm on a quarter of world population) and risk (system to distinguish which cat video I will be sanon1138917760n vs. decisions on employment, insurance, housing, predictive policing).


So we want to gather/build a number of case studies where specific technological choices have resulted in increasing or decreasing justice.

Some examples include:

* AlgorithmWatch produces yearly reports looking at automated decision-making in Europe (Jan 2019 report, ‘Automating Society - Taking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU’). 

* UK Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation is also carrying out a review of positive and negative effects of automated decision-making, first interim results just out.

* Interesting examples could be insurance branch, or the case of Austrian labour authority using it to decide whom of the unemployed to help in finding a new job (criterion: efficiency narrowly defined, i.e. those already have highest chance to find a new job in the first place…).

I hope you are all well and having creative and innovative weekends :) 

I am the co-founder of COACT Lab an open-source environmental tech incubator based in the green hills outside of Barcelona. 

We have developed an online presentation that gives you more details about the program which you can view [here.](https://tristan.pageflow.io/coact-lab#218774)

COACT Lab is an incubator, where inventors, designers and technologists with environmental tech ideas can disconnect from their daily pressures to focus on creating scalable and usable solutions. 

This will be done over short term residences as well as 3-6 month rigorous incubator programs, where experts will come to the campus to inform and coach the participants in various fields as they build their tech. 

COACT Lab is set in the Valldaura Labs ([valldaura.net](http://valldaura.net/)), which is a fully equipped 'Fab Lab' located on the hills outside of Barcelona, twenty minutes from the city. 

While the lab has all the latest machinery and design software, there is also a farm producing food for the residents, a woodlab for carpentry for 'low tech' solutions, and it is in the middle of 130 hectares of forest. 

Surrounded by nature, living in a self-sufficient existence, we believe that this is the ideal setting to inspire our participants to break the boundaries of environmental tech solutions.

It would be great to get the community's feedback on the project and get as many Edge Ryders involved as possible.

We look forward to hear from you,

William"

great to have you here! sounds very interesting! looking forward to seeing more of this collaboration :).

A great way to get some direct feedback and reaction would also be during the Edgeryders Festival in November! We are already planning workshops on the topics of open source, community management, proposal writing for infotech solutions and sustainable technology. It sounds as if there could be a lot of interesting overlapping and maybe you could either feature or add your event to this roster?

The deadline for preliminary proposals by filling out [this form](https://ernordic.typeform.com/to/T5psAI) is on the 20th, and Tuesday the 17th of September we will meet for a community call to talk some more details and discuss some ideas :). Would be great if you would join :)!

Anyway, I'm curious if some of the open tech solutions you guys are workign on (like carpentry based) go as far as looking at green building construction from the bottom up - including foundation, walls, energy grids and so on.  Some of us in Brussels are looking for a large residential building to transform it into a carbon free one [(The Reef)](https://edgeryders.eu/c/earthos/the-reef). Part is technical solutions, and another aspect of greening are lifestyle tweaks (growing your own food).

I have a question, and my apologies if it sounds a bit thorny. I have the impression that a lot of the innovation really worth doing tends to *destroy* GDP, not increase it, and in general to be bad for capitalism (not to put too fine a point on it). Environmental innovation is not the only type of innovation where I see this, but it is where this effect seems strongest. I write this under the influence of the [Deep Adaptation paper](/t/10726), where Bendell essentially says  that sustainability is over. We are now in the age of adaptation, and the three directions of work for adaptation are resilience, relinquishment and restoration. Relinquishment is particularly important: maybe the most impactful environmental innovation is going to come from *giving up* stuff (private cars, commercial aviation, most meat). 

*Not buying things* is infinitely scalable, but it generates economic benefit from public goods (like the natural environment) instead of market transactions. Public goods are famously difficult to monetize, which adds further efficiency because just letting people enjoy them is very cheap and (again) scalable, but, in my experience, they are not a direction that incubators, VCs etc. like to take. They like ""sustainable"", which is mostly business as usual.

I am curious: anon1138917760 does this tension play out at COACT? How do you yourself see it?"

<image here> 
 


We thank @anon846549441, @anon2674660368, @anon3529867364, @anon2205132963, @anon2516847305 and @anon2855557573 for joining.

The goal of the call was to discuss the Deep Green research goal and Festival Events.

We did so in a wider sense discussing Edgeryders goal to map the field of anon1138917760 to get engaged in helping with sustainable and green ideas and behaviour based on skills and abilities.

The discussion also brought up the topic of Solarpunk and with the help of contacts made by @anon846549441 we are now planning to reach out for a set of webchats/calls/interviews with solar punk (""Solarpunk Salon""). Stay tuned!

This in combination with Edgryders experiences and previous discussions about deeper engagement also leads to [the plan of creating an ""Organiser Interview Circle""](/t/10971)

It was also a great oportunity to learn more about @anon

Thank you very much!

We also discussed the influence of CO2 levels on intelegence and Nudist beaches.

Here the collected chat:

Hello,

Dear community members and NGI Festival Participants!

During this Community call we would like to discuss two things:

1. How locally and timely near NGI related events during the festival can help and profit each other by planning outreach, the location, food and documentation together. (Especially the organisers in Berlin and Brussels should come together here to use the opportunity to discuss such directly)

2. About travel needs and costs to bring NGI relevant speakers and participants to your event. This might be especially interesting for those organising their festival in other interesting locations and those who want to go there.

As always we meet 18:00 Brussels time on zoom: 
https://zoom.us/j/489971765

on Thursday the 8th of October.

Looking forward to speaking to you!"

# Dear community members and new participants,


An important reason why Edgeryders such a valuable resource for all of us is that communication between participants happens in a specially designed online-and-offline process. It is structured in such a way as to support everyone's personal and professional development. 

**Most people start by creating accounts on ederyders.eu and introduce themselves and what they are interested right now [here](https://edgeryders.eu/c/campfire).** This helps the community managers to connect you to the right conversations for you. Others browse what others have posted and leave thoughtful comments when they find one that interests them. 

**Every week the Edgeryders community managers host a video chat where participants discuss what the community members have all been thoughtfully writing about on the online forum.** This is a kind of virtual cafe where those who have already been part of those discussions can drop in to meet face-to-face. In order to reflect on anon1138917760 to build on what has been learned so far over a cup of coffee. 

**Those who might be new to it but interested, and would like to get involved more directly also find this a nice and easy way to get to know who and what is happening** - and anon1138917760 they can get started. 

Those calls take place every Tuesday from 18:00 to 19:00 CET (Brussels time)

Also, I added date and time to this event. This feature (to add date and time to topics in this category) is actually required, because this is anon1138917760 events are re-published on ngi.edgeryders.eu/events ([details](/t/9687)). As this feature cannot understand repeating regular events, you have two options for the community calls:

* Updating the date and time of this topic after each community call so it keeps pointing to the next upcoming one.

* Creating a separate topic for each community call.

(If you haven't seen this gray italics text thing yet: this is ""whisper mode"", a Discourse feature for admins and moderators to communicate in topics with one another, without ""normal"" users seeing it. It's good for editorial hints etc..)"

We have figured out the over all budget (12 000 EUR + 2500 EUR for travel) and now we have to plan and see anon1138917760 to distribute it and what we need to do to help each other realise the workshops, hackathons and talks.

At this point do we need some more information from your side:

At the very least we need to know:

1. Names of main organisers
2. Date
3. Title of the event
4. Short description (1-3 sentences)
5. How long is the event
6. How many people?
7. Where is the event?
8. What else do you need?

You can quickly answer that in this sheet as soon as possible (this week!):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i5sOTG-zoRrLmACPe8eW62YFi5-xsz_aUSUlAqqsCo8/edit?usp=sharing

HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER IF YOU FILL OUT THIS MORE DETAILED FORM: (Deadline 20th of September!)

https://ernordic.typeform.com/to/T5psAI

We developed this one specifically for the festival, taking into account the questions and needs that came up during the previous calls and discussions.

**We need this to be filled out by everyone contributing an event by the 20th of September!**

It is also a great help to develop your proposal post and/or prepare for the community call on the 17th of September 18:00 Brussels time:

https://zoom.us/j/788229402

During that call everyone who wants will be given up to 5 minutes to present their idea and get feedback and support from others. This is a great opportunity to develop your idea further before the initial proposal deadline on the 20th. After that date we will start to distribute budget and helpers, and the sooner you are in this process, the better!

Looking forward to your answers and to see you in the call!"

 Darnit. I got the dates confused. Are there notes or such from the meeting?

A status update from me is that I have safed the location in Malmö, for no cost, and am currently looking at the dates of the 23-24th of November with a smaller gathering on the 24th and a larger gathering on the 23d.

The plan is to organize it as a world café which includes note taking role at each table. 

I'm still double checking the travel plans but have a preliminary yes from three speakers, one from Aarhus, one from Helsinki and one from Paris.

The theme for the conference will be tech + earth with the taglines etc still to be figured out. I can create the graphics for this as well but would be happy to ensure that this is coherent with the rest of the design. 

Looking forwards to hear more about anon1138917760 things are developing. I would also be keen on partaking in a smaller call with people from the Berlin group / the Stockholm group :cherry_blossom:"

To my surprise, the MyData community seems to have a rough consensus that monetizing personal data is not a long-term sustainable way to run a data economy. The person that came up with the clearest formulation was perhaps Finnish lawyer Jussi Mäkinnen (not verbatim, I am quoting from my notes):

> When copyright was invented in the 17th century, lawmakers conjured up a new property right, the right to own something immaterial. They knew it was a bit of a ghost, with anon2726675500 grounds in terms of the legal system of the time, but they wanted a way to reward the creators and their publishers. That, anon1138917760ever, created more long-term problems than it solved. So, we have learned from the copyright story that legislating  private ownership of personal data is probably a bad idea.

The parallel with copyright seems a profound intuition. On reflection I see anon1138917760 it is, in practice, a similar situation. Humans had been producing content before copyright, but when large-scale reproduction was invented in the 16th century suddenly there was an economic value to (cheap) copies. This created a conflict on who got to appropriate that value, and as a result a new legal subsystem sprang into life. With personal data is the same: they existed before the Internet and data science, but now they are worth money, and this creates another distributive conflict. 

The chair of that same session, John Wunderlich, is Caanon2674660368n. He remarked that Caanon2674660368n First Nations have created [their own set of principles](https://fnigc.ca/ocap) around data  management. The reason:

> In the past, Aboriginal people have not been consulted about what information should be collected, who should gather that information, who should maintain it, and who should have access to it. The information gathered may or may not have been relevant to the questions, priorities and concerns of Aboriginal peoples. Because data gathering has frequently been imposed by outside authorities, it has met with resistance in many quarters.

The most enlightening presentation was Ingrid Schneider's . She is a political science professor at U Hamburg. She described four main proposals around the economics of a data society:

* Individual data ownership + micropayments (Jaron Lanier, 2015). 
* Data as public goods, managed by the state (Evgeni Morozov , 2017) 
* Data as commons (Elinor Ostrom, 1990), managed by communities.
* Fiduciary trust (David Winickoff (2003 &amp; 2005), where people commit their data to fiduciary trust, who governs the system.

Schneider discussed the relative merits of these four models, and made a case that Europe is currently ""squeezed"" between a Lanierian-dystopian America and a Morozovian China, but maybe Europe could (and should) develop a third way.

She went on to remark:

> The discussion about property rights is an Anglo-American one. In the European legal tradition, we have the notion of inalienable rights: we have them, _and we can never give them away_. I do not support the idea of data as commodities."" 

This is a very powerful idea.

And anyway

> It does not make sense for data to be a commodity, because their value arises in the aggregation.

Which means they are bought for cheap (by companies) and sold expensive.

@anon3614937280 liked the presentation too, and immediately invited Schneider to our policy summit next year. Ping also @anon2821203031: there are profound policy implications here."

I am an economist, and I think your view of what economics is about is largely shaped by the views of the majority of economists who (as with most fields) have not deeply thought about what their field is about, and so have an excessively narrow view. This doesn't matter so much for many areas, but it matters a great deal in economics. 

Economics is not at all about money -- actually money itself is useless. This is obvious -- you cannot eat it or live in it or drive it or play with it. Money is only valuable because it is possible to exchange it for things that are actually useful. Moreover, we often have a very limited idea of what those things are. The things we want are not just consumables or extras in the vast majority of cases: if you look at what people spend their money on, it is easy to see that housing is the largest item. Other large items are transportation, education, health care, clothing and food -- none of these are extras. In fact, if you look at what people want in any kind of clear way, it is obvious that these go back to the things that are mentioned in any first-year psychology course under the heading of Maslow's Pyramid of Needs. These begin with physiological needs such as housing and health care; on the second level are about security needs; on the third level revolve around the need for love and belonging; fourth level ""esteem"" or respect and self-respect; the fifth is creativity and self-expression. Whatever people want are some combination of these needs. For most people most of the time, their focus is on creating a ""nest"" of love and belonging which fulfills their need for companionship, creating and fostering children, and caring for loved ones.

By and large, the great majority of environmental problems around consumption are not associated with what people want, but with the industrial processes by which those products are produced. Since people are focused on their direct needs, they are less concerned with processes. Moreover, they want to use their available resources to obtain as much of their desired life as they can, so cost is a big factor, and this can drive processes.

So it seems to me there are several takeaways: one is to educate people to be more concerned with the ways in which the products they use affect the world around them and on  anon1138917760 they can push suppliers to make products in more environmentally friendly ways. This is starting but needs to progress a lot more, and schools are a great place for this to happen.  The second is to sensitize children from birth in love for nature. Unfortunately this is currently headed in the opposite direction, as we are increasingly isolated from nature in our technology and controlled indoor environments. Schools also need to help here, although families are the most important. And then from a more directly economics point of view, environmental costs of industrial processes need to be made part of the price of goods, so that price signals reflect actual costs. Rather than regulation it is better to tax environmental damages, so that companies can use the least costly means to reduce the damage they cost.

So there is a political component, but also a major educational component, and an underlying economic thrust to these measures."
1,59949,2019-09-26T07:26:07.650Z,10883,0,7,6,3,0,0,16.4,59949,anon280016435,anon280016435,"At the NGI Forum @anon2821203031 and Harry Armstrong held a workshop on a potential future NGI Trustmark, a certification for technology considered to live up to the ideals of an ""internet for humans"". These are my notes from the workshop. Katja and Harry, please add what I have missed and correct what I might have misunderstood.

Trustmarks are nothing new, they exist for everything from fair-trade for food to energy efficiency for domestic appliances. They exist because, without them, ethical technologies are hard to find. It's a fragmented marketplace and there is a lack of coordination. NGI has an opportunity to address that by developing a Trustmark, and this workshop was one step in that direction.

Of course, defining ""ethical"" is no easy feat. Things to be considered could be privacy, fairness, bias, sustainability, security and countless other factors. There are many open questions, and this workshop did not aim to limit the scope but was rather an open exploration of the topic.

We know that there is some appetite for data protection trustmarks. One participant quoted a figure stating that 67% of consumers would like for such a certification to exist. But data protection is only one aspect of ethical data-driven technology, and the consumer appetite for other consideration is unclear. 

In a way, terms of service are like very long and opaque trustmarks for what companies may do with your data. However, as we know, they are close to useless from a consumer perspective as a tool to compare technologies. One sort of trustmark could focus on making sure that terms of services live up to certain standards and include respectful defaults.

GDPR has also become something of a trustmark, being used as shorthand when talking about data protection. What makes it effective is that there is accountability. As one participant said: ""You are trusted because you are accountable"".

This workshop did not go into detail, but we managed to write down some interesting opportunities and challenges of developing a trustmarks.

### Opportunities 

* It creates a branding for ethical product, creating a virtuous circle where you must be certified to compete.
* You can start creating new products based on being certified ethical, much like some lines of washing machines have as their unique selling point to be energy efficient.
* Companies can account for what value consumers are giving up to get something for free. Facebook and its ilk would then have to be very upfront about its business model during signup. 
* A well-designed mark can become a strong marketing tool, by making the mark itself a brand.
* A certifying body could include individual consumers who are, as a group, given equal weight to the industry. 
* AI bias is difficult because reducing bias often decreases accuracy. AI bias could be addressed by requiring companies to be upfront about what trade-offs they have accepted and anon1138917760 their AIs are biased. This is much like anon1138917760 human bias (internalized racism, sexism, etc) is addressed by becoming aware of one's own bias. 
* Sustainability, security and ethics of data centers could be certified by independent observers, similar to UN polling observants.

### Challenges 

*  A trust mark with high standards might not work, if every single data giant ends up with a bad rating, trustmark might come across as too punitive
* Privacy might be the easy part of the certification, but fairness will be harder. Addressing AI bias and error is harder.
*  Where would such a trustmark be placed? How would you see it?
*  If the trustmarks becomes something that one ""pays a premium"" for, will privacy and ethical tech become even more of an elite privilege? 
*  Who pays to certify open source software?
*  Entrenched business models will lobby against it.
*  It can easily become a barrier for entry for startups if not done right.

At the end of the workshop, participants were asked to name one thing that they though a trustmark must cover. These were some answers (I didn't catch everything):
* Transparency: A non-technical person must be able to understand in a reasonable time frame, for what purpose and anon1138917760 is it collected and used? Steps forward for the commission would be to look at existing best practice for sustainability trustmarks in particular. 
* People don't know anon1138917760 their data is being used, and the next step is to make those who break trust pay.
* Simplicity and usability of the mark are key.
* Create respectful defaults. One such concrete default would be to always have a user accessible off-switch for the AI. (On this point, one participant recommended a book on urban planning called [""Massive small""](https://www.massivesmall.org/)."
2,59952,2019-09-26T07:50:13.341Z,10883,0,6,5,2,0,0,11.2,59949,anon280016435,anon280016435,"Following up with some of my own remarks.

I think there is an inherent difference between at least two categories of trustmarks. One category is exemplified by the energy efficiency certification on a washing machine an the other by a fairtrade sticker on a banana. While the first has some direct and appreciated practical consequences for the owner of the washing machine, namely a lower electricity bill, the person buying the fairtrade banana only gets to feel like they are doing the right thing. 

I would argue that an NGI Trustmark will be more like the sticker on the banana than the sticker on the washing machine. It is true that leaked personal data due to lax cybersecurity, or sold personal data due to lax ethics, may have an individual impact, but this is really a franon2855557573 phenomenon. A vast majority of people who get their data leaked or sold are only a single datapoint in hundreds of thousands of others, and will usually suffer no consequences as a result. There are exceptions – people who for one reason or another are more likely to be harassed or targeted are also harmed more than others by leaks – but this almost per definition a minority. Instead, the consequences of leaked or sold data are usually societal and structural – lex Cambridge Analytica, and in that real security becomes an elite privilege. 

This is this relevant because I think it might be wise to not try to make this sticker into something that focuses on what the consumer is getting from the product because I think most consumers will just keep making the long term privacy trade-off for the short term price tag. This is also relevant for design and branding, as the strategy pursued to get people to care about a fair-trade sticker is probably very different from a campaign promoting energy efficiency certification."

What I'm writing is based on developing the [Trustable Technology Mark](https://trustabletech.org), a trustmark for connected consumer products, issued by our non-profit, [ThingsCon](https://thingscon.org). So that's the area I looked at most closely, but I think a lot might apply beyond IoT.

So, there are various categories of ""trust marks"", some more explicit than others, like: Certifications, which often certify compliance with a law or regulation, like the CE mark, or the more general ""consumer marks"" or ""trust marks"", which depending on the jurisdiction are less ""hard"" so to speak. Either one of them needs an issuing body, meaning for larger scale projects we're talking about large organizations.

(ThingsCon's Trustable Technology Mark is both very young and a very small project, and technically speaking not a certification but a mark we license companies to use if they meet certain criteria for transparency and other aspects. Details matter in these things.)

That said, after having studied this for anon2298377336 some time but without a longer-term background in this space I think it's fair to say that just about any assumption you'd make (""it just needs to do X by Y in oder to demonstrate Z"") is anon2298377336 likely not going to stand up to a somewhat rigorous kicking of the proverbial tires. For things that are as vague/debatable as ""ethical"" or ""fair"" or even the much easier (but still freakishly hard to define) ""private"", even a baseline definition is incredibly hard, because we're talking about nearly philosophical debates plus _a lot_ of contextual interpretations.

That said, I'm not here to grump around and I would like to see more of this in the world. So practically speaking, what are the challenges and opportunities?

Challenges:

* Trust in the issuing org: Who is the trusted authority of issuing this trust mark? 
* Legal status: Is this a thing that's legally required for entering the market, i.e. a regulation? In that case, funding will not be an issue, but it'll have to be a so-called ""base line certification"", meaning a LOT of products need to be able to get it. This is a much lower standard than we might want. Think of the CE mark: It indicates that your TV won't set the house on fire, but it doesn't guarantee it's well made in any other way.
* Reach: If anon1138917760ever the standard we aim for is higher, than by definition less products will qualify, meaning it must almost by definition be a voluntary thing. Which is good for many things, but means we're now talking about massive outreach or marketing, and likely about requiring a business model. If anon1138917760ever you get paid for issuing this, then there's already a potential conflict of interest to issue as many as possible, so it might erode trust into the mark itself.
* For anything connected, a software update might change important details or features, and also what happens to the data is often something that happens far from the actual product in the cloud, or on third party servers. Whatever the trustmark promises, it needs to apply to every party that has access to the data or that is involved in bringing this product into the world.
* Verification: How does the issuing body verify its claims? Are there external audits (good but expensive), is it based on companies providing the info (cheap but harder to trust), or some hybrid?

Doteveryone, for example, has studied this in depth [and decided not to go the route of a trustmark](https://doteveryone.org.uk/2019/09/digital-products-and-services-arent-bananas/) and instead just to offer guidelines for making better products, as has the [Better IoT initiative](https://betteriot.org), and frankly with ThingsCon we were short of going that same route (but were really curious to see if we could make it happen - and we'll know in a few years time).

Opportunities:

* I'd offer the counter claim to what @anon280016435 was saying about consumers' attitudes towards privacy and data protection (thanks Hugi for sharing this; I agree with pretty much the rest you're saying), as well as potential damages. Currently it's not like consumers have a real choice, and if you have to choose between unsafe and not using important services, you'll have to expose yourself to the risk. I think consumers care about privacy anon2298377336 a lot and make the best choices they can, but only have a very narrow band of choices. I also believe that it's not nearly as niche as it's often portrayed and instead the damage in fraud, eroded trust, lost productivity, etc. is anon2298377336 large, even though I hasten to add I haven't studied this in-depth (so take it with a grain of salt).
* Nobody has figured out what this means for connected products yet. This is a huge opportunity, because consumers are largely in the dark about what's ok and what isn't. Currently we see a giant market failure there.
* A trustmark, whichever shape it takes, could also be complementary to regulation that heavily fines sloppy practices if they hurt consumers. There are many mechanism to potentially make this happen; I'm not familiar with the current state of debate around this, but I'm sure Harry might know. 
* Finally, I'd say that consumers would hugely benefit from a trustmark if it's established and gains traction, even if they don't know the details of what it checks for. Let's face it, most trustmarks we trust work in ways we're not familiar with, at very different levels, many of which we're so familiar with that depending on context we might not even perceive as such but everybody knows anon1138917760 to interpret according to their own preferences. To give just a few examples from recent debates: Fairtrade; BlueSign; Made in Germany; the fire department colors; CE; and most brand names all the way from Amazon to Red Cross. Trustmarks are everywhere, and they come in many shapes.

One thing I'd caution against is to come up with One Trustmark To Rule Them All. Either one of the areas tagged above (privacy, fairness, trustworthiness, sustainability, etc etc.) are huge and complex areas. Something can be extremely fair but not at all private, or perfectly secure yet offer no protection against abuse of data in the way the product is designed; etc. etc. Sustainability for technology is *incredibly* hard, as is privacy, especially if we're comparing across jurisdictions/countries/cultures. (Privacy and data protection are interpreted fundamentally differently in the US than in Germany, for example.)

In the end, whoever creates the mark has to decide what they aim to cover and make choices, including many hard choices. No trustmark will solve all issues for everyone. But it might solve some issues for some, or even for many - and that's absolutely an endeavor worth engaging in."

We all share some basic ideas of what that is, and I remember when there was no certification for it anywhere.  But a variety of certifying orgs emerged and governments got involved.  So, now we all still have our notions of what organic means, and generally speaking we are correct - no pesticides or chemical fertilizers was where it started.  But now it is much more complex than that and not all standards agree.  And some standards don't cover certain aspects of it, like organic animal products, and some do.  It's kind of all over the map. Plus, government certifications are subject to political pressure (in the US, the government issues certain exemptions for certain ingredients in certain foods. Lots of grey area in there).

So it is all pretty squishy, but overall we benefit from it, even with all the variables."

====

Welcome to this text and brewing. It has been developed within me, grown from the seedling of microsolidarity, in the soil of syndicalism and anarchism, over the course of many months now.

To start of, I want to specify what I believe Microsolidarity is necessary for, in extention to the points provided in the [original article](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/courage-before-hope-a-proposal-to-weave-emotional-and-economic-microsolidarity-87bc81372a09). 

## **Microsolidarity is a necessary step to hinder mass-manipulation in contemporary society.**

I have come to strongly believe this. I will attempt to bring you with me on my thought journey. I will also try to include my emotions as I believe one (*thought*) is seldomly without the other (*emotion*) no matter anon1138917760 contemporary scientific paradigms may portray it. This display of emotion and thought in combo is not something I have done before, I guess practice makes.... . . .  So now, to continue my imperfection:

_________________

### 1. Finding the question and the freudian id

With the points of ""14 billion anon3386180186s of ice melting just yesterday"", ""a need for people to come together"", ""to shape new ways of society"" and ""to connect and support each other"", all rang true to me, strong enough for Microsolidarity to embed itself within my thought patterns, I had yet to see anon1138917760 it connected, en masse, and why it would even come to happen at all. 

In a dark corner of my mind, a bitter voice was whispering ""Why would this even take off?"". I tried not listening to the voice as best I could but silently started looking for an answer. It seemed too big of a task for humans to re-organize. I would have to see an innate contemporary human need, which microsolidarity could provide for, before I could truly believe Microsolidarity could take off. 

About two years before I read the article on Microsolidarity I watched a documentary called ""[The Swedish Theory of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfyKYeaZcIM)"". Perhaps it spoke to me as a love seeking Swede, but more so it spoke to me in its reflections on the arcitechture of the isolation designed one-room, four-people-families of todays skyrises and white-picket-fence-den societies. A change which has come upon Northern Hemisphere humans in the latest 0,001% of her history. I had seen the need. Could Microsolidarity be a cure of loneliness, the satisfaction to a deep human need, a *desirable* solution?

### 2. Exploring the Need
I observed todays society to find an answer as to why society had not already collapsed by the architectured societal loneliness, for my inner logus told me it should've. I found that in a timely fashion, internet and the world wide web came to be, creating and comforting with a community for those for whom there were none.

I look at the internet and see a substitution, a band-aid to the loneliness. Corporations feeding endorphines and a sense of belonging to the infected wounds of isolation.

What started irking me was who that sense of belonging was to, really? The identites of the communities, ranging from Twitter to Reddit, from Instagram to Tumbler, were rarely through connections to any individual people but to the masse of agreed jargon and inside-jokes, meta-memes, gifs or trends. More musings on this can be [found here](%8+CGdFA7Zj+onCSva39wP2kmKIzEl9FgWvSETHWFLI0=.sha256) yet the bottom line was that these spaces were filled with payed for content, inceptions placed there with corporate incentive, propagand/commercials wearing costumes made up of memes or other relevant community coding to melt into the social settings of the artificial communities.  

### 3. Conclusion

So what had I found so far? 

- I had found that there was a need that Microsolidarity could fill: lonliness. 
- I had found that the need was already covered by artificial communities on the www. 
- I had found that these artificial communities were easy to incept with messages if one has money and that it was already happening as there was no real way of differentiating between the ""real"" users and corporate shills.

The breeding ground for mass-manipulation is close to reaching its final form, setting the anon3386180186e and delivering messages with disguised messengers. 

What did I feel? 

- Slight desperation
- An urgency to do something
- A big ""Ahaaaaaa"" moment
- An increased personal need for Microsolidarity

My conclusion is that Microsolidarity is not only a great way to go about reshaping and rebuilding the world, it is a means to avoid the dystopia which inevitably comes with mass-manipulation. 

It allows for this 

Microsolidarity is not only a step for a healthier earth and person, it's a necessary step of rebellion.

Working in a garage, playing in a rock band, forging new kinds of online community...things like that.

**The more cities are being connected and thus turned into Smart Cities, the more our society faces complex issues around power dynamics, control, and access.** In other words, where machine decision making (artificial intelligence, machine learning; take your pick) starts impacting and shaping our public space, every single citizen is impacted by technological systems that are largely black boxes.

Today, the discourse around Smart Cities is largely dominated by the vendors of smart city tech: The debate is using their language, the framing of possible solutions matches their products. There isn’t anything malign going on, either - but the arguments are one-sided and myopic: They are selling technical “solutions” to complex societal challenges. This can never work, and is problematic in a myriad of ways.

**I propose to re-frame the Smart City discourse away from a technology focus and towards a focus on societal impact** and ask a different set of questions than the tech vendors’ solutions are trying to answer - like the following: 

What are the potential impacts we can have when introducing a data layer and machine decision making into public space? What are the desirable consequences, what are the damages we need to avoid? What are the intended vs unintended potential consequences, and what are the known unknowns? How can we design a city to be resilient and worth living in, instead of just a anon2726675500 more efficient?

**In other words: What are better urban metrics in cities increasingly governed or shaped by algorithms? How can we put people first and make sure that their cities, their public spaces and agoras work for all of them and not just for the companies that sell some of the infrastructure?**

Working out these metrics, an analytical framework for assessing what’s desirable in a Smart City, is the key to unlocking a real, meaningful debate. It’s the basis on which policy makers, using participatory processes and involving all stakeholder groups, get empowered to start drafting meaningful Smart City policies and procurement guidelines. It’s an important building block in allowing us to move society forward, one city at a time.

At this point, I’m convinced we need to build all Smart City policies around citizens/digital/human rights first, and with a strong priority on participatory processes, transparency, and accountability. 

Beyond that, these metrics need fleshing out. It’s this project that I’m proposing to tackle together with the Edgeryders community.

I think you are spot on. Like all tech, but in a more direct way, the suites of solutions that make up the smart city encode values and power relationships. Building the smart city is not conceptually far from building the [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu): it demands technical choices that encode values. For now, in both cases, the values have been those of vendors and business. 

If you de-emphasize them, you can go anon2298377336 some way towards ""smart"". [I used to talk of ""Type 1-"" and ""Type 2 smart cities""](http://www.cottica.net/2012/11/28/what-we-mean-by-smart-in-smart-cities/). Type 2 are non-vendor dominated, and so they can do some smart things that imply the destruction of GDP. They can do repair cafés, and car bans, and community welfare, and mesh networks. They can be cheap and resilient and inclusive. 

But even these things are not ""smart"" for everybody. They encode _my_ values, and those of my tribe. And these are great, but in any healthy city there _must_ be people who steer by other stars, who care about different things. Cities are ambiguous, because their social engine is diversity. Diversity fuels exchange, personal growth and prosperity, but also conflict and uneasiness. A stronger police present makes the parent of young children feel safer, but makes life miserable for African- and Arab-looking teenagers. A late night bar can be a place of joy for the younger citizens in the neighborhood, but a source of nuisance for the older folks that live upstairs from it. For this reason, I am unconvinced that you can find ""metrics"". Whose metrics are we talking about? 

In his [2013 pamphlet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/12/02/city-cynic-against-the-smart-city-by-adam-greenfield-review/#4784384f3b19), Adam Greenfield makes a convincing case that there can be no unambiguous, value-neutral metrics to maximize. Cities have to be regulated by endless dialogue and debate, right out in the agora. In other words, though the notion is unpopular, by politics. I am afraid he is right. If by some miracle you could steer a city by keeping metrics at nominal value, you would have reduced its complexity to the point where it is no longer a city, but something like a jail, or an amusement attraction like Disneyland."

Currently, smart city projects are often ushered in through the back door of public procurement in processes so obscure and opaque as to be essentially free from meaningful oversight.

Greenfield is an urban planner. I think his focus is on what makes a city a city. The criterion of circularity is great, but it can be applied to a single company, or household, or even a single activity, a single machine. Scholars or cities are looking in a different direction: they want metrics that you can apply to the _interactions_ that happen in a city. For example, Le Corbusier seems to have believed that traffic speed was an unambiguously positive thing: faster is better, and so he imagined large, straight, multilane boulevards. Greenfield is saying, no. There is no metric `x` such that, if `W` denotes welfare (anon1138917760ever you would measure that): 

```
∂W/∂x > 0 forall x 
```
And yes, you can say circularity is unambiguously positive, but that pertains to a different level of analysis."

That's anon2298377336 a good illustration of the very different scenarios that can be supported by IoT technology. The first is empowering (though only in support of current elites). The other is disempowering (as consumers are force-fed avoidable consumption goods by exploiting human psychological weaknesses with micro-targeted ads). At least in online shopping, the second scenario is reality already.

I suppose what you're heading for is realizing an empowering scenario for ""ordinary citizens"" using IoT and IT technology. And I very much agree that there is a huge unexplored potential for that. To this date, I don't know of any existing system that would provide military-style ""jointness"" capabilities to citizens. If we had that around, and it would be in widespread use, it's hard to imagine the power that citizens would have with that. Perhaps the closest real-life demonstration was the Spanish Indignados movement and the Arab Spring, both largely organized via Twitter messages. But what a poor substitute microblogging is for a military-style jointness system. It's like I've heard once: ""You _can_ use a word processor software for everything, including writing a newspaper and organizing a revolution, but for most things there are much better tools for the job.""

While not the IoT angle directly, I have my own long-term interest in jointness software for civilians, including for grassroots movements and social organizing. (In [my final thesis](https://ma.juii.net/ma-documents/main/CommunityGroupware.Thesis.pdf) when studying computer science, I tried my hand at designing such a system. Not sure what value that thesis has in 2019, but yes, I have a history of interest in this stuff. :-) )

([p. 20](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=12))

It's amazing anon1138917760 similar that sounds to my vision of the [Autarkic City](/t/9141) :slight_smile: 

> There are moments when society is ready to act on a specific issue. ([p. 21](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=12))

Totally agreed. With @anon

So if we want a successful grassroots response to climate breakdown, we need one that takes these limits into account. I am not too sure yet, but I think that action on the demand side will be more effective than directly fighting against greenhouse gas emitting big industries. Think a grassroots movement converting society towards being carbon negative, one house at a time.

What I have not (yet) found in your paper is a concrete vision of anon1138917760 a self-governed Internet of People society would look like. What tech, what software, what forms of social organization might it use? It's still a bit of an abstract vision to me. (Admittedly I am going into the other extreme … my visions tend to take the form of lists of equipment, and of course society won't implement it like that …)

> Extending this Cuban example, the Russian anarchist Kropotkin offers a powerful vision of production through small-scale physical workshops, which in the Internet of People brings together low and high-tech bike repair and sensor networks. […] 
> 
> This model of local workshops allows people to do a variety of work, some manual, some intellectual, some exciting and some less so. If we produce things in our local area, we get fulfillment from our multiple roles of manual work as well as empowering brainwork and will not need “hobbies” anymore. The Internet of People enables a vision of globally interconnected workshops that change the type of things we produce, as well as our social and cultural relations in which we do so. ([p. 26](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=15))

I think this is such a 2011 thing to say :-) 2011 was prime time for low-cost FDM 3D printers, for [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org) with their vision of an open source civilization, and so on. It felt hopeful, and I like the memory. And whil I still stick to that vision of an open source and collaborative world – the local manufacturing revolution turned out to be way more difficult to start than we imagined in 2011 …

In my view of today, that is largely because people are locked into the mainstream economy of with its price competition and the resulting winner-takes-all mass production by the current money system and by the huge needs for money that are not simple to replace with ""local production"" in the sense of self-supply, as it needs economic exchange. For the urban population, that is mostly rent. And as and while (1) money is scarce for much of the population and (2) prices of non-locally-produced item (read: from China) are cheaper, people are locked into the mainstream economy for the time being.

Recognizing this resulted (for me and a co-founder) into another startup called PayCoupons that aims to replace money in the local economy with algorithmic network bartering, to unlock local production in a space protected from global competition over price alone. More about that [here](https://blog.pay.coupons/e0b203f350fc).

But starting that kind of marketplace in Europe while the economy is officially ""well"" is difficult. As dark as that sounds, we'll need another economic crisis before a tool like that will get the attention it deserves.

> In the coming years, […] [the IoT Council] can advise governments and institutions on anon1138917760 to transform into interconnected workshops. ([p. 30](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=17))

I like that vision of interconnected workshops :) Has there been practical progress on proposed standards for distributed manufacturing in the years since the publication of the 2011 pamphlet?

In particular, I am interested in standards for versioned, collaborative development of designs for physical items, including dependency management between them. It would be ""like [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) for physical products"" and ""like a software [package management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_management_system) for installing designs of products"".

With that in place, it's not far fetched to automatically or semi-automatically feed this into CNC machines or a flexible manufacturing system like [CubeSpawn](https://cubespawn.com/).

But so far, I don't know of any practical standard for this kind of data exchange. There has been [SKDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n39RK4inzg), [VOICED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOICED) and now [Wikifactory](https://wikifactory.com/), but none of it is usable for its stated purpose so far. I am always tempted to just create that standard myself, package the first 100 existing open hardware projects in the format, and see if it will catch on …

> We exist in complex relationships with our environment simply by living our everyday lives. If we would get feedback on anon1138917760 we feel and anon1138917760 we might feel better, anon1138917760 our talents could get recognized, anon1138917760 we could relate better to our neighbors, then having sensors and actuators make sense. ([p. 37](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=20))

I guess is this is where our visions for the future start to differ. My vision, with its focus on autarky-enhancing technology, is to _reduce_ the complexity of the modern environment to something manageable. Complexity to be managed by an end user will actually rise as people will have to learn a lot of new and strange tech. But most of the hidden and uncontrollable dependencies from external entities of a mass society will vanish, this way putting citizens back in control of their lives and wellbeing.

> Proximity […] In the future Internet of People, we will have to rely much more on our immediate environment for support. We are already linked to our neighbors with power and water but in the future we may have to rely on them for growing food and making things. What we are really talking about is a kind of mutual responsibility that we might call solidarity. ([p. 42](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=23))

I read this as a high-tech reincarnation of the village-based economies that existed in central Europe until about 1960, and that still exist in many parts of the world, including villages in Nepal that I visited. Good solutions come back when unsustainable forms of social organization end :slight_smile:

If only there was a way to persuade villagers in Nepal that the system they have is good to begin with and that they just need to add some tech to make everything more efficient, safe and comfortable. No need to break the whole structure of society down in the name of ""progress"", just to come back to the same roots decades later.

> This will leave our environment and us with an amorphous mass of data to make sense of. It’ll also bring about new identities for things. What are our tools for sense making at the moment? […] We want everybody to be able to draw on the largest and most available amount of data. [I]t will also create new forms of decision making for large groups of people and small communities on the basis of newly available data. ([p. 47](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=25))

While I don't have  much of an opinion about big data, other than that it's useful for scientists and others with the time and skills to analyze it adequately, here's a complementary perspective that needs IoT devices as well, and right now.

Let's call it ""tiny data"". In the highly resilient society of the future, we'll have to rely on local resources much more than now. This can be a city-level or neighborhood-level micro-grid or an off-grid house, or probably all of these to have multiple levels of redundancy. I am personally living off-grid and from that experience I can tell that good monitoring of ones energy, water, wastewater, heating and cooling systems is essential for wise resource use and proper functioning. For example, I know that I need 500-700 Wh of photovoltaics energy a day, and that I can cope with at most 10 days of gray sky in winter. That's where IoT comes in. Network-connected sensors and an evaluation software would combine local consumption data and weather forecasts into behavior recommendations.

For an energy system using this kind of technology for monitoring, demand management, ""energy solidarity"" and other purposes, I [published some notes](/t/9731/6) in an earlier treat we were having here in the IoH forum. No such thing exists on the market today.

> The total overview is impossible. […] It is the communal and participatory uncovering of the machinery that administers “area construction,” which creates what I call system thinking. System thinking is the personal and communal awareness that all things are connected in multiple networks of agency. It thus creates a space for multiple intelligences to form new kinds of awareness. ([p. 48](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=26))

Again, let me introduce a complementary perspective: systems engineering. Indeed, we may not be able to ever uncover or understand in whole anon1138917760 our world or local environment works. But instead of accepting this as ""a feature and not a bug"", the other option is to reconstruct the world, including the technosphere and social relations, to conform to principles of good systems engineering (hiding of complexity, public and private interfaces, reusability, redundancy and so on). A too complex world is an engineering failure – because too much social complexity is the main risk for societal collapse in the face of an arising resource shortage (as per [Joseph A. Tainter: The Collapse of Complex Societies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AOZ3PM)).

What I have discovered in my various explorations of and experiments with autarky-enhancing technology is that this is a largely unexplored area with a high potential for creating a resilient and sustainable civilization with modern comforts and only the essential complexity. This is certainly no silver bullet as there will not be total autarky on the household or city level in the foreseeable future. I'm mentioning it as a complementary approach to the problem of complexity: instead of only using better mental models to understand it and deal with it, we can also discard it and ""start from scratch"".

**Summary:** the last part of the book, ""[Sociability Standards for the Internet of People](http://www.situatedtechnologies.net/files/ST8_InternetOfPeople_web.pdf#page=28)"", is a good summary of the design guidelines developed throughout that document (also good for everyone interested to join the discussion but needing a _tl;dr_). Summing up my comments by going along that list:

* **Proximity:** I see that as an essential property of resilience and economic fairness in a future society, and it fits right in with my own notion of local autarky and PayCoupons, our innovation for local economic exchange. Proximity and local production should not be confused with anti-globalization: all knowledge should be globalized, for proper global collaboration. So it's rather in the realm of alter-globalization.

* **System Thinking:** Above, I proposed systems engineering as a complementary approach to system complexity, and a local and fully circular economy (""autarky"") as a possible outcome. I like the practical proposals though, esp. ""Systems that automatically generate a fixed, public discussion url for each item."". That would be a good entry point to share user-generated knowledge about using an item / type of product, to report issues and contribute to its development in an open source manner, and to interface with a lending system, second hand offers of the product etc..

* **Affect:** That's really interesting to me as it sanon1138917760s a gap in my designs for local autarky so far. I have no idea though what kind of changes could incorporate a space for emotions and conflict into local autarky tech – I might not be the right person to have that idea, but then somebody else will be."

This looks close to the solarpunk vision promoted by people like @anon

It seems to me that *local, but deep* deployments could be a nice addition to EU policies in this direction. Because:

1. Scientifically, they allow to observe the co-evolution of technical and social change ""in the wild"".
2. Politically, it gives people (including decision makers) powerful metaphors for anon1138917760 things could work if you let them. 
3. They would be inclusive of the (highly skilled) hacker/solarpunk communities, who – frankly – do not care about the next directive, and do not think high level policy make much positive impact anyway.
3. (On the other hand, there is always the risk of making Potemkin villages, it the Powers That Be become invested in them.)

Makes sense? Should we (NGI Forward) consider proposing something around these lines?"

But for a lot of future applications of information technology, a local well-developed demo project is both locally useful and empowering (which is what will involve the hackers) and politically a model of what can be done.

### Example: power demand management

Let's take an example, again one that is a rich field for IoT application. Right now there are zero incentives for adjusting electricity demand to available renewable electricity supply. Electricity prices can go negative at times on wholesale markets (happens in Germany when there's a lot of sun and wind at the same time). But consumers always pay the same per kWh. And so there is no demand for products that control loads based on the supply of electricity – and also, no such products are on offer, and I think not even technical standards exist for this yet. Instead what we have is offer management: large photovoltaics plants are required to throttle down when the grid receives too much electricity input, and there are standards for this kind of artificial scarcity.

However, if one town or city would decide, as one of the local deep deployments you propose, to invest into a cooperatively owned photovoltaics plant, actual electricity consumption will be free as long as consumption stays within the limits of the available power. And for that, there would be a new kind of device that is added to a dishwasher, washing machine, charger for an electrical car or even a deep freezer (within more tight limits) and communicates with the grid and the user to schedule operation according to both the available renewable energy supply and user demand."

Two ideas I wanted to add to the mix. The amazing designer [Anab Jain wrote about the need for ""more than human-centered design.""](https://dingdingding.org/issue-2/more-than-humancentered-design/) We know cities are more than just people. They contain all sorts of organisms and complex ecosystems. These have to thrive, too, if we except cities to be healthy for their citizens. 

Also, I'm increasingly impressed with the [citizen assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) format, [pioneered in Ireland](https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/) and now being rolled out elsewhere, to discuss issues across differing political positions. It resulted in reframing the abortion referendum with a more nuanced question that got to the heart of what the citizens wanted to decide. I think national governments, cities and even neighborhoods could implement these kinds of assemblies to great success."

# Iranian politics, white guy editors test Wikipedia’s high-minded mission
When you search for my husband’s last name, the only Google results are links to an opera sanon2855557573r with the same name. But for a brief moment in time, a few years ago, his family name was listed in Wikipedia’s category: “Royalty of Georgia (country).” His family isn’t royal, and never has been. Presumably out of boredom, my husband edited the wiki entry and inserted his last name. It stayed up for months. And when it was deleted, he changed it back. This time, it only stayed up for a couple of hours.

My husband’s edit was inconsequential. But not all edits on Wikipedia are as trivial as his.

[Sina Zekavat describes in his piece for OpenDemocracy](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/north-africa-west-asia/persian-wikipedia-independent-source-or-tool-iranian-state/) anon1138917760 he found major differences between pages on Iranian events, the country’s history and politics in English and in Persian. Content in English gives much more nuanced context, often with hundreds of verified sources; the Persian versions read like rote pro-government propaganda with dead links and footnotes to government-sponsored news outlets.

In  2007, Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales praised an Iranian contributor for his defiance ([see his video for Amnesty International on free speech here](https://youtu.be/0suY1pMJN08?t=84)). But the Iranian Ministry of Culture — which is responsible for the country’s “media management” — seems to work together with the non-profit Persian Wikipedia organization, and now there are talks to incorporate it into its ministry as an affiliated NGO.

“Registering Persian Wikipedia as a so called Non Governmental Organization in a state institution that is in charge of the country’s censorship apparatus can only be described as an Orwellian event,” Zekavat wrote in his article.

### **Wikipedia Matters**

I know that I’m not alone in venturing onto Wikipedia to quickly resolve a heated debate in a bar, like [whether the heart of a shrimp is “really” located in its head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean). We all use Wikipedia to some extent. It’s in the top 10 most visited websites globally, and Google conveniently places it on top of our search results. Wikipedia [supports 300 different languages, with some 46 million articles accessed by 1.4 billion unique devices every single month](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/wikipedia-explained-what-is-it-trustworthy-anon1138917760-work-wikimedia-2030-a8213446.html).

Wikipedia is as vulnerable to disinformation and manipulation as any social platform:

* The [Australian PM’s office edited Wikipedia](https://techcrunch.com/2007/08/23/wikipedia-edits-cause-australian-political-scandal/) in 2007, sparking a political crisis. 
* Jimmy Wales, one of Wikipedia’s founders, [broke up with his girlfriend by editing her Wikipedia entry](https://gawker.com/362730/wikipedia-creator-jimmy-wales-dumps-girlfriend-on-wikipedia).
* A former reporter at The Independent [edited the Wikipedia pages of a number of critics of his work](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html) in 2011.
* A Wikipedia trustee and a Wikipedian In Residence — a role held by Wikipedia editors held in high esteem — edited on behalf of PR clients, [CNET reported in 2012](https://www.cnet.com/news/corruption-in-wikiland-paid-pr-scandal-erupts-at-wikipedia/).
* The North Face in 2017 was [accused of placing pictures with people wearing their outfits](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/business/north-face-wikipedia-leo-burnett.html) on various pages.

To #stayonthestory of life under all-seeing surveillance states, subscribe to our Authoritarian Tech newsletter 

The examples go on. But lately, Wikipedia has faced considerably more heat (and not just [from among its co-founders](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bnppw4/wikipedias-co-founder-is-wikipedias-biggest-critic-511).) In [an excellent Buzzfeed article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/wikipedia-ban-editor-culture-war) worth your time, on the fury surrounding Wikipedia’s removal of a volunteer site administrator, Joseph Berstein explains that “as existential concerns about Wikipedia’s accuracy have faded into the background, demography has emerged as the most serious threat to the project’s legitimacy; it can hardly aspire to be the sum of human knowledge if only white guys create and manage it.” He cites the platform’s pornographic actress list as recently as 2015 had more edits and editors than its list of female poets. A 2017 study found that 77% of Wikipedia articles are written by 1% of its users.

Wikipedia was always a utopian project — volunteer labor, the sum of human knowledge captured and democratized, etc. But that doesn’t mean the hijacking of the Persian language Wikipedia into Iran’s censorship apparatus is inevitable. Wikipedia’s Persian language users — and not just that 1% currently doing all the heavy lifting — can take action as editors, no algorithm expertise necessary.

Jain, the head of Michigan State University’s Biometrics Research Group, is facing major backlash for his involvement with Chinese academics, especially since his research is used by the Chinese government for their facial recognition tech to track Uyghurs and send them to internment camps. 

![229|690x361](upload://aeQ10vf4h20nEdkeYoa1OqLGVcA.png) 

In 2018, Jain traveled to Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi to give a speech about facial recognition at the Chinese Conference on Biometrics Recognition (CCBR). Jain was also on the CCBR’s advisory board and was pictured receiving an honorary certificate.

> Jain is regarded as one of the world’s most influential computer scientists and a pioneer in areas of pattern recognition and biometric recognition systems. He has won countless awards and honors and is often quoted on U.S. facial recognition issues in publications like Wired and Slate. In the same month as Jain presented a paper titled “From the Edge of Biometrics: What’s Next?” at the CCBR conference in Urumqi, a United Nations human rights panel described Xinjiang as resembling a “massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy.” [LINK](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/influential-us-scientist-under-fire-xinjiang-links/)

Biometrics have played a major role in the Chinese “anti-terror” crackdown on its Muslim minority the Uyghurs. Thousands have been detained in so-called ""re-education camps,"" and facial recognition, DNA collection, iris scans, and more have played a major role in it.

**We're talking here about a new internet, one where the internet and tech (such as in smart cities) is a tool to help us move forward. But what if the research isn't used to help us move forward, but instead is used against us?**

> David Tobin, a lecturer at the University of Glasgow who studies security in China, said researchers in technical fields often ignore the real-world applications of their research. “It is imperative that natural scientists be trained in social sciences to understand these effects and the world they make things for and in ethics to be able to ask these questions when they construct, conduct, and disseminate their research,” he said. “However, such training and knowledge is sadly lacking in these fields and public debates rely on false dichotomies between natural and social worlds and between facts and values.”

It is not even a new subject. Northern Italy is the home to a healthy industry around firearms and assorted weaponry. Everything is overboard. Workers are well treated and unionized. Companies pay their taxes and sponsor cultural events. They say they ""supply police forces"" and ""national defense systems"", and they do. But they also make dark, cruel products. 

One such company, called [Valsanon204016368](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsanon204016368_Meccanotecnica), was destroyed by a massive scandal in the 1990s, when it became known it was selling anti-personnel landmines to Iraq, later deployed in the Gulf War and against the Kurdish populations. The political pressure became too strong, and the company had to fold. 

In Internet Tech, too, Italians have their own dark history. If you have been paying attention, you will remember a company called Hacking Team ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team#Controversies)), who sold offensive intrusion and surveillance systems to governments like Sudan, Venezuela or Saudi Arabia. This became known in 2015, when the company was itself hacked, and internal documents put on BitTorrent and picked up by Wikileaks. The scandal led to the Italian government revoking the company's license to sell  spyware outside of Europe. 

So what to do? Not sure. Double edges are an integral part of innovation. The printing press was developed to print indulgence certificates, and its ""venture investor"" was the archbishop of Mainz; but it was immediately appropriated by Martin Luther's reformers to condemn the practices of selling indulgences. It was also used to print bibles, pornographic literature, advertisements, etc. etc.  It comes down to whether you believe in liberal democracy. If you do, you build an elaborate system of checks and balances, and hope for the best. 

It would also help to break the alignment between obvious evils like imprisonment and torture and profit. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes says that prisons should *never, ever* be run by private companies, and I can see where she is coming from. Maybe you could consider taking biometrics out of the private sector?"

I don't have a specific pitch, but I still feel like I might have something relevant to contribute because creativity, collaboration, and technology are my passions.

As a kid, I was writing, drawing, building fictional worlds, building my own board games. I was a relentless dungeon master, fantasy reader and so on. Later I got a computer and all the possibilities in the online world completely consumed me.

I taught myself the dark technology called JavaScript and started a freelance career building web apps.
My main specialty is Ember.js (this forum runs on Ember :slight_smile: ), and now I'm dabbling with React.

I had a lot of smaller freelance projects in the past, building interactive dashboards and admins and various kinds of different websites.

I was working in a startup studio TopMonks (https://www.topmonks.com/),
I worked remotely for a Finnish startup Leadfeeder (https://www.leadfeeder.com/),
and now I am teaching programming in a coding academy (https://www.greenfoxacademy.com/).

Besides working in tech since always, I studied environmental science to see the world in a wider context. My bachelor thesis focused on indoor air pollution. I'm grateful for the knowledge I received and I'd love to use my technical skills towards improving sustainability. I'm seriously considering getting magisters in anthropology before I'm 30 :upside_down_face:. 

I have anon2298377336 a few project drafts that I'd like to work on in the future when I'm experienced and ready. The ambitious ones focus on climate change or for example collaborative worldbuilding, so far I'll just scout around."

All too often, smart city project aim to increase efficiency and/or to lower costs for administrations. Which is totally fine - until it isn't. For example, if a system is super efficient as long as it works flawlessly, but breaks down spectacularly when it does encounter any hiccups. 

Specifically, I'm interested in ways to mitigate negative consequences of failing systems in the smart city, and ways to structurally increase resilience. Here's the section from the post linked above:

""**Are there safeguards in place to prevent things from getting worse than before if something doesn’t work as planned?**
Unintended consequences are unavoidable in complex systems. But there are ways to mitigate risks, and to make sure that the fallback for a failed systems are not worse then the original status. If any project would be better while working perfectly but worse while failing, then that deserves some extra thought. If it works better for some groups but not for others, that’s usually a red flag, too.""

Do you know of any approaches to increase resilience, any best practices in this space?

the firsts phase of any disaster is chaos. there's nothing but act based on immediately obvious information. And nothing works (mobile phones, landline phones, electricity all go down.)

individual agency was key at the start:

* people put on a warning vest, and starting directing traffic at the crossing at the end of their street, to ensure emergency traffic came through.
* fire brigades from as far as 100km simply started driving towards the scene when they saw the smoke rising and didn't wait for central alerts being sent.
* people didn't wait for an ambulance but put wounded in a car and drove to hospitals etc.
* When regional radio announced the location of some medical triage points, we went out into the street where confused and dazed people were coming out of the center of the disaster zone, and guided them towards the nearest triage point / nest for the wounded.
* People brought water, made coffee and food for first responders and impromptu canteens were set-up at the edge of the affected area by those living near it.
* Pubs / restaurants / cafes opened up their doors for everyone needing shelter / a place to rest etc.

Then, after some hours, local radio became more important with providing info on the situation, advice from local government etc. This led to more organised action. Sports facilities opened up where you could bring bedding materials, red cross stepped in etc.

Over the days a new sort of order and routine emerged, built from those individual and community solidarity based starts. These were not replaced or countermanded by the official response, but taken as a base for further actions by the official response. So are a cities response systems geared towards recognising and leveraging community responses?

That in contrast was what was so extremely shocking to me with what I saw from the official response after Katrina in the US in 2005, where those individual assistance initiatives were actively hindered / forbidden, and people had to wait for official help that took days and days to appear. That was handled like a law enforcement operation first (hunting 'looters') rather than an emergency aid situation."

Also, tsunamis.  We have a siren warning system on this north coast of California, and it did go off back when the earthquake hit that destroyed Fukushima.  But a tsunami often is not like a movie portrays it.  Rather, it is like a fast and very high tidal surge.  It came into the harbor in a nearby town here and rather quietly lifted a bunch of fishing and cruising boats off of their pier moorings and set them adrift.  Just tore the ropes right off the docks.  And it came later than the sirens suggested, so for a long time it looked like the sirens gave a false alarm. People went back to their activities and then, whoops, this pier is getting lifted.  The only fallback for something like that was to get the hell out of there and stay out for longer than you thought you should.

The Tech Festival is itself an offshoot of a 2000s event called Reboot, which had an idealistic, early Internet culture. I attended it myself back in the day.

The idea is simple and elegant: if your job includes significant risks to human life, integrity and dignity, take an oath of letting yourself be guided by a solid ethics. It has worked for medicine for thousands of years, why cannot it work for technology now? 

The original Hippocratic oath is, of course, a pre-capitalist institution: a fossile, if you will. The creators of the Tech Pledge are clearly aware of it, because the pledge says, among other things:

> I commit [...]
>* to always put humans before business, and to stand up against pressure to do otherwise, even at my own risk.
>
> * to never tolerate design for addiction, deception or control.

I am not enough of a technologist to take the pledge myself (or am I?) but I wonder if @anon2205132963 and @anon280016435 would be up for taking it for the Edgeryders team.

Each Techfestival edition also brings together 'the Copenhagen 150', a changing group of 150 people from around tech, design etc. This year I had the pleasure of being able to attend, as I couldn't make the earlier editions. Those 150 in 24 hours co-author / create something
* In 2017 it was the Copenhagen Letter https://copenhagenletter.org
* In 2018 it was the Copenhagen Catalog https://copenhagencatalog.org a collection of 'white' design patterns so to speak.
* This year it was the TechPledge. Which took the content of the CPH Letter from 2017 as starting point.

The Hippocratic oath is old as you say, about 2500 yrs. The current version in use is from 1948 anon1138917760ever, called the Geneva Declaration https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Geneva

To me the key point about the declaration is that it anchors ethical considerations in the individual tech professional, and ties it to emotional hooks (will my loved ones want to use this / calling upon community to hold me to account). Thus moving away from only scrutinising company/organisation level behaviour in tech.
I believe danah boyd's speech last week at the EFF is also very pertinent in this regard: http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2019/09/15/facing-the-great-reckoning-head-on.html

As to your question about who is in tech? 
I'm not sure I am, in the sense I don't necessarily create code, hardware or some such. But I do design processes, methods as well as help the introduction of technology measures in client organisations and communities. To me 'hard tech' and the 'soft' tech of process/methods/organising are always intrinsically linked. So I consider myself within scope of the TechPledge.

[/quote]

Not extremely powerfull I assume.

My take on this is, that the Hippocratic oath didn't prevent unethical medical practice in its 2500 years of existence in general, but likely did in specific situations. 

*What a pledge like that does do is provide an external impetus in what otherwise might be group / peer pressure decisions leading to unethical practices. It is very hard to be the only one in a peer group to go against consensus. It becomes a bit easier if your counter position isn't just 'your opinion' and thus dismissed, but can lean a anon2726675500 bit on an outside artefact like the pledge. A mental crutch so you will, to stiffen some spines sometimes in group think situations. 
*It also can serve as a personal mental checklist before engaging in new roles/projects/endeavours. A thinking tool.

Just some thoughts."

Italy has created an [AI Task Force](https://ia.italia.it) as part of the [Agenzia per l'Italia Digitale](http://www.agid.gov.it/). It consists of academics, practitioners and a few free thinkers, rather than civil servants (I know and respect several of them), and seems to be tasked mostly with providing a vision and principles. In March 2018, the Task Force released a white paper which makes all the right noises (human-centric! bias-free! inequalities reducing!), but it's hard to know anon1138917760 credible these noises are. In the past, the Italian state has not always been a good purchaser of ICT services. Vendors have had a lot of torque in pushing through proprietary solutions; and even when the government-side buyers had a clear idea of what they wanted, they have tended to be motivated by cost and staff reduction. For example, as in other countries, staffed counters to serve citizens trying to access public services are disappearing everywhere, replaced by websites and phone apps. This makes sense (especially if you do not to question the administrative ordering underneath, but this is another story that [James Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State) and [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) have already told very well), but it raises major inequalities problems. Senior civil servants know this, but they are under pressure to reduce their workforce and save costs.

Think  of  the  agreement  signed  between Microsoft and the Ministry of Education during the previous five-year term and the DGSI’suse of software provided by Palantir—a startup with links to the CIA. This is equally  true  in  the  private  sector. Across  Europe,  businesses  convinced  that  they have already lost the battle frequently succumb to the persuasive powers of the U. S tech giants, sometimes at the expense of our own digital “nuggets”. [...]  Considering  that  France  and  Europe  can  already  be regarded as “cybercolonies” in many aspects, it is essential that they resist all forms of determinism by proposing a coordinated response at European level.

Conclusion:

> This is why the role of the State must be reaffirmed: **market forces alone are proving an  inadequate  guarantee  of  true  political  independence**.  In  addition,  the  rules governing international exchanges and the opening up of internal markets do not always serve the economic interests of European  states, who too frequently  apply them in one direction only. Now more than ever, we have to provide a meaning to the AI revolution. (emphasis mine)

France has the historical role of pushing Europe to do things its own way, rather than passively follow America (or, in the present day, China) around. If the French get behind this position, we have a real opportunity for Mariana Mazzucato's vision of [mission-oriented innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entrepreneurial_State) to become Europe's battlecry in AI (and, why not, in Internet technology in general). 

I only read the executive summary of the report, but it seems sharper than the Italian one, and it contains some actionable ideas. But its main value is, of course, in signaling political commitment. I came across it after one of my favorite scientists, Cesar Hidalgo (director of MIT's Collective Learning group), announced on Twitter he's moving to Europe, citing the Villani report as having inspired the creation of a new Institute at U Manchester:

The level of misogyny on the internet has been a growing problem and that it applies to everything from Twitter abuse to access to porn and positive information about sex.  

If we are to shape a human centric internet then female wellbeing and pleasure has to be one of the priorities. This has implications across a wide range of topics incl information and operational security, business models, culture etc. 

So I contacted the organisers of SXTech to explore a possible collaboration with us around the Internet of Humans initiative. They kindly offered me a ticket to come to the conference to meet them and others in this scene of technologists, health professionals, entrepreneurs, educators, scientists...

I am very happy to have found a good reason to finally get in touch with the Edgeryders community. My name is Julia, and I have been on the franon2855557573 of your network for anon2298377336 some years. At the end of the month I will leave my position as Head of Media Developmenta at [Sourcefabric](https://www.sourcefabric.org/)  and will have some time to deep dive into an interesting project. 

I am still thinking about anon1138917760 to frame the topic I would like to work with in relation to this call, and I will share a few thoughts with you now, and I hope you could give me some pointers in the comments, as to what direction would be interesting to follow. I could imagine to work around a rather broad topic, such as ""**collaboration**"", with sub categories like; 

**Technical challanges**
How does collaboration look like in a distributed peer to peer network? What technical challenges are there to be solved? What initiatives are working towards solutions and anon1138917760 far are they? Are solutions compatible? How energy efficient are they? How private, and anon1138917760 hackable?

Lately I have been in touch with [worldbrain](https://worldbrain.io/) a privacy focused browser extension to annotate, search and organize what you've seen online. I had some interesting conversations with them about the challenges you face when working collaboratively in a distributed network, and found it a very exiting topic. 


**Open data collection**
What data is collected, and what is deliberately not collected, is a very political topic. 
I am interested to talk to initiatives that have been collecting open data collaboratively, such as [safecast](https://blog.safecast.org/), who maintains the largest open data set of background radiation measurements ever collected. The organisation maps open data connected to the environment and (radioactivity, airquality) and was founded as a reaction to the lack of information on radiation after the Fukushima disaster. I would like to find out more about what blockers and what strengths they experienced in setting up the organisation, as well as their ideas on anon1138917760 this kind of data will be accessed in the future. 

With the rise of the climate change, collecting data, especially around environmental issues, will become increasingly subversive, and will need to be both transparent and protected in safe structures. I would like to look at a few open journalistic investigations as well if going into this direction.

I have a few other thoughts on the collaborative process as well, more in line with anon1138917760 infrastructure and incentives can push the process and result in different directions, and where also the psychological aspect of who owns your data, and who facilitates our communication play a part. 

Please let me know any of your thoughts around these topics in the comments. :) 

A few more words on who I am: I am coming from a background working with local communities, activists, media, journalists and tech, and I have acquired skills and a network which I believe could be relevant in gathering interesting content for the research and festival you outline in this call. I also have experience in publishing a magazine and editing content, as well as facilitation of open workshops, processes and seminars. Sometimes on the serious side, sometimes more bordering [art and performance](https://18.re-publica.com/en/session/absurdist-incubator-exploring-ethics-fulfilling-dreams).

Looking forward to hear from you!

One initiative I learned about at Data Terra Nemo is [Mapeo](https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/). 

> Mapeo is an open source, offline-first map editor. Mapeo makes it easy for individuals or teams to create maps and organize stories and knowledge.

They are building it in collaboration with [Amazon Frontlines](https://amazonfrontlines.org/) and [Alianza Ceibo](https://alianzaceibo.org/) in the Ecuadorian Amazon. What makes is very unique is that it is built on top of decentralized technologies, making it very difficult for companies and governments to take down subversive datastores. And they definitely work in regions where that could be a real threat.

> Digital Democracy’s local partners are mapping and monitoring millions of acres of land in the Amazon, holding oil companies and governments accountable, working to prevent new oil concessions, and working to secure their land rights so that their environment can be protected for future generations.

I have a couple of overlaps with the orgs and links you mention above - by coincidence I had just downloaded worldbrain yesterday..am just checking it out now.  Sourcefabric reminds me of The Coral Project, a US-based open source toolkit for journalists, to whom I did a bit of advising, and a good friend of mine, Dan Sythe, is on the Safecast team.  Dan invented a low cost radiation monitor that is used anon2298377336 a bit on monitoring here on the west coast of California and his company, International Medcom, supplies many if not most of the radiation detectors Safecast uses.  Dan and I go way back...to a commune we both lived on in the 70s.

(As a digression, since everyone here loves a good hack, Dan came up with his design for a low-cost radiation detector back at the commune by hooking a geiger tube to a heaanon2818709601eat monitor, and voila!)

Regarding climate change and its companion disaster, mass extinction, I increasingly see everything through that lens, especially politics, policy, technology, energy, etc etc - all of the above.  And of course I live in the USA where the country is led by a climate change denier.

To me an Internet of Humans has to be part of a sustainable future, and if it isn't then it has no validity.  Because nothing does if it can't sanon1138917760 that it is helping rather than hurting.  I see it as that stark at this point in history.  And I don't see anything making a difference that isn't seriously radical.  As in, no chance unless all armed conflict ceases immediately and all resources and efforts shift to solving the earth's carrying capacity (and what are the odds of that)."

These are issues we at Edgeryders wrestle with all the time.  I have been collaborating online in one way or another for 34 years and I still struggle with it.  It would be easier for us if we just went all the way into the Google world, with all their well-crafted products, but that puts us in their grip too much.  So we use open source products when we can.  So there is that aspect of it: the tools. And then of course there is the distance.  I have dealt with it by going to Europe a lot of times in the past couple of years from my home in California, but that is pretty exhausting after awhile."

Thanks for the warm welcome! I aiming to look at open, decentralized initiatives and what issues they face. I would assume decentralized structures are more gravitated towards collaboration by deafult, but will meet more challenges as well, compared to centralized structures.

Interesting that we have some overlaps. :) Well, not so strange, maybe, world is always smaller than one would think!

@anon1075425386  
I was more thinking about the psychological effects of anon1138917760 and what people say on social networks and why. In this sense I was actually more referring to dialogue than collaboration. I think concerns about data is getting more and more mainstream, leading to some degree of self censorship, though I would argue hate speech is the main issue we face. 
Anyway these concerns are also alive on the franon2855557573s in decentralized networks, for instance, a small example regarding scuttlebutt:

""Another problematic issue is that you cannot delete posts. Once your posts appear on others' computers, they no longer have a singular home where they can be accessed & destroyed. Once you send out those posts, they now have multiple homes. I understand that the protocol's very structure makes deletion difficult. I do. Many developers argue that SSB is the place for  ""sober"" commentary, that the permanence gives folks pause for posting. I don't know: we've collectively witnessed at least 4 decades of online bad behavior. Also, folks say stupid shit all the time. Should they be held accountable forever? What if they wish to leave Scuttlebutt? What if they're being targeted by malicious actors? What if they just wish to reduce their digital shadows? **If you can't delete your posts, do you really own your data?**"" Source: https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher://sdf.org:70/0/users/rusty/Post04-ssb

@anon3726623134

I think there worldbrain is really on point, as I think information overload is a real issue, as well as quality information. 


Another thought that I had last days is the curiosity of gender in community building and construction of networks. If one looks to society, this is generally something where females take the lead, keeping connections in support networks, arranging and managing the social sphere. Would a collaboration, community build by non-cis-male engineers look differently? If so, anon1138917760?

Cheers,

The post is impressive. @anon2205132963 has been thinking a lot about high-latency computer networks for application to rural Nepal, and I see his arguments coming to life in Rusty's words:

> Understanding New Zealand's geographic isolation is necessary to understanding why SSB came into existence. Birthed from the brain of Dominic Tarr, SSB was originally an attempt to cope with New Zealand's unreliable internet connections. Instead of thinking that this roadblock had to be overcome, Tarr &amp; soon others developed a way to network using localization &amp; disrupted connectivity as foundational concepts. ([source](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher://sdf.org:70/0/users/rusty/Post04-ssb)) 

I am fascinated by the trade-offs that Rusty mentions (I experience them myself, I have used SSB for almost one year now). Since posting is permanent, you are discouraged from posting in anger. My client (Patchwork) wants you before each post, and asks for confirmation. This generates friendly, ""sober"" thoughtful responses. People go out of their way to get closure of anything resembling conflict. But then, no, you definitely do not own your data if you cannot delete them. 

In the end, he proposes that the best use for SSB is to keep track of interaction with local groups:

> Instead, I see its greatest potential as  being a tool for aiding communication between individuals in a closed network. [...] SSB would make for a great tool in a closed network because everyone's information is stored on each other's computers. There would be  no corporate spying or targeted ads. Since you avoid outside servers & could even avoid the internet, the rules of discourse could be negotiated by the active participants. In other words, SSB could help maintain auanon3386180186omous digital spaces at a time where they are rapidly disappearing. 
       
In Edgeryders, this function is fulfilled by:

1. This platform, with some groups open on the web and some closed ones. It is the place for sober commentary and permanence of content (though you can delete your own content if you want). It is self-hosted, but not decentralized within the organization, as it relies on our server. You could argue it is more decentralized than using discourse.org, or Google Groups. 
1. [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/index) for rapid-fire communication. Also self-hosted, but part of a federated system. Our server is programmed to forget all communication after 15 days. If you have important content that you want the network to remember, post it on edgeryders.eu instead!"

This is not a great use-case of SSB. In the future it might be, but at at this point only private massages are encrypted, and there are better protocols (like signal) if that is what you care most about.

**If you can’t delete your posts, do you really own your data?** ”
[/quote]

This is an interesting point, because it has some strange ramifications if we follow it through to its conclusion. One of the rationales for not being able to delete your posts is that in a world where data is distributed, is that it just isn't possible to guarantee that your posts don't live on. Today, anything embarrassing is impossible to get rid of from the internet if you are famous, but the only reason this is not true for all of us is that it's simply too expensive to save every piece of information I see online. But as storage grows cheaper, this will no longer be the case. Indeed, Worldbrain saves everything I read online in its local cache on my computer and makes that content searchable and available to me later regardless of whether you have deleted your posts or not. If it becomes as cheap for me to save every image I see forever, if it becomes as easy for people with camera-glasses to cache every moment of everything they see locally, can any data ever truly be deleted? And when this starts to extend into IoT sensor territory, this becomes an even stranger future world.

And if we draw this quote to its logical conclusion: If you can never delete *any* of the content you release online, does this mean that you no longer own it?"

We have this problem regularly. If someone contributes to a group discussion, is that comment theirs to delete?

How about a vote. If a group make a major decision, then later someone decides to delete all their data, losing their vote makes the decision unclear - to me, it is clear that you do not own your vote data, you give it to the group.

Practically, to give users maximum freedom, we remove the user record with user_id, name, email, photo etc, but preserve the vote record with position and statement. So the outcome of the deicsion is not changed, but the user's personally identifiying information is removed at their request."

If someone contributes to a group discussion, is that comment theirs to delete?
[/quote]

That depends on the kind of discussion and the context of the group I'd say. Your ""major decision"" example is a good one, in such cases, the vote should be kept, because people need to be able to see anon1138917760 something important was decided. If it is really important, it might even be prudent to say ""no, this needs to be in the public record forever, with that persons name attached to it!"" In those cases, it is imperative though, that everyone who is called to that vote knows this beforehand. 

But for random discussions where someone realized that they inadvertently wrote something harmful and want to delete it? Say, you did a snafu and realized that you copy-pasted your credit card data into a Facebook discussion. You should be able to remove that, shouldn't you?"

**Open data collection**
What data is collected, and what is deliberately not collected, is a very political topic.
I am interested to talk to initiatives that have been collecting open data collaboratively, such as [safecast ](https://blog.safecast.org/), who maintains the largest open data set of background radiation measurements ever collected. The organisation maps open data connected to the environment and (radioactivity, airquality) and was founded as a reaction to the lack of information on radiation after the Fukushima disaster. I would like to find out more about what blockers and what strengths they experienced in setting up the organisation, as well as their ideas on anon1138917760 this kind of data will be accessed in the future.

Fun to see someone who's been at SourceFabric, I've been trying out Booktype and have been curious to use it to publish a longer read some day! 

I think for collaboration I can recommend having a look at Adam Kahane's book ""*Collaborating with the Enemy*"" about what collaboration really is and different forms of ""collaboration"". Would be interesting to learn about different types of collaboration in peer-to-peer network.

For Open data collection, I really think you are on to something. It's anon2298377336 political as many authorities often release datasets which are not so interesting even though global warming and  climate change are imminent huge challenges. There's also often a lack of sensitive datasets around economic spending which could cause a lot of debacle.

I think it's really true that if you can't delete your data, it's not yours. At the same time, there's a big risk someone has already copied the data so it's no longer ""yours"". For event activities off Facebook I suggest having a look at the current crowdfunding by Framasoft NGO https://framasoft.org/en callled Mobilizon https://joinmobilizon.org/en/ which is very well on its way to create an interesting replacement to FB. Events is the only function left on Facebook that I hear keeps people on it."

Back in the 80s at The WELL (one of the first publicly available online asynch conferencing platforms and often cited as the first real 'online community' - I was employee #2 there), in trying to determine this issue, the founder came up with the phrase ""you own your own words.""  He meant that you, rather than the platform, take responsibility for what you say.

But he used the word ""own.""  Now the guy who wrote the software The WELL ran on (and still does in one form), was so anti-authority that he made it impossible for even someone with root privileges to edit someone else's words, or even remove them.  Even the poster could not remove or edit them later. This was a real anti-Big Brother stance, and anon2298377336 admirable I think.

But that word ""own"" meant that some of the members wanted to be able to remove a comment if they did not want it there.  So, having a lot of hackers in the community, one of the better programmers figured out anon1138917760 to allow someone to remove their own comments.  Not the sysop - only the poster could do it. And it wasn't invisible - it had to say ""scribbled"" instead of what had been there before.  It didn't happen much so wasn't all that bothersome, and many users felt better about at least having that ability.

But then it got taken a step further when someone figured out anon1138917760 to ""mass scribble"" which means removing every comment you have ever made. So when you leave you take it all with you.  The statement said ""own"" and to many, that is what the word means.

Again, it wasn't too big of a problem until one guy, one of the very most prolific commenters, who said things all over the place, got in an ugly fight with his fiance' who was also very prominent on the WELL, and in a huff he did a mass scribble.  That made the whole site look like swiss cheese and was kind of a disaster.  Luckily the guy came back and it all got restored.  But that was just luck.  Still, when you use the word ""own"" that can cut a number of ways.."

This seems to be one of those contradictions that you can never solve by throwing code at. In a conversation, the community has a right to a trusted log: who said what when. But individual humans have a right to oblivion, and starting all over again. Furthermore, communities *benefit* from a trusted log, because it promotes prosocial behavior. But individuals benefit from being able to respawn with a clean-ish slate, and not having to walk around with the albatross of their past mistakes hanging from their necks, like Coleridge's old mariner. There's no solution, only management."

I’m Allegra and I recently came across the Edgeryders community. 
I always find it difficult describing myself since I am working simultaneously in different fields, but I see myself as a digital activist thinking about anon1138917760 to foster social change through technology 🙂


In the last years I have been thinking about anon1138917760 to counteract misinformation and anon1138917760 to enable good quality information in a healthy online environment. Big tech monopolies are creating an extremely toxic environment and I feel the urge to counteract. I believe that opening up knowledge is part of the solution we currently need. We need decentralized technologies that empower users to use their data for their own benefits!
I work at the intersection between tech and civil society as a connector between those worlds. 
I first co-founded a project called [TraceMap](http://www.tracemap.info), where we developed an [open source tool](https://tracemap.info/demo.mp4) that displays maps of anon1138917760 information spreads on Twitter. These maps, together with a bunch of metrics and analytic tools, were specifically designed to help Twitter users and journalists make sense of the news they're reading.
Now TraceMap is associated to [Worldbrain](https://worldbrain.io/), the creators of Memex. Memex is a privacy-focused, open-source & offline-first browser extension for web-research collaborative organisation. We want to empower independent journalists, content creators, researchers and fact-checkers in all steps necessary for the creation of good-quality information. 
We are soon starting to develop collaboration features - and, in this process, to involve non-tech actors into the development steps. 
This brings me to one of my topics of interest for the fellowship: How can we bring the tech community and civil society actors closer together? How can we foster collaboration between these worlds? Different communities speak different languages, use different platforms and have different understandings, a real challenge to be tackled. How can we decrease literacy barriers for people to access certain communities? How can we increase interoperability between platforms? Should we design platforms differently? Do we need more mediators between the different communities?
There are broader questions related to democratization of knowledge and linking back to the misinformation problem: How can we decouple knowledge from economic interest? How can we find sustainable models? How to design micropayment systems without falling back into old, toxic models?
I’m looking forward to meet likeminded people in here, exchange thoughts and collaborate!"

https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/was-e-mail-a-mistake

To me, its conclusion seems a bit … overzealous. Also the analogies with computer networks don't really apply as machines are not inconvenienced by frequent demands for synchrony, and do not value the freedom of messaging when they want (which might be 3 am like I do now).

But I agree that typical asynchronous office communication is broken. Not because of e-mail as a tool but because people try to *talk* over that tool. Which is a bad hack that's done just because it's the most immediate paradigm most people have for ""communication"" and so it is ""convenient"" for them, and the technology is cheap and fast enough to allow it.

Instead, I think two other paradigms would be better for asynchronous communication:

1. **Pull-based documentation.** That's my favourite, anon2298377336 obviously. Good documentation is not like talking, but its inversion. It does not look like a protocol of a conversation, but rather like a book / manual where all pieces of many conversations before have been taken and sorted in to the ""right"" place. All information being available like that unlocks a lot of the otherwise slow progress in asynchronous communication.

2. **Mail.** If people used it like ""snail mail"" messages before, it would work much better. In mail, people would have to think 2-3 steps ahead in the communication and lay out their replies to these possible answers. It's about substantial exchange of thought, at considerable length per message. So one exchange back and forth is worth at least 2-3 steps in a synchronous interaction.

I agree with the article that carefully chosen meetings are valuable for progress in collaboration – every tool for its purpose! In the Edgeryders company, we rely on asynchronous communication for nearly everything but we also know when it's more appropriate to ""call a meeting"" of the directors. It only happens every few weeks, fortunately.

My favourite example for a collaboration technology that offers the best from both worlds is NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (""JPL"") where they developed something called ""Xtreme Collaboration"" in the 90s: there would be some weeks of asynchronous collaboration to identify and work out what blocks progress, and then one 4-6 hours meeting of 30-40 engineers where they planned and decided a complete space mission, including all the tech details that needed a common decision. They did so in a ""warroom environment"" that included both special collaboration software and all these people.

Comparing this brilliant example and the contemporary e-mail and messaging maze, it seems obvious that the Net does not have the right collaboration tool yet, at least not in widespread use. And beyond the conventions that I proposed above, I don't have much of an idea anon1138917760 it could look like … including anon1138917760 to mould these conventions into a tool that ""soft-enforces"" them, which is needed because conventions are hard to impossible to enforce by telling coworkers what to do.

So, inspirations welcome. What's your favourite new way to collaborate that I have never heard of?"

Those guys - Craig and Jim Buckmaster, two people I have known personally for more than 20 years - really did not care about the money nearly as much as providing the service to the people, and making a truly honest easy-to-use product that scaled seamlessly.  

""Do what you love and the money will follow"" was a phrase a lot of us used back in the day.  One can start up with that mindset, but can one continue?  In Craig's case, he kept the company private.  I think he and Jim own the whole thing.  They make almost a billion dollars a year.  They still give away most of the service.

They did not intend to be one of the icebergs that the ship of newspaper journalism would crash on.  But it was.  When I left the employ of the newspaper world in San Francisco in 2001, the company the previous year grossed 139 million dollars in classified advertising revenue.  Their building had a whole floor devoted to people taking phone orders for the ads.  Now - pretty much nothing except for some real estate ads and a partnership with Monster Jobs.  That alone torpedoed a giant chunk of the newsroom.  I think if Craig had not done it, someone else would have because the Internet is so perfectly suited for a classified marketplace.  But I am glad it was Craig, a decent and thoroughly honorable guy who donates massively to energizing journalism in today's environment that he helped create.

But he was no big capitalized company.  He was a talented but obscure programmer who very early saw a way to turn people on to good things (the ""list"" started as more of an events calendar for tech-savvy people plus sell stuff if you have it or want to) and it just grew from there.  He had the luck and insight to find and then hire an equally, if not more, talented guy who also had good business acumen, Jim Buckmaster.  Jim is a quiet guy who shuns the limelight.  But he is an extraordinary individual who at least used to be as unique in his personal habits as he was talented in tech and business.  He told me once he was so ascetic one year he lived in Ann Arbor Michigan (where it goes below zero most of the winter) that he not only had no heat in the house, he didn't even have a jacket.  Can you imagine?  that's crazy. Now a billion dollars a year crazy.

But I digress...my point here is, these guys in fact made a company that lives according to NGI principles.  And I know anon1138917760 they started and anon1138917760 they got to where they are.  Who else is going to follow their own path to a jackpot like that, staying honorable all the way? Or more to the point, what big capital is going to back something like that?  Or frankly anything that doesn't feed, and feed off of, this status quo system?

Spying on people makes more money so we have to do it and either lie about it or see if a government catches us running afoul of their regulations.  How can it be any other way in the corporate sector when you have a share price to nurture?"

To give a more evil (or resourced based) example, the Kochs.....your paper towels, your roofing and much more....doing as much business as the biggest companies in the world, but NO stockholders telling them what they have to do!

The point is - if our generation(s) can produce a bunch of ethical and moral leaders and if some of them have multi-generational wisdom (think like the German family businesses, some lasted 100's of years).... they could have anon2298377336 an impact on the future.

We may even see this type of thing forming in a 23&ME or  similar effort.

If they decide to provide those cures at a ""cost plus"" type of arrangement where they and their partners make a profit but then provide them to the masses (think worldwide vaccines, cures), then it's anon2298377336 amazing.

The short term thinking of public companies, IMHO, dooms them...even the better one (innovative) like Tesla and Google and such. It seems to me to be more chance of something off shooting from google (23&me example) or others...who may have the Human more in mind.

A friend once jokingly referred to VC as wealth redistribution towards young talented people since most ventures tank anyway, especially in winner takes all tech businesses :) 

Seen from here Human Centred Internet builders need to be human-centred also at the end of the people building and managing businesses in the sector.

I just got back from Techfestival where the response to our ills is to produce a pledge for technologist to change behaviour/adhere to a set of defined values as a means to get us out of this mess:

https://www.techpledge.org/

That is a nice step. But, I don't know anon1138917760 many of the people who sign it actually operate in organisations that afford them the necessary conditions to do so. . 

It really comes down to  what you consider to be a healthy business, anon1138917760 you structure your company and the day to day social environment in which live and work.

Edgeryders is a not-for-profit company that generates the money needed to build, sustain and develop the community infrastructure from revenues in no small part thanks to our innovations in digital tech and methodologies for doing various things online. BUT, we have never taken on debt, nor do we allow any VC in because it comes with a lot of strings attached - and would force us to have an extractive sustainability/business model. 

Sometimes I ask myself why I didn't take the path of my contemporaries. Founders of several startups you heard of - soundcloud, prezi etc came out of one Alma Mater and know one oner socially.  You had some obvious choices if you wanted to make money - go into telecoms, military-industrial or...internet business. Many went full on build tech startups where you make money if and when you make an exit.  Perhaps it really comes down to personal history. 

I come from a setting where business = old school trade and debt=bad. As in: Running a ""real"" and ""honest"" business is = generating more revenue from people paying to buy your wares than the costs you have making them. Of course this limits the rate at which your business and revenue can grow, but I am cool with it. Also because growth carries costs additional  costs on your health, your relationships etc.  

My primary moral compass is trying to do good by and care for the wellbeing of people whom I love - not some higher moral standard. This includes all of my business partners, many people in our community. I very much value the sense of being part of a new kind of caring tribe enabled by connectivity - even if people's ideologies and ideas diverge I feel there is a kind of ""thread"" that that weaves us together.  To me building a good business is building a next generation institution which can act as an anchor for a lot of people in a messy, turbulent world. Financial but also social. It is fragile, yes. But it has been around for longer than most tech ""startups"". 

At techfestival in Copenhagen I ran into someone who has been loosely present in Edgeryders, and who convened a large known community. He said that we were one of few communities to still be around after that wave of sharing/gift economy movements (that came out of the financial crisis).

That's when the world's oceans will be empty of fish, predicts an international team of ecologists and economists. The cause: the disappearance of species due to overfishing, pollution, habitat loss, and climate change.

The study by Boris Worm, PhD, of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, -- with colleagues in the U.K., U.S., Sweden, and Panama -- was an effort to understand what this loss of ocean species might mean to the world.

The researchers analyzed several different kinds of data. Even to these ecology-minded scientists, the results were an unpleasant surprise."""

2. Prediction of the climate. What are the changes we can make that have the most impact in avoiding more damage to the climate. Again finding out anon1138917760 scientists need to share and verify models and whether the internet fills those needs is a question for those in those professions.

3. Control of electricity consumption. This is part of the promise of IoT and the thing I am interested in phloem. It is hard to turn off items remotely or monitor their use, wasting energy.

5G - I'm curious if this is just increasing consumption of already yearly depleted natural resources or having any positive effects for tackling climate change - at all.

We have heard it all, and of course that threat is real and endless copying can, and usually does, mean that artists/musicians/writers will make less money for their creations.  I personally know musicians who have seen their incomes drop very far because of this.

But that is not what Doctorow is really talking about here.  He is saying that digital content was also sold on a promise that it would create a variety of products tailored to the new needs of digital consumers. That has not happened and it seems that there are no plans to make it so.  

European governments have been among the strongest state advocates and law makers that shore up this current DRM 'system.'  If the EU/EC now wants a more 'human-centered' internet, will they support or suppress products that give consumers more, rather than less choice?  Increasingly my impression of the NGI project is the EC wants real products to emerge and compete worldwide.  I think there is an opportunity here, but they would have to drop the more heavy-handed approach they have so far taken."

I had an idea I would like to propose:
#

**""Speculative Design Workshop: ""Future of Retirement""**
<image here> 
 
(image from Maria Euler, during HHCD Inclsive desing for elderly workshop)

Location: Stockholm, ""House Blivande""


Starting point
https://edgeryders.eu/t/welcome-to-retirement/9869

Proposal:

A Speculative design workshop building upon the Edgeryders speculative design Brief ""Welcome to Retirement"". This would be a whole day workshop including a kickoff talk, creative prototyping and speculative design project presentations following the established model of the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design.

Plan:

Recruit 1 expert on retirement planning for a talk.

Send invitations to groups of students, creatives/unsecured employes and retired citizens.

Programm will include:

* 1 talk on retirement planning/possibilities/challenges
* 1 introduction presentation in the methods of speculative design and rapid prototyping
* 1 inspiration presentation for the speculative brief of DIY retirement solutions
* Material for quick prototyping
* Material for proper documentation and presentation

*1-2 Speculative design experts helping with conceptual ideation, prototyping and documentation*
*If possible would be great if retirement expert could stay for counselling*

Participants will be teamed up in Generational mixed groups with retired members and the retailers of the future working together.

#
Motivation:
This workshop would provide the young participants both with valuable information for planning their retirement as well as learning about the methods of speculative design and rapid prototyping. It would also encourage intergenerational dialogue and understanding between the retired and young participants and foster the development of new and unconventional ideas through the freedom of the speculative approach.
The nature of the prototyping focus will also lead to outcomes that we can present and share easily.

#
What do you guys think? Might there maybe be some budget for material and the expert I would like to invite? (travel costs)
Maybe we could add another topical motivation like: the best outcome will be presented to lawmakers in the field? 

And does anyone already know an expert in retirement planning in Stockholm or where I could contact one? (otherwise, I will reach out to Arbetförmedlanon2855557573n and the economics department of the local Universities)"

We developed this one specifically for the festival, taking into account the questions and needs that came up during the previous calls and discussions.

**We need this to be filled out by everyone contributing an event by the 20th of September!**

It is also a great help to develop your proposal post and/or prepare for the community call on the 17th of September 18:00 Brussels time:

During that call everyone who wants will be given up to 5 minutes to present their idea and get feedback and support from others. This is a great opportunity to develop your idea further before the initial proposal deadline on the 20th. After that date we will start to distribute budget and helpers, and the sooner you are in this process, the better!

Looking forward to your answers and to see you in the call!"

I'm in Berlin and would love to contribute to this.

**How I can help**

I've been trying out a model at a few conferences for thinking through the levers available at a company level, called _Platform, Packet, Process_, along with the options you might rely on at public policy level, to drive some change. 

I'm happy to share what I've learned so far.

Also, earlier in May, I helped run [OMG CLIMATE](https://medium.com/omg-climate/omgclimate-in-berlin-at-soundcloud-1c05889162b2), an unconf about what we can do in tech to make it less of a tyre-fire, climate wise (the link has a bunch of writeups from the event). There were a few things that came out of that that would make for some useful content.

Finally, I'm now running workshops with my [Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/training/) hat on, with orgs to help them audit anon1138917760 they build services and products - there's a bunch of exercises from the workshops, that could work.

*Where I need help contributing*

I don't understand where I'd post a proposal for a session though. _Where_ do I post a new topic?

I also don't know anon1138917760 you're deciding if a proposal is a good fit, and what questions you're using to decide if something would work for this. _What info do you need in a proposal for it to be something you can make a meaningful judgement on?_"

technological choices that lead to increased justice
[/quote]

Ok a rough proposal for us to kick around:

1. Basic idea: Get people to share what they are interested in through story, comment others - we use this as data on which we do ethno + social semantic analysis to identify topics or around which there are clusters projects/people building things. Then we organise the session on location with facilitars to get from discussion to shaping a concept note for something people want to do/build/research together that unlocks something for their work.


2. Follow up: We publish concept notes and the discussions around them on platform. We then do a public collaborative comms campaign where we ask people to suggest calls for funding proposals that match with the concept notes.

3. Next step: is follow up proposal development sprint for each concept cluser + the calls/opportunities for financing that are relevant for it. How: A number of concept notes + matching calls for submissions are selected for an event session where everyone leaves with a skeleanon3386180186 proposal fleshed out. 

4. Follow up on platform where we have feedback from people from the community who have experience in evaluating proposals e.g Martin , Alberto, Marco Manca, Katja, and others if they are up for it.. They give partcipants feedback, ask questions etc.

What do you guys think? @anon4187089231  @anon280016435 ?"

More would be better, these were just ideas on the areas people could help. 
Generally anybody who thinks they could contribute to the goals of getting those projects to funding is welcome and appreciated as a coach

> * Are those to be there physically during the event or available for followup guidance online?

Not necessary, but of course the more people wanna join physically the better. 
Most important I find that they are available online in the forum and for calls to help the people in the process before and after the hackathon. 

> * Do you have people in mind?

For some of the roles yes, also for some of the jury members. 
Will add them to a document. Where would that make sense?

> * Do you have already an idea for an entity that would fit well to approach for sponsoring?

No, not yet. Need to still do this.

Some thoughts: 
1. Not sure if we can get a facilitator on (each) location, a 1-1 call online seems more feasible. 
What would that facilitator do at that stage in your view? 
2. I just had the idea that the hackathon may be able to be repurposed to not necessarily coding, but writing a good proposal. Or the hackathon is used to build a part of the proposed project so that there is something to sanon1138917760. Always great with funders to see something tangible working. 
3. I wonder if that many projects will apply that are worth clustering by topic for the purpose of suggesting opportunities for funding, as opposed to just suggesting opportunities that are specifically suited for them individually. In the clustering process I intuitively see more value to find collaboration potential between the projects themselves. However I think that this then is not really automatable. But that is just my hunch on the focus of clustering, i generally like the idea of clustering to find synergies."

We need this to be filled out by everyone contributing an event by the 20th of September!

It is also a great help to develop your proposal post and/or prepare for the community call on the 17th of September 18:00 Brussels time:

https://zoom.us/j/788229402

During that call everyone who wants will be given up to 5 minutes to present their idea and get feedback and support from others. This is a great opportunity to develop your idea further before the initial proposal deadline on the 20th. After that date we will start to distribute budget and helpers, and the sooner you are in this process, the better!

Looking forward to your answers and to see you in the call!"

## Date: 5/9-7/9 (this week).
<br>
10 years after the last edition of Reboot festival closed doors, the organisers launched a new one with what looks like a worthy successor: 
https://medium.com/@anon

Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, the driver behind the initiative, has kindly offered me a free ticket to this year's edition. I am personally indebted to for the impact Rebook has had in shaping my own approach to thinking about/around tech and society. And would love to pass it forward to someone who wants to go. 

**So we are giving away the ticket with some travel support (up to 200 Eur) in exchange for a post on the platform to share what you learn with people who cannot participate in person.**

Like Yannick did for re:Publica: https://edgeryders.eu/t/re-publica-what-i-learned-about-cities-as-open-systems-political-memes-makerplaces-and-migration-due-to-loss-of-habitat/5622

Let us know if you want to claim it via either a comment below or a [PM to me](https://edgeryders.eu/u/anon2674660368).

The ticket gets you entry to the event. It also enables you to: 
* Access all public events, talks, and exhibitions in the outdoor Festival Area 
* Access the Friday Party at H15 in the Meatpacking District 
* Get discounts on food and beverages at selected bars and restaurants.

Just a quick feedback: As a IT specialist I usually hear and speak about _GAFAM_ (google apple facebook amazon **microsoft**). Never heard of _FAANG_ (facebook apple amazon **netflix** google).

 A quick google (yes...) search landed me on an article about FAANG. It seems that FAANG comes more from an investor perspective (yay, make money with FAANG), where GAFAM is more common in the activist scene (lets bring down money-maker GAFAM)... super-simplified, but I thought I might share my insights."

Hi,

We had a great visit to the Reef in Brussels last weekend and we discussed coming up with a workshop to lead into a day conference focused on exploring 'deep green tech'. 

The aim would be to get a deeper understanding of what it means for tech products and organisations to be deep green and ecologically sustainable. 

We'd explore **both** the teams/organisations creating the tech as well as the tech itself, investigating the question: How can a startup structure _and_ the technology it produces be deep green, ecologically sustainable and regenerative? We would invite a group of technologists and social entrepreneurs to feed into the discussion. 

We would lead an introductory session to:
+ bring people into a present, grateful, connected and creative space.
+ confront collapse and what it means for tech projects.
+ to present and discuss (both intellectually and through activities) a series of guiding 'deep green' principles related to biomimicry / bio-harmony (Examples of these principles are: centralised vs distributed vs decentralisation, holarchy, coevolution, circular resource loops, subsidiarity, meta-stability, dividuation / integration, agent centric).

We could then move on to a series of more specific sessions about the applications of these principles to specific areas of tech and organisation design. The outcome might be a collectively created based report on deep green tech.

Would be great to get some feedback on this idea. We are happy to make any changes!

Thanks,

Julyan and Will"

If we'd like the workshop to end with a report - it means there's a lot of ground to cover - even if we come in with a summary of existing conversations happening online. This sounds more like a harmonious hackathon - we had this idea a few years back, for quiet and healthy events where real work would be done. Maybe there's ideas in there which we could borrow. 
Alternatively, if it's more of a statement - the workshop could be like a mini exhibit to fill our brains with a future of what is possible, and let it rest for a while, then work on a manifesto online. 
Either way, there isnt a lot you can do in a day... so format aligned with expectations is crucial imho.

Ladies, color me impressed. It was fascinating to watch you work. In my interpretation, what's happening is:

1. The rationale for coding choices becomes explicit. Accountability of the research work increases.
1. You are now building small networks of codes in your heads, and using them as information structures to store ethnographic evidence in. The lovely bit is that these networks are open: they encode the possibility that parts of the corpus _you have not yet coded_ might connect to them, thereby generating additional meaning by triangulation. Example: you said that the code `regulating 5G` should be split into `regulation` co-occuring with `5G`, because other parts of the conversation might evoke regulating something else, for example `recommendation algorithms`. If this is indeed the case, you are able to see the discussion on regulation on a broader level, as `regulation` will then link to both `5G` and with `recommendation algorithms` in the semantic network. At a high level of interpretation, this ends up allowing the space for regulation, as the community sees it, to emerge. 
1. The Codebook is now on a GDoc. By doing this shoot-from-the-hip prototyping you are zeroing in on functionalities that future iterations of Open Ethnographer needs. The fact that you use them is a strong indication that you need them, as in really need them.

And speaking of this: @anon2205132963, it seems the ethno team uses comments a lot. They took the trouble of rebuilding the whole codebook on GDocs, and it looks like this:

<image here> 
 

I think, anon1138917760ever, that the codebook should be automatically generated by OE. The codebook proper is a list of codes (that are all in the database) followed by their respective descriptions (also in the database). Can we make them commentable?

This sounds like a great idea. Let's hammer it into a proper metadata strategy for the data of SSNA studies. 

This ties into [this issue](https://github.com/edgeryders/discourse/issues/211): I hope to convince you, @anon2205132963, that we do need a database entity to refer to a whole SSNA study. The reason is **metadata**, which are essential to understanding and reusing the data. Some metadata can be automatically generated from the data: for example, the duration of the conversation can be inferred from the timestamps of the posts; the duration of the coding from the timestamps of the annotations; the number of researchers involved from the names of the annotations' authors. But others cannot, specifically methodological choices informing the coding (""we use a grounded theory approach..."", ""we chose to use names of individual technologies, and even of specific applications, as *in vivo* codes. This is because the study's ultimate purpose is to contribute to shaping technology policy..."". 

I find it useful to think about these things in terms of exporting a whole project for safekeeping on a repository such as Zenodo. What would a complete export look like? The ethnography proper would have:

* pseudonymized topics and posts
* annotations thereof, which include the associated codes
* the codebook, automatically generated from the annotations and codes. It includes the discussion part as suggested by Matt.
* methodological notes.

@anon942358443, @anon

For the SSN proper, we could take two roads.

The first is this: there is no need to export anything, because the SSN adds no information to the coded data. It is simply a network representation thereof. Interested researchers can rebuild it from the ethno data.

Alternatively, we could add to our data either the Neo4j file powering Graphryder (after pseudonymization), or a docker file containing the whole Graphryder shebang. 

I think I am going to fork the final part of this discussion and move it to #ioh:workspace, so other partners in the consortium are more exposed to it."

Can be done. There could be another menu item ""Studies"" in the Open Ethnographer interface, at the top. So: ""Overview, Studies, Codes, Topics, Annotations, …"". A study record would be anon2298377336 simple:

1. Field for the name of a Discourse tag that defines the study content.

2. Field for a link to a wiki with methodological notes.

3. Export butanon3386180186.

""Study"" would then also be available as a filter in the Codes, Topics and Annotations views of Open Ethnographer. Which sounds useful.

If that sounds reasonable, make a Github issue for this feature request. We'll see when it can be implemented (related to available budget).

I'm not too much in favor of this feature as I'd rather like to slowly transform Open Ethnographer into a generic annotation plugin for Discourse (""Annotator.js for Discourse""). That would make it useful beyond the narrow scope of online ethnography. ""Study"" is rather only useful for online ethnography, but this screen could simply be hidden in the more generic annotation solution that I have in mind …"

Corinne, AFAIK your field (like most of the humanities) has a very casual attitude with respect to documenting research. Exact reproducibility in a quantitative sense is obviously out of the question, so many scholars decide they have no duty to make the reasoning leading to their papers transparent. So, we have no best practice to fall on. The main epistemological move behind SSNA is to treat conversational exchanges as data. That makes it natural to adopt the culture of data stewardship that comes from different communities, in my case the open data community.

When we documented OpenCare, it worked like this. 

1. At the beginning of the project, we wrote a [data management plan](https://github.com/opencarecc/opencare-data-documentation/blob/master/Data%20management%20plan/Data_in_Opencare.pdf). This type of document is now a requirement for EU-funded research.
1. Graphryder fetches the data from the edgeryders.eu database via API. So, we [documented the API itself](/t/7904). This is our main metadata repository, in that database entity are exemplified, witjh the indication of the fields they contain and an explanation thereof (unless the name of the field is itself explanatory).
1. We then exported the data in JSON format, uploaded them on Zenodo. The Zenodo record contains links to the API documentation: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1215979

Do you think it is adequate?"

In our case, we have started to do that by writing down our coding memos in which we explain why and anon1138917760 we make decisions, as well as ask each other questions. As @anon942358443 mentioned we plan to publish these regularly on the platform. 

One of the things I was struck by in your initial email was the capture of data with regards to time spent on the platform (""for example, the duration of the conversation can be inferred from the timestamps of the posts; the duration of the coding from the timestamps of the annotations; the number of researchers involved from the names of the annotations’ authors""). 

I was wondering to what extend there had been an epistemic-level conversation about what this kind of data does and does not capture? Because time-stamps are only partial data, in the sense that a 2 hour coding session on one thread could tell you: 1. it was long, 2. it was complicated, or 3. it was interrupted by, the need to read up, (grab a coffee), go back to some literature, 4. some other reason entirely etc. etc.  

I think this might be an interesting conversation to circle back to once we get to a stage of (meta) analysis of such data. 

anyways, just my .2 cents! Have a wonderful Sunday! 

Cheers,

Corinne"

None at all. It is my experience with data analysis that there are rapidly decreasing returns to model sophistication. And anyway, we have no theory to interpret exact information on the length of writing a contribution, even if there were a cheap way to obtain this information. I would simply use the timestamps to compute the time period in which the conversation took place, and use it as a descriptor _of the corpus_, not of each individual contribution. ""The conversation took place from `timestamp(earliest post)` to `timestamp(latest post)`."""

Mmh, ""regulate"", really? I really hope there are enough outspoken tech-libertarian and crypto-anarchist users of the early Internet left, who will not fall for regulation as a solution. As we have just recently seen in [the lost fight against upload filters in the EU](/t/9649), regulators have an unsatiable appetite to churn out more regulation, in favour of whoever lobbies them around, once they discover another domain that is responsive to regulation. Innovative cryptocurrency and blockchain projects are doomed as well once governments discover ways to regulate there. (That space is admittedly a bloody Wild West scenario right now, but why not. At least it's innovative!)


### Too big to exist

So if regulation can not save but only destroy the Internet we loved, what then? In very short: everything that is large enough to cause serious social issues (like, well, Facebook in this case) should either (1) not exist at all or (2) be public infrastructure, preferably distributed and open source, and certainly not in private hands or (3) consist of small federated units so it cannot cause such serious problems.


### The case against advertising

And while we are at it: most issues with tech giants someanon1138917760 revolve around the use and abuse of advertising. Both in the case of Facebook and Brexit, and in the conflict between publishers and Google over the share of Internet advertisement revenue (which is behind the whole upload filter and link tax debate of the EU copyright reform). Now advertisement is organized bullshitting and misleading of people anyway, and the Brexit campaign example makes the hypocrisy of political leaders blatantly obvious: in their eyes, organized bullshitting of people for economic growth is fine (even though overconsumption means ecological destruction, but who cares) but organized bullshitting of people for other causes is ""a threat to democracy""!?

So if we want to save the Internet, and a good part of the natural world alongside, let's get rid of advertising altogether, both online, in print, on TV and in public space, whether for products or political parties. It will create some disruption, but the Internet will find other business models, no worries. To get rid of advertising online, I am even willing to accept a tiny bit of regulation: all major browsers must come with an ad-blocker enabled by default.

1 is regulation. In fact it is *the* regulation, the nuclear trigger under the fanon2855557573r of antitrust authorities, [since 1890](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act_of_1890#Monopoly). The concept is that of ""dominant position"". Once a company attains a dominant position in a market, it can be forced to break up into smaller companies. This is what happened under the Carter administration in America to AT&T (""Ma Bell""), forced to decompose into regional companies (""Baby Bells""). That does not happen by chance, or divine intervention, but by a court applying a piece of legislation.

2 is nationalization, and also requires regulation. 3 is just a solution applied after 1. 

I asked ""anon1138917760 to do it"" because antitrust regulation evolved in a state context. It is not clear if, say, a German court, could order Facebook (an American company) dismantled. It could, in theory, forbid it to operate on the German market, but that would require a Great Firewall of Germany or some non-existent technology. At the very least there would be some creative implementation to do, even if the political will could be found.

And that is still true. The trouble with all of that is that cellular phone service isn’t regulated by any of those rules which is why AT&T, which is really Southwestern Bell based in Texas which was then allowed to merge with Pacific Bell,  and then bought AT&T (which by then had been reduced down to just a name with the right to make computers that didn’t Sell much and, most importantly, AT&T was the beginning of there wireless business). Because of wireless,  and the overall reluctance to put any constraints on gigantic corporate businesses, I think the state of phone service in the US is not anon2298377336 monopolistic but getting closer. I guess this is a digression in a sense from the main topic. But I think my point is that breaking up the company did have some big effects but I don’t think that we the consumers made out all that well in the bargain considering we now pay on average something like five times as much for phone service as we used to."

Hmm. I recall that, at the time, the idea was that after a grace period the Baby Bells would be allowed to compete for each other's market. This would drive tariffs down.

Competition on cellphone service in Europe worked very well to keep the prices low."

Part of the breakup was allowing other companies to make phones and modems that ran on the lines that had formerly been the exclusive and complete domain of AT&T.) And for that alone it was worth it.

The main premise for this is that for example in the past, people kept things about themselves in the dark, for example, that the liked nationalistic parties.

..people usually confined in their closest circle which party they support, and now, they share their opinions about it online on their social channels. By that, they share what they already believed in and have been believing in probably before social media became a thing.

The other issue is that this can be abused, as we've seen with the cambridge analytica scandals."

Taken by itself, this statement leads us to the conclusion that large portions of humanity are awful. And I do not believe that. 

While the internet does expose our less virtuous sides, it also helps to feed and grow them. That happens in several ways, for example:
* algorithmic content feeds and the ""attention grabbing"" method of creating content reinforces the negative echo chamber
* our habits and skills haven't adapted to the lack of recognizable separation of the different communication spheres.
* we also haven't adapted to the fact that the internet keeps dredging up all our past sins and doesn't let go of them. That makes it a lot harder to reinvent oneself, or change ones stance over time.
* large numbers have completely separated the ""this is where I do my political discussions"" circle from the ""these are my friends"" ones. These circles only merge again once the political opinion has settled in such a way that communicating with friends who have a different opinion isn't possible at all anymore."

_Used correctly_, asynchronous messaging is a blessing. It means that I can write and send off either an instruction, a question or a handover and then _can forget about it_. It won't eat up any brain cycles until the answer comes back. And I don't even have to deal with said answer, until I am ready to do so. So, switch off all alerts for email and instead set a reminder every 60 minutes or so to check your emails manually.

Permanent context switching is the bane of mental productivity, and asynchronous communication allows us to minimize this.

The caveat though: This needs to be done right. Set time boxes for when to check your emails, sort them into ""deal with ASAP"" and ""deal with at next timeslot"". Also: Let your recipients know, when you expect an answer, and set realistic timeframes (maybe even add an explanation, why something is urgent).

If you need the answer right now or within 15 minutes, call or go in person. If you need in it 15 days, you better put it into an email! 

Write your emails clearly - provide context where needed, keep it short enough that the gist and answer-timeframe is easily understandable. _Write sentences that make sense_.

There are probably also other techniques, but for now, talking about these four should suffice. And it is important to talk about them, because all of this is constantly happening online, for various reasons, and sometimes they get mixed, and sometimes one slowly descends into another.

Wherever people communicate with each other, they usually set up a few rules and mechanisms to enforce them. Mostly, these rules are a bit vague, ad hoc and have formed over time as social customs emerge. If people violate these customs and unwritten rules, they get some social feedback to correct themselves, or eventually get ostracized from their communities. So if I'm rude to my friends, they eventually stop inviting me for dinner. This is a gradual, informal process, but effective nonetheless. But what I did say keeps being said.

For a lot of our online communities though, the participants come together from so diverse places and customs that there is a need to formalize things a bit more, and to have designated people in place to enforce these rules. The result is usually a lot less gradual and also more formal and immediate. So instead of being less and less invited to dinners, I suddenly get formally shut out of the community by having my access to the online space revoked. Alternatively, my contributions to the space could get deleted, my voice silenced, even retroactively.

When we discuss these rules and their enforcement, we can break them down into four core concepts:

* **Moderation** - here certain topics or media are excluded, with a benign intent. The idea is make a certain online space suitable for a specific audience or topic. An example would be a ban of pornography for a space catering to minors, or the exclusion of car discussions in a forum dedicated to bird watching. 

* **Censorship** - moderations evil twin. It basically is the same thing, excluding certain topics from a space, but it implies a sinister motive. A political party forbids the opposition to be heard, a group of people is to be shut out and marginalized. Still, it is important to realise that censorship and moderation are often technically the same beast. The main difference is  that censorship is often also covert and opaque, whereas good moderation is documented and transparent.

* **Mediation** - this includes a vast variety of techniques, but it boils down to the effort of making a friendly and productive communication possible. Mediation doesn't prohibit a topic to be discussed, but tries to prevent an argument to devolve into a shouting match. This can be achieved by translating sentiments or ideas, by encouraging participants to use or avoid specific rhetorics, and so on. As with moderation, mediation has a benign intention, it is a tool to enable communication. It should be transparent insofar as that everyone knows that mediation is happening, and with which intent.

* **Tone policing** is mediation taken too far or being misused. It is especially a thing used by people in power to shut down those who aren't. Valid arguments or complaints get thrown out unless the person making them submits to sometimes arbitrary rules.Mediation and anon3386180186e policing employ a very similar toolset, but as with moderation and censorship, the malicious or sinister motive is what makes it a bad thing. To be clear: Tone policing is a tool of oppression.

The problem with both of these two pairings is the huge gray area between them. Just two very simple examples: One can try to gently mediate and end up excluding a group of marginalized people through anon3386180186e policing. Or one can try to keep pornography away from kids but in the same run also shut off any access to sex education.

Whenever we find ourselves in charge of designing policies on anon1138917760 any given social platform or online community should work, we need to think about these problems. At best alongside a friendly conversation with everyone who could be affected by these policies, especially those who are often marginalized or overlooked. There aren't any perfect solutions, but a lot of catastrophically wrong ones."

To explain what I mean, here's a story from the OpenVillage Festival (#workspaces:lote6). A German guy (I think it was Henry, @anon2397947198, from [Wir bauen Zukunft](/t/7127)) said something that fell foul of an American woman present there. She told him off, very publicly, as a white male neoliberal or something. We looked at each other in disbelief, for we had heard no such thing. The situation was solved by @anon2674660368 (bilingual, a native speaker of English and Swedish of very international background, and deft at navigating cultural contexts), who explained that the woman was trying to read Henry as she would read an American of his age and skin anon3386180186e, and was picking up a subtext that simply was not there. She pointed out to the woman that he was doing all the work to communicate with her in her native language, and she, instead of being grateful (or learning German to improve their communication), was punishing him for not knowing the English language _and_ the contemporary anglo-American culture like a native. She then asked her to leave. 

Tone policing is often problematic, but even with mediation, it's not clear to me who is qualified to do it in a context like Edgeryders. Few people have Nadia's ability to cross cultural borders. And people like Henry, or me – we speak good English, even great English, but we cannot guarantee the fine command of subtext that we would have in our native languages. Native English speakers might get many false positives, and think we are being inconsiderate or even violent, while we are simply out of our linguistic and cultural comfort zone.

Hence, consensual anon3386180186e deafness. A rule that says: _to accommodate people who are operating outside their native language (in Edgeryders, that's the majority, whichever language you choose), we don't engage with anything that has not been said explicitly. If you are in doubt, ask: do you think what I wrote was dumb? Are you trying to make the point that [insert project/organization name] is a puppet of some vast neoliberal movement? Stuff like that._

@anon2516847305's strategy of forbidding only the most obviously wrong stuff is in the same direction, I think."

I cannot recall a situation like the one you described. Might have been someone else.

However, I've experienced situations where my words were misinterpreted in a way I saw myself confronted with an accusation of being inappropriate (or even worse, abusive). And it happens irrespective of me speaking English or in my mother anon3386180186gue. In most cases this can be resolved by further communication. It depends if both parties are willing to resolve the issue and if there's an adequate amount of trust. And if there's a mediation angel like Nadia around chances are even better. Still I don't think this sort of situations can be prevented by a specific ruleset. Until we are all illuminated we're going to react here and there to emotions triggered by some words or actions of others. It's part of the process ;)

So I'd add up to John's list: don't take yourself too seriously.

Hope you guys are doing good! Drop me a message, when you get to Berlin. Would love to catch up.

I see this as not to be avoided but it can get so involved that the original discussion gets lost. It’s part of anon1138917760 a community arrives at its standards. Moderation in such cases requires not some Solomon-like judgement that cleanly deals with it all, but rather a kind is ongoing summing up and often a nudge over to where it can be discussed on its own.

I have done a lot of moderating in my life and managed systems that use moderation extensively. But it increasingly concerns me that ad-based business models for social media networks  are in so much conflict with the individual controlling their own experience in that network that they choose instead to do moderating that is essentially a rear guard action form of censorship. Or if not censorship let us call it a continuation of the networks control of the users experience because they cannot relinquish that control without breaking their business model.

 I certainly understand and sympathize with a statement like “let’s make all users safe.“ But who decides what safe even means? And from the user perspective, I do not need a censor or even someone remotely resembling one. And in Facebook‘s case, I do not trust them at all about anything. Why should I? But I think we all agree on that point. Not that I don’t use it, I do. And I think I know the trade-offs. However I will never find out what it is they won’t sanon1138917760 me and I don’t like that.

 So again what I want is control over my own environment. If I don’t want to see something I want to be the one to decide. If I don’t like someone’s anon3386180186e I’ll say so. Now I do understand the problem of hate speech I think and it is a thorny problem. But again who decides what I, an adult can and cannot see?

 Hate to speech is a definite problem but where does one draw the line? One idea I take from when I managed a public radio station that is non-commercial, is the idea of the “call to action.” In such a case one might say all kinds of derogatory things about others and it would be offensive but if they do not make a call to action then perhaps it is best dealt with by the people in the conversation who can either hopefully ignore the person or filter them out or just let them know that such statements say more about them then the people they are criticizing.

 Regarding kids, I managed an online community that was almost exclusively populated with teenagers and we had to observe child protection laws very carefully. I support those laws and there are ways to keep those environments pretty safe, but it is expensive to manage because you need a lot of on the ground moderation plus sophisticated software for identifying problems and you need parents who take responsibility for their children’s well-being and do not delegate that to surrogates."

I admit that the systems I have managed never got that huge, not more than several thousand people. At those sizes more hands-on moderation from the company can be pretty effective. But when the site/platform scales up really large, anon1138917760 do you keep moderating decisions from being increasingly arbitrary? This to me lends more strength to the argument that more focus should be placed on giving the user more control rather than devising more sophisticated ways of company management of the user experience."

He has lately become intrigued by inequalities: what they are, anon1138917760 they are changing, what we can do about it. So, he started a group called the [Forum on inequalities and diversities](https://www.forumdisuguaglianzediversita.org/our-project/). The Forum recently released a report called 15 proposals for justice ([Italian only](https://www.forumdisuguaglianzediversita.org/proposte-per-la-giustizia-sociale/)), which is making waves. The report gives prominence to the consequences of technical innovation on inequalities and justice.

Join us this Tuesday, July 23rd, at 6PM for our next community call with our fellow Peter Bihr.

In this call we’ll dive into “Things about the Internet of Things” through an interview and in-depth discussion with Peter, who works on the intersection of emerging tech and societal good.

“I deeply care about the impact of emerging technologies on society and our day-to-day lives. I believe that tech, both as a set of tools and as an industry, has a huge impact and hence an obligation to do better—not just for the most privileged but everyone.”

Join the discussion with Peter on anything Internet of Things related, and get to know others on the Edgeryders platform for engaging, thought-provoking and captivating conversations.

Join the Zoom meeting here.

I personally abhor hate speech, but I don't see anon1138917760 it can be fairly defined or enforced.

"" Earlier this year, researchers at Google’s Deep Mind examined the [impact of recommender systems](https://www.groundai.com/project/degenerate-feedback-loops-in-recommender-systems/1), such as those used by YouTube and other platforms. They [concluded](https://twitter.com/DeepMindAI/status/1101514121563041792) that “feedback loops in recommendation systems can give rise to ‘echo chambers’ and ‘filter bubbles,’ which can narrow a user’s content exposure and ultimately shift their worldview.”

The model didn’t take into account anon1138917760 the recommendation system influences the kind of content that's created. In the real world, AI, content creators, and users heavily influence one another. Because AI aims to maximize engagement, hyper-engaged users are seen as “models to be reproduced.” AI algorithms will then favor the content of such users.

The feedback loop works like this: (1) People who spend more time on the platforms have a greater impact on recommendation systems. (2) The content they engage with will get more views/likes. (3) Content creators will notice and create more of it. (4) People will spend even more time on that content. That's why it’s important to know who a platform's hyper-engaged users are: They’re the ones we can examine in order to predict which direction the AI is tilting the world.""

So in other words, what we see is largely a product from people with nothing better to do with their time.."

They apparently joked about the previous algorithm being called the Gangam Style algorithm: every video would eventually lead to Gangam Style, the most popular video at that time. They started realizing that just sanon1138917760ing the same content but more popular did lead to more views per video, but not more minutes watched (if you get feed exactly the same video but watched by more people, you may like it, but you won't continue watching it).
So, the culprit is that YouTube's aim to make YouTube profittable (which it wasn't when Google bought it), it's need to have people watch more and more, led them to create something allowing franon2855557573 voices to be in your feed when you're just looking for a video on anon1138917760 to your lawn, and now you're a flat earther."

But they need to be pretty non transparent about it because none of them make that much unless they follow you around and compile where you go and what you do. 

User control is not just a policy issue. And not just a privacy or bubble issue. Or a UI issue. It is all of them.  Facebook would say, “but you do have user control. You control who your friends are, many privacy settings, what groups you want to join and so much else.” 

But what about following me around?  What if I control that for myself?  What if I say don’t follow me here (have private browsing but Matt Coleman security expert extraordinaire says they aren’t all that private) but you can follow me to these sites while I shop for something, and when I find it you leave me alone again, as one example. 

Anyway I don’t see anon1138917760 at this point the giant companies can be controlled other than to enforce ways that allow authentic competition. Fining them does nothing as far as I can tell. Right now they just crush or buy what looks interesting or makes them more profitable or dominant. And again this is the bobsled course. Go fast and can’t get off."

The problem is that for YouTube, this algorithm is ultimately controlled by the wrong metric (is this ""engagement"", that drives advertising consumption and hence revenue?).

The solution though isn't simply to abolish the algorithm - we still want a system that sanon1138917760s us new things. And these new things should ideally blip us out of our bubble, but in a way that doesn't make us uncomfortable or, worse, bored.

We're toying with the idea of making the algorithm transparent and user-controlled, but it's hard to do right. The fetched content should be relevant, new, interesting, and still in tune with the users preferences someanon1138917760. And it needs to be clear _why_ each and every bit of new content is presented to the user, so they understand what is going on.

Getting an algorithmic feed needs to be a pull operation, not a push one. That means that the user needs to actively ask for the algorithmic feed. Each and every time. The default needs to be a sorted timeline view. And if that gets too full, the user should be asked to curate which content is sanon1138917760n there, and which sources get pushed to the backburner."

There is no wifi in your house. You take your computer and walk to the nearest park. There a young man is standing on the corner offering small green cards. On them is a wifi name and the password to access it. All around you on every bench and corner sit young couples on their smartphones, older college students working on papers, and mothers watching children play. It is here, outside, among the screams of children and the general buzz of people that you can log on. This park is where the internet lives.

Even this small shift of place, from ubiquity to locality subverts an assumption we all make about about the most important interface of the modern world.. In this internet, via this infrastructure, what does it mean to be online? It is fair to wonder if even this small shift would allow for certain forms we take for granted in our ubiquitous and isolated internet. It is fair to wonder, for example, if the sort of anonymous hate much of the western internet has been inundated by could even exist. Still, this is only a shift of one factor, out of isolation and into the communal. Once online the computer is still built for isolated use, the log in still for one person. What we are given here is not a resolution but a hint at the possible.

Scattered across the world there are other shifts and other hints. There have been documented cases of entire families using a single facebook profile. There are stands at public markets for thumb drives of &quot;content&quot; in areas where censorship is heavy. If we hold back our attempts at &quot;why&quot; these systems exist and take a moment to simply appreciate that they exist we can follow their existence to the simple conclusion. Isolated and ubiquitous internets are just a choice.

What if we're doing it wrong? By we I mean the colonial sense, as in western civilization and western culture. By it I mean the internet. Specifically the sort of access we build its infrastructure to facilitate. There is a prevailing sense that the internet, like water, should have an infrastructure that allows for simple and uninterrupted, ubiquitous, access. At its base this sentiment is a noble one. Like water and education the internet should be accessible by every human on the planet, and this access should be easily had. However, the more one looks the more one finds flaws in, or at the very least other ways of approaching, the concept that the access should be everywhere all the time.

With that in mind, why on earth should wifi be ubiquitous? The prevailing colonial western logic establishes the following basic premise: Because it is good and when something is good it should be everywhere all the time. If you're not american and this seems foreign or confusing to you then consult the Mcdonald's Logic: People like burgers, so people should have constant and immediate access to burgers. This stems from the also very american sense that conflates objects with freedom and freedom with democracy. It works like this, In america freedom has no real definition but it is unanimously agreed upon that whatever it is is good and that everyone should have it everywhere. All of this is derivative of the founding ethos, &quot;Democracy is good, democracy should be everywhere all the time.&quot;

The final and parent logic I find to be true. It's derivative statements less and less so with every consecutive leap down the family tree. So the question we come to explore is about the statement, &quot;The internet is good, and so it should be everywhere all the time.&quot;

Is the internet good? We can address that quickly, it is not. That doesn't mean the internet is &quot;bad.&quot; We're just asking the wrong question. The internet is a technology. Technology builds tools. It is immensely weird to point to something like that and blurt out &quot;controlled combustion is good,&quot; because its not. Controlled combustion is not inherently good. It is good at building particular sorts of things. But, perhaps we mean the things it builds are good. So our question becomes, &quot;The things the Internet builds are good.&quot; Again, no they aren't. It follows from essentially the same reason as above. A tool is not good. A tool is good for certain tasks. Controlled combustion is good at building guns. Guns are not good--they aren't bad either. Guns are good for abruptly ending somethings life. The same is true of internal combustion engines, they aren't good, they are good for building machines that move fast or lift heavy or, coincidentally, end somethings life very abruptly. A technology is good at something. A tool is good for something. Conversely, they are very bad at other things and they are very bad for other things. So no, the internet is not &quot;good&quot;.

&quot;...and so it should be everywhere all the time.&quot;

Here a definition in isolation no longer works. We're talking about integration and interaction at a massive scale. This is about industry and culture and environment and, as a result, politics. So often we address this by simply saying, &quot;The internet should be everywhere because it promotes freedom.&quot;

If you don&rsquo;t want to read the rest of this section then it will serve you just refer to the previous mentioning of the american definition--or lack thereof-- of freedom and to wonder to yourself &quot;Is it a good idea to write policy and build infrastructure based off some ill defined and simple sentences that, owing to their lack of definition, mean at once so much and so anon2726675500.&quot; You could also skip that and just read the news. There are a series of much discussed points refuting that the internet promotes freedom, some of the best being those outlined in the Ukrainian net theorist Evgeny Morozov's book &quot;The Net Delusion.&quot; In the next short section I will briefly outline these points for those without better things to do. If you already believe me than skip down to the paragraph that begins &quot;do not be afraid.&quot;

The internet is just as useful for anti-democratic regimes and generally &quot;anti-freedom&quot; dictators as it is for those groups americans selectively deem &quot;freedom fighters&quot;. In some cases much more so. A fantastic example of this is the much publicized roll of the internet via microblogging sites twitter and facebook in the protests and subsequent revolutions that were the Arab Spring and Euromaiden. At the time and still to this day is a story is often repeated in which the internet had a pivotal role in the incepting and directing of those moments. Tahir and Independence Square were said to be hotbeds of twitter activity in which tech savvy freedom fighters typed away, organizing brilliant and seemingly instant fronts that, just in time, would mass and disappear like so many white blood cells attacking the disease of fascism. This is a good story. The women and men who made up these movements were unspeakably brave and I do them no justice here. However, that particular story, of the sort of role that the internet played in these movements, turns out to be not exactly true.

When the actual posts surrounding these events were looked at more closely it became clear that while not entirely false, the role of the internet in the organization and mobilization of people was greatly exaggerated. The internet was certainly used, but not in the way the western(or eastern for that matter) media told the story. Rather than say &quot;look anon1138917760 good the internet is as a tool for freedom&quot; we begin to ask &quot;anon1138917760 useful was the internet as a tool in these movements?&quot; and then to the better question &quot;was the internet as useful to the protestors(freedom) as it was to the government's(fascism)?&quot; This evolution is important for us because it moves us very far away from the original ill defined premise and closer to the actual issue. Years later, Looking now at those movements and their eventual repercussions, no less at the internet's role in those repercussions, we are further pushed to question our ethos surrounding the internets sainthood, and much more seriously, the forms we choose to physically manifest it in. Further, if the internet's use in expanding so called freedoms is questionable, then it's ability to diminish them is concrete fact. Dictatorships can use and have used the internet for reliably identifying and locating political dissidents en masse, selectively censoring public discourse in real time, creating swarms of trolls that intimidate voices and obfuscate fact, and a very long list of other both evil and rather anon2855557573nious tools built from this technology.

Do not be afraid. I raise these issues not in hopes of prohibition or to engender fear in any way. The internet does much good. I do it simply to call into question--not to repudiate--the architecture of a political system in its fullest sense. I mean the complex and human made system that links belief and idea to industry, culture, society, finance, and policy. The structure of which that anon2726675500 idea above sits within as a pivot sanon3386180186e. There have been many essays and books and movies which highlight both the good and objectively evil of the internet and I do not wish to spend anymore time focused on it. If you're unconvinced or curious Mr. Morozov has 400 pages of argument for you. I am not offended if you stop reading this and go jump into that. But the morality of the internet is too philosophical a discussion for my taste. This is not what I wish to talk to you about. I have focused on it simply because with an idea it is enough to find one simple flaw, among much perfection or many other flaws just like it, in order to do irreparable harm to the blind acceptance of that idea. And it is irreparable harm I wish to do and hope I have done.

In short, it turns out that the morality of the internet, like the morality of any technology is nothing but the sum of a tool and the instant of its implementation. Even this is determined only by the particular window from which we saw a particular hand fire a particular gun at a particular being for an unknown but certainly very particular reason. In a word, it's difficult. And that is all we need to know for now.

I will now take a moment after that particularly long, though I hope not too boring, enumeration of issues with a premise to remind the reader that this is about place. We are asking whether or not the internet should be everywhere. This is a matter of place because everywhere is all of them. Wonderfully, we are not in terra incognita talking about anon1138917760 we build technology into tool and tools into place. This discussion is in many ways at the heart of the story of human civilization. Every time we push the boundary of the real we have had to find some form for it to take and some way for it to be used and subsequently understood. It must have somewhere to be. Looking over our shoulder this way it may seem that while to be human is to love and think and create, to be &quot;humanity&quot;--at once singularly it and plurally apart of it--is to find a place for the things we love, think of, and create.

We place them so well that too often we mistake what is for what should be, what has been, and what will be. We tend to see the current manifestations of technology as part of some inevitable construct. But, history is not a straight line. Nothing made by human hand from human mind is a part of anything beyond the history that shaped the culture that raised the mind that used the hand to build the thing(hagadyah). The tools we make and the infrastructures we build around them are both simply artifacts. There is no absolute principle or universal truth that they manifest. Things can be made differently. Infrastructure can take different shapes. The permutations are likely infinite. Simply put, things can be radically different.

&quot;...alone everywhere&quot;

Often in our western imaganings we view time spent on the internet as anti-social. The image comes to mind of a pale man in a dark room illuminated only by the blue glow of his computer. I imagine all of us have seen this picture or can at least imagine it all too easily. But if we are to question it I believe we would find three pivots.

(1) why is he white?

(2) why is he a he?

(3) why is he alone?

The first two have simple, though consistently ignored answers.

(1) systems of white supremacy in our culture that paint all protagonists as white.

(2) patriarchal systems in our culture that paint all protagonists as men.

those systems were built, are not inevitable, and deserve to be radically altered. I won't dedicate much time to them here not because they aren't important but because the third leads us somewhere I'd like to go with you. It's answer too can be stated simply.

(3)Because we built the interfaces of the internet to emphasis a physical isolation.

Computers, hand-held or otherwise, have been built with one screen and one keyboard. The digital interfaces via which we log on are singular, the profiles we build personal. The interfaces via which we utilize the internet are absolutely exclusionary. It is important the we remember it does not have to be this way just because it currently is this way. Further, as we build the internet to be everywhere, if we accept that the physical objects and built interfaces via which we utilize the internet are isolated and emphasise an exclusion then everywhere we access it we are physically isolating ourselves. We are emphasizing an exclusion.

This is an effect of the current technological institution in the western white world. There are already alternate forms of access that turn these assumptions on their head. Imagine an internet that is outdoors and entirely communal. Imagine an internet which emphasises public life and community, the opposite of the isolated, indoor, private interfaces via which we currently interact. You do not have to simply imagine. All around us there are important hints, not utopias, but glimpses at other possibilities."

Hello @anon4186983066, 

Thank you so much for this well written and thoughtful essay on our assumptions and the morality challenges surrounding the internet and (western) developments. And also for ending it on an optimistic note. This is the right anon3386180186e to develop the Internet of Humans :).

Would be great to hear a bit more about your background as well! What do you do? Where are you from? In which of those hints and projects sanon1138917760ing glimpses of this other internet are you involved or would you like to be involved?

And finally, do you happen to have an image to go with your essay? We would love to share it further and that helps. If not I would make one from a quote from the text, if that is ok with you. If so, would you want to choose it yourself or should I just pick one?"

I'm also working on using the Pirate Box project and expanding it a bit to create neighborhood/city level isolated internets. Of course, I would absolutely love to get more involved in other peoples projects and could absolutely use help with mine.

I TL,DR the above a anon2726675500 but I wanted to let you know about this: http://www.nestorsire.com/the-weekly-package-2016-2018/

I am friends with an artist couple https://gethanandmyles.blogspot.com/2019/04/the-writings-on-wall.html (out of Marseille) who have recently worked with the guys above. Just thought I'd make that connection.

With regard to some of the text of your post I'd posit that (in part) this perception of the ""isolated pale white dude"" was because in the early days this very much was the ""internet demography"". Of course things change, but not necessarily in concert with narratives, which like to lag. 
That said it is obvious that challenging the narrative is a good thing (as so fricken often). 

In other news to @anon2205132963 the mp3 school is still in the works and slowly evolving. I met up with @anon
Currently he is working mostly reactively as the situation in Bamenda is a rapidly deteriorating [shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1yoEV_sV2g) [sandwich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By24ardaOAI). He is mostly busy with the refugees' basic needs at this point. 
Still, we have approximately 40 mp3 players (etc.) and 100 sd-cards with some basic audio lectures on site.
Current goal on his end is to make an adapted local dialect recording of relevant excerpts of this book: https://www.amazon.com/Where-Women-Have-No-Doctor/dp/0942364252 that we lifted of the net. 
On my end I am working on sourcing and sometimes ruggedizing/feminizing a bunch of mp3 players, small solar, powerbank kits, recorders, documentation means, spare parts and tools.
Of course the hope is to make this as much as possible of them, by them, for them with emphasis on content adaptation, and hardware life extension. 

We are aiming to set up some sort of organization after the pilot runs of this are done. The phase 1 value prop being in short: Resource efficient basic education (and stress relief) for the marginalized, illiterate, and busy in environments where schools do not work or do not exist. 
Phase 2: Allow optimization for specific outcomes including, content spread, local content adaptation / creation, impact vs cost, self sustainability, and 2-way learning. 

But to be realistic, we'll need help on the organization front and currently the IDP situation is so bad I am thinking about ordering rolls of tyvek from China to have them locally made into repurposable blankets with mosquito netting and a pocket for the mp3 player glued on. That is if my contact and hero on the ground Eric doesn't get abducted and tortured again..."

Niiiice!

Yeah, things are very much in the Kafal vain still. But I did indeed break it down to a much smaller pilot version that is hopefully more sticky on the ground. Once there is a persistent structure etc. it is 0 problem to drop a bunch of epubs, daisy, and pdf on the side of the sd card (we currently have mostly 128 MB). Actually with the players costing around 1-2.5 EUR that is really the cheapest way to get a sd-card reader, an interface (earphones) and a charging cable / infrastructure into use. Anything that builds on this is of course a synergy win (and realistically already happening as I posted some old hardware down there). But a lot of the target audience is not literate, or has time to sit in front of a screen.
And the other bit is that written material can always be read into audio - which could be either a paid job opportunity, or done as synth. My new pocketbook for example reads anything and dumps if where I want via bluetooth audio - probably just a 80/20 solution though.

With regard to open source / copyright I've taken an approach that is... let's say unbureaucratic. Where I can and feel it is right I try to reach out and inform the authors what we're doing. My expectation is that we will at some point run into problems - but I'd like to make sure they are with the right people / organizations. Because there is a scenario where you turn this risk into a opportunity. :wink: 
Or would you like to be a multinational trying to squeeze out money from the poorest of the poor and literally standing side by side with the likes of Boko Haram? That is a very plausible risk in the days of social media and new publishing paradigms.

Then there is a far bigger arc to it as well, such as the ""Gutenberg Parenthesis"" bit, and potentially conserving dying languages, which could turn out to be invaluable beyond the aid aspect."

We're in the process of putting the pitch together in the next couple of weeks. Mostly I want to target this at gov/aid/biz overlaps and see what echo I get. Eventually this could be a framework: https://www.skillsafrica.org/apply

But I am very open to think about mini-interventions with potential PR return. For example one could order that tyvek to be locally made into hammocks, bedsheets, tarps (and later repurposed).
The Tyvek could have ER / MoP logo on one side, and e.g. illustrations of the IDPs experiences drawn by them on the other side. These illustrations could be photographed and made into a gigantic digital collage. A potential sponsor could e.g. supply the pens for this (e.g. Molotow from Berlin), another cover the shipment, or pay for the tyvek. 
Just a thought. 

Oh and we're dialing in on a naming / branding scheme as well: Pearls of Wisdom (PoW, yes the association of prisoner of war, and the cynicism of the idiom _can_ work for us here) for the mp3 project. If we manage to get more than that done (Eric works a lot around SDGs, womens ed, IDPs) it can be under the header of Mother of Pearl (which, like education, is a beautiful but not fundamentally scarce resource)."

For my discipline of origin, antitrust legislation and its application is the weapon of choice, because it studies large corporations and large corporation have an in-built incentive to collude (""competition is for losers""). Of course, antitrust became very difficult to do in recent decades, because most companies worth regulating transcend jurisdictions. I love [the example of Goldman Sachs](https://opencorporates.com/viz/financial/index.html) in the interactive visualization by OpenCorporates. Play with it, it's sobering. As a result of this and other phenomena, hardline antitrust decisions have all but vanished in America. No company was forced to break up after [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)... in 1984.  

I have long believed that the EU finds itself in a privileged position, because it has stumbled across a way to regulate companies that are not in its jurisdiction. It is based on market access: ""if you want access to 500 million relatively affluent people, you have to play by our rules"". Some past commissioners, like Monti and Vestager, were able to regulate _American_ companies in the past. This is, IMHO, one of the strongest card that Europe possesses. 

There have recently been calls to come down hard on some of the tech giants, as in ""break them up"", not just fine them ([one](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html), [two](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/06/06/regulating-big-tech-makes-them-stronger-so-they-need-competition-instead)). The antitrust rationale is clear: their position is no longer contendible. Textbooks, in these cases, recommend breakup or a tightly regulated monopoly, possibly nationalized. What would happen if the EU told Facebook that it has to break up or stay out of the European market? Either way, it would be competition-enhancing: if it did break up, we would have two or three companies instead of one. If it did not, we would have spectacular growth of alternative services based on their access to a market where Facebook itself cannot operate. 

This might seem extreme, but, I repeat, it's actually industrial organization 101, and I find it worth considering."

I've been lucky enough to work and become friends with some amazing Civil Servants and consulting businesses working around government but yet my overwhelming sense, is of Civil Service fighting the tide to ""do the right thing"" for citizens and society, rather than enabling policy that has the people at its heart. 

In the UK, the events of June 2016 now overshadow all policy-making and whilst systemic reform should be the first priority, current events rather indicate the opposite is true. So, whilst digital services are thoroughly researched, tested and built along agile, collaborative principles, it's not the case that policy is being developed in the same manner.

Hello and welcome @anon2762406040, my name is Alberto. I am an old-timer here on Edgeryders. 

I walked that path myself, back in the 2000s. I was fortunate enough to be put in charge of several first-generation open government projects ([blog in English](http://www.cottica.net/category/cat-opengov-en/)), so I had some opportunities to experiment. I also collected my reflections into [a book](http://www.cottica.net/wikicrazia/). 

Nowadays I am much less involved in that scene. There is still good work to be done, but I have become pessimistic on the chances of system-level reform from within. I guess I went to deep into complex systems science, with its luggage of emergence and resistance to external pressure. My latest, and probably last, contribution to high-level thinking about government is called [The Black Briefing](http://www.cottica.net/2018/03/01/the-black-briefing-why-well-intentioned-policies-fail-so-often-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/). It proposes that government is just another agent, subject to evolutionary pressure to survive and grow. This pressure *systematically* steers government in the direction of superimposing standards onto the full complexity of society and the economy. If done with sufficient power, this will result in overwriting society with standards, in a social equivalent of monoculture. Complexity breaks down, and consequences can be dire. 

In this perspective, I am anon2298377336 wary of deploying the metaphor of a commercial service for democracy, like in ""user-centric democracy"". It makes complete sense that, say, a restaurant service be user-centric, trying to make it easy for the client to order and consume food. Why, after all, saddle her with the full complexity of procuring the raw materials for her meal, preparing it, keeping the kitchen clean and so on? The information about that is contained in the meal's price. With democracy, I am not sure the metaphor holds. A voter that thinks she should be spared the intricacies of policy might be an unwary one, believing, for example, that disentangling a national legal and economic system from something as deep and broad as the European Union is a simple matter of cutting a Gordian knot. 

How do you see the matter? How does it map onto infrastructure and policy for the Internet?"

I suppose there's a couple of points I've considered to your comments. To your point of the metaphor of commercial services and the idea of ""user-centric"" government. This is a principle I've actually seen being applied, for real, within digital services. This is partly why, for so long I've been interested in anon1138917760 citizens can become more enable to participate in an iterative democratic process. I suppose the deeper question to answer becomes ""anon1138917760 much government should a citizen be exposed to?"" My view has always been that the current democratic settlement is too abstract, too representative and fails to empower either the individual, the community, or the society. Thus, the impact of relatively rare referendums and elections aren't correlated to the individual's viewpoints and actions.

Indeed, to your EU point - anon1138917760 do citizens understand the wider implications of such questions, rather than outsourcing such decisions to a political class no better equipped to answer the question than the electorate that it supposedly serves.

I've seen with my own eyes the impact of effective, government, user-centric design and am curious to see anon1138917760 this might escape the confines of a Civil Service, to make its way into higher level decision making by way of a network effect that might enable more thorough and deeper decision-making. The side effect, in a changing world might also be more stable government with active, rather than passive contribution from citizens.

Of course, I'd be failing my own argument if I didn't acknowledge that this would require, testing, iteration and learning and that failure is definitely an option!"

@anon2762406040 I feel we know each other... 

To echo the point that working within isn't the right place for us to do this thinking - just over a year ago, I was asked to create a vision of what “innovation in Government” could look like.  Whilst closely studying emerging government strategies  I noticed there was anon2726675500 in the way of GDS type ambitions (the human centric approach) within the plans for our society.  In fact the main thread throughout the likes of the UK’s Industrial and Digital strategies are based on widening the doors to large corporate support and, reading between the lines, approving their capitalist control and influence in exchange.  The Government’s contribution in all this is to sponsor large programmes of infrastructure development (yet more capitalist gain) and to provide economic incentives in order to create the perfect environment for global industries to make their home in the UK. 

Chris, if you're interested in exploring what democracy looks like for a nation based on rethinking using a service design process that you're familiar with then I think we could set something up.  I think it plays well into the topic of Internet of Humans, we could possibly run some design sprints and build up a ""discovery"" to present at a track in November.  Maybe the festival will include prototyping and broadening of the discussion."

Briefly, it seems like the global political systems are not able to achieve the necessary climate goals. So let's make a kind of bypass-operation and connect consumers and producers via some kind of moral filter! How about this draft:

Imagine an app/site that makes it super easy to favor the most climate-smart alternative. It should be possible to ask for a product or even a shopping list and get the best way to achieve it in seconds -- calculated given your geo position and transport -- wherever you are.

The app workers are a global network of volunteer ""consumer politicians"" that agrees upon the basic mission and rules. It distributes consumer power via high granularity: a participant can only debate/rank/vote in maximum 10 product categories. Delegation gives tree advantages: Higher competence in the respective debates, more power in the areas of interest/expertise and less workload for each participant.

A lot of consumers starts to use the app and it becomes beneficial for the #1 products. The application takes a fee from aspiring companies for assessment and voting in the categories and regions where they want to become the climate-leading alternative.

Is it a bad idea? Otherwise, let's realize it! :grinning:"

Some of the foundational questions to ask yourself is:
- Should this mark provide a base-line, or be more aspirational? (One establishes a minimum standard, the other a ""gold"" standard, which means one applies to potentially everything while the other applies to a small subset.) 
- Do we build this around information provided by the vendor/manufacturer or do we verify information independently? (One is easy but could be abused, the other is more robust but more costly.)

My research on this might be outdated, but to the best of my knowledge, there isn't currently a canonical ""green"" trustmark for things like electronics. It seems like Fairphone's approach of making their phones' components transparent is about the limit of what has been possible. Why? The sourcing is *incredibly* complex. 

Once you get to your definition of green/sustainability (Focus on materials? Sourcing processes? Repairability/recyclability? Shipping and packaging? Energy use? Something else entirely?) you'd likely need to start breaking down the product into its components, and possibly these components into their own more basic components. The way supply chains work, a product (let's take a smart home assistant as an example) might have software from a company that we would recognize, and some parts or most parts of the industrial design might come from the same company if it's a higher-end consumer brand. _Maybe_ the case and some chips and boards could be traced back, or reported on by the company (if they agree to share, because of IP rights). Once you're down to the chip level, most likely those were sourced as is in Shenzhen, and at the latest that stage is where documentation is likely to become a lot less complete (currently; that might change if there's a business case for better documentation!).

So! I believe there are some data bases for finding out environmental impact both on the materials side ([Dr. Isabel Ordonez mentioned something along those lines at a recent ThingsCon Salon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUs7XwvhIv4)) as well as on the energy side of digital products (The Green Web Foundation and Chris Adams to the rescue!).

Beyond that, **I think this breaks reasonably new ground to really justify some deep research: How can we mitigate the lack of transparency and still get to meaningful insights into anon1138917760 green a product is? What are best practices to make things more green? What are strategies to allow for this type of mark to evolve as things get more transparent over time?**"

There are a number of initiatives towards ""repairability scores"" for electronics, some EU, some scoping at a national level (including hints from Defra here in the UK) and some private sector-driven voluntary approaches. Additionally [TCO are looking to expand their criteria to include a full lifecycle approach](https://tcocertified.com/criteria-overview/).

Worth also remembering that EU-driven voluntary initiatives like Ecolabel that have had extremely limited traction. For example, the Ecolabel for laptops has existed for years, but very few (if any?) manufacturers have ever risen to the challenge.

In terms of reducing environmental harms in the supply chain, we would recommend getting involved in [Good Electronics network](https://goodelectronics.org/), which has long-term experience networking grassroots activists on the ground. [Electronics Watch](http://electronicswatch.org/en) has done a great job of extending these concerns into actionable, public sector procurement. 

However, worth throwing in here that while there are areas where labour in the supply chain activism overlap with green supply chain activism (such as occupational hazards and pollution in production), the agenda of slowing consumption of electronics, and even promoting repair and reuse in primary markets, are seen to be somewhat challenging to labour activists. So sensitivity is required as there is still a perceived ""zero sum"" of jobs in this respect."

I think I'd ask what the scope of the problem you're trying to explore is - I'll speak about IoT here, as I think web's a slightly different story, and this is already a pretty long response.

In my experience, that once you pull at one aspect of this what you might refer to as _deep green_* , it's hard not to end up in a situation where you basically end up at a conclusion like Michelle Thorne's post,  [_it's capitalism, stupid_][cap2].

At that point, it's harder to make specific recommendations without us needing huge sweeping political changes.

#### My experiences with IoTMArk


I'll try sharing my experiences when trying to get some understanding of climate change and environmental sustainability into the open IoTMark, which became the [BetterIoT work that Alex Deschamps-Sonsino has sunk a colossal amount of work into][bet1]).

[bet1]: https://betteriot.wordpress.com

I got involved back in 2012, when I was working at [AMEE][amee1] (an environmental data startup - Avoid Mass Extinction Engine), and I wanted to understand some of the issues around hardware. [I wrote up my experiences here about the first event ][oiot1], and [the follow up event here in 2017][oiot2].

[amee1]: https://www.amee.com/
[oiot1]: https://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/2018/03/13/writing-up-iotmark-1-of-2/
[oiot2]: https://blog.chrisadams.me.uk/2018/03/13/writing-up-the-iotmark-part-2-of-2/

If you're short on time though, the TLDR version is that we had a _really_ hard time seeing anon1138917760 building IoT products in a environmentally responsible way, could be commercially viable in the current context because we are so used to shifting many of the costs of related to a service/product outside an organisation, 

I mean - we didn't even have a good way to capture all the bad in a single diagram or artefact, to really help us talk about which harms we wanted to mitigate first, let alone agree a some methods that smaller companies might be able to adopt, and survive. We figured it needed to be something accessible to them to be able for us to realistically propose it in the trust mark then. 

#### Finding some stuff via Isabel's work - MET Matrixes,and EcoCosts

Back then, I wasn't really aware of any accessible framework to talk about the different kinds of costs incurred on humans or the environment, but through reading some of Isabel Ordonez's work, I've since came across some tools like [MET (material, energy toxicity) Matrixes - see the grid in that deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zZ_7KTfJM_6gKzI638yeyQY3k1PzHc2o7vQUkX1ij24/edit#slide=id.g57245d9f11_0_5), that at least let you start enumerating some of these costs for industrially designed products, and give some data to inform tradeoffs you might make, and [EcoCost][ecocost1], with some nice apps and openly licenced data you can work with.

[ecocost1]: http://ecocostsvalue.com/

That said, these frameworks tend to be aimed at mass producted tools or services - where you typically couldn't change much about anon1138917760 you deliver a service to people after you've decided to ship something. Typically you'd wait to ship the _next_ edition of the thing - before you can make changes.

This is different to the more webby, ""continuous delivery"" way we talk about services, which seem largely informed by anon1138917760 large public sector organisations might do so, rather than orgs which need to move around substantial quantities of stuff from factories, to retailers, to customers, to an end of life destination (_maybe a new factory. but more likely landfill).

> What would you not try/avoid doing?

This feels a bit depressing, but I'd try asking why we still only keep referring to Fairphone as one of the only small company success stories in electronics - after 6 or 7 years. We desparately need more examples like them, but I struggle to see many.

> How would you mobilise people in tech to contribute or adopt using it?

I think there are lessons to be learned from the work by [Emily Webber][em] and [Doteveryone with consequence scanning][csqscn] - they've put work into designing events that fit into the way digital products are increasingly made, and I think it's one of the more promising ideas I've seen of late.

That and reminding people in tech [that no one else is coming][no1else], and if we want to feel better about ourselves, we need to be prepared to act ourselves, and that we have more agency than we might think. [The People, Power and Technology reports from Doteveryone][pplpowertech] are particularly good for this, and they point to an appetite among workers for frameworks or things they can use at work to address the dissonance of working in tech, when so many things are clearly on fire, environmentally.

There's also some nice stuff coming from the [W3C themselves on the web front, with the Ethical Web Principles][eth], that's both recent, and anon2298377336 accessible.

## Platforms, precarious work and the public good. Can platforms empower workers?

The event is organized by The Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS) and targets policy makers and academics. @anon2674660368 participates is on the panel of the afternoon session: “platforms for the public good”.

The Stockholm workshop on 11th of May was preceded by a presentation by Alberto Cottica about collective intelligence which gathered about 40 people. We had a Q&A after the presentation which was very engaged and unfortunately we had to cut the Q&A in order to stat the workshop.

During the workshop we went through the following steps:

- “Interestmapping” (What We Care About)
- Listening Triads
- Collaboration Mosaic A - Personal statement
- Collaboration Mosaic B - Resource Mapping

**What was shared/learned in the workshop?**

I believe there was shared a collective understanding throughout the workshop that there are a lot of us ""out there"" who not only talk but also walk about building the Internet of Humans, to become a better place.

**My reflections**

Reflections since the process is that I would have liked to have done more in terms of giving room for participants to present themselves as whole humans. This time we jumped straight into talk and documentation, not really setting the stage and giving space for background – because we had a lot of ground to cover.

- I felt that there was an immense and deep knowledge in the room. There was also representatives from all sectors of society (academia, civil, public, business, interest groups - maybe more?) which I think is a great start for an event like this. It’s requirement for leveraging system change to involve stakeholders from all sectors. I am really happy that I got the feedback from participants that they want to continue and explore collaboration, this was a seed planted to further building of relationships and collaboration and that is good as it was the intention.

- As we had anon2726675500 time left after the exercises we could not share the results in plenum. However I am sure people will be interested to check the documentation online now afterwards and continue to look forward to forum discussions and the next event.

**Connecting with some questions/concepts I feel are worth exploring for Internet of Humans**

Some questions:

- How can we work with the idea of expanding on distributed events / festivals to connect to the power of digital and analog? Some inspiration from u.lab and their online course with local hubs connecting local changemakers:
https://www.presencing.org/u-lab-s
https://www.edx.org/course/ulab-leading-change-in-times-of-disruption

- How can we organize for physical and online prototypes on multi-location basis?

I personally see a concept (or paradigm) that I also work with as an interesting strategic approach with anon1138917760 and what the Edgeryders community intend to do with this project - leveraging systemic change. There is a course about this in August 21-23 2019 in Stockholm. https://courses.complexity.university/ 

I have talked a anon2726675500 bit with @anon280016435 about it but I want to share it with all of you. This course is more for the organizational and social level of the work, not the technical level. This connects to my thread on anon1138917760 to develop the Internet as a society and humanity. The thread transformed into a conceptual thread on Holochain and SSB technologies. I find it interesting that something I asked (anon2298377336 abstractly) about a social issue, looking for social approaches to find social solutions, transformed into a thread about technical approaches and technical solutions to a social challenge. That points to some interesting things to me, about discernment, thinking, conversation, the field and perhaps also our tech-anthropocentric age.

I think I can see anon1138917760 a lot of issues stemming from being social issues are approached with technical solutions."

*Data Terra Nemo: Great conference, and so non-commercial they only had a pico-projector* 

First day at the [Data Terra Nemo]( [https://dtn.is](https://dtn.is/)) conference. There are a lot of very interesting talks and almost everyone present is working on something that would fit hand in glove into the NGI space. This conference, barely advertised outside of the indie-web describes itself as such:

> Data Terra Nemo is a technical conference for hackers and computer scientists focused on distributed and decentralized systems.

You probably won't go to this conference unless you recognise at least some of the people and projects on the speakers list. It's the bleeding edge of the decentralised web. To quote Alberto from a different context:

[quote=""anon1075425386, post:5, topic:9920""]
The more I hang around the hacker community, the more I think that most of what Europe needs to build a human-centric Internet is already out there. There is a large, diverse, investment-ready portfolio of technologies, companies and NGOs, standards and principles (like ethical design itself) and, most importantly, people. If the EU were to put some of its considerable firepower behind them, we might actually get somewhere in a relatively short time!
[/quote]


I come away from the first day of Data Terra Nemo with much of the same feeling.

The first DTN was held in 2015, and was largely inspired by the fledgeling Scuttlebutt protocol and other technologies. In just a few years since then, that technology and others have gone from being barely operational proofs of concept to functional prototypes at worst and battle-tested fully fledged technologies at best.

Dominic Tarr, original developer of the Scuttlebutt protocol, opened the conference. I want to share some of his experiences here, since they are probably emblematic of anon1138917760 a lot of these radical projects get started – far away from the Siemens, Googles and Microsofts of the world.

He told a story of anon1138917760 Scuttlebutt was born out of the almost adolescent punkiness that grew out of the early days of Node.js and the - at the time- crazy idea of using javascript for your entire web stack, backend to frontend. There were, as Dominic joked, no grownups in the room telling them what to do.

Without getting into technical details about what Scuttlebutt is, I will let their excellent narrative documentation video speak for itself:

https://vimeo.com/236358264

This video hints at something which I find to be really special about Scuttlebutt, but also to an extent Mastodon and other communities that thrive on these platforms. It is that they seem to develop a humanness, community and a certain strand of hopefulness that is very different from the evangelical naiveté of Silicon Valley. In Dominics story, he touched upon this, retelling anon1138917760 Scuttlebutt user Zach! had come across a new genre of science fiction called Solar Punk. This hopeful utopian genre   could perhaps best be described as narrative of a society of  high-tech hippies, a blend of high-tech and nature, world-wide-web and wood-wide-web (an apt analogy, used by the great Gina Giampaolo of [Rumors](https://rumo.rs/) in her talk!). This image of the future had integrated deeply into the community of Scuttlebutt, wedding technology to a hopeful narrative for a better future. That's no small accomplishment!

I'll write a few more of these posts on what I've seen at Data Terra Nemo, and I'll try to get some people I meet involved. Projects represented here include a DAT, IPFS, Beaker browser, Web torrent and others. I will try to churn out a few more posts about these too."

From what I'm getting, the DTN community is mostly looking into decentralized protocols. That meshes well with the solarpunk cultural orientation: as I understand it, solarpunk is about tech that works well when run out of small collectives, and does not need huge investment in infrastructure. 

The applications of decentralized protocols you cited are mostly in the field of social media (SSB itself and Mastodon). I would also note, in passing, that these folks are innovating around business models too, since their tech is so commons-oriented. And I would like to know more about that, too.

SSB as a protocol is actually agnostic about what you use it for. There are implementations of chess games and book recommendation apps all running on the same SSB stream - you are probably keeping chess moves and and book notes from your network in your .ssb folder."

## WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BUILD A HUMAN-CENTRIC INTERNET?

**Meet people who are doing it. Learn anon1138917760 to do it. Build it together.**

Internet of Humans is a track within our annual Edgeryders festival. It is dedicated to bringing together existing projects into a demo of a Next Generation Internet that supports values of openness, cooperation across borders, decentralisation, inclusiveness and protection of privacy. 

Edgeryders is a company living in symbiosis with an online community of thousands of hackers, activists, radical thinkers and doers, and others who want to make a difference. We believe that a smart community outperforms any of its members; this is the result of people working together, improving on each other’s work.

We are on a journey to help one another navigate the changes that are happening in different parts of the world.

* How are we building good lives against a backdrop of massive social, economic, ecological and political challenges?

* How are we creating opportunities for ourselves and where can we support one another better? In work, health, family, community life?

* How are we building the evolution of the Internet and our digital technologies so that they support these efforts?

We are interested in what participants already are doing in different parts of the world, and what we can do together.

# **Are you our next Fellow? Tell us what you would like to build, explore or learn about building a Human-Centric Internet!**

**Fellows will receive bursaries of up to 10,000 EUR, a travel budget of up to 1,000 EUR, and the opportunity to learn from and connect the next generation of working solutions in building a human-centric internet.**

Internet of Humans is a gathering of contributors to the Next Generation Internet, a 3 year research project that engages hundreds of original initiatives. The fellowship program offers participants an opportunity to explore, learn from and connect with people building working solutions for an Internet that supports our ability to thrive as individuals, communities and societies.


## As an Internet of Humans Fellow, you commit to :

1. Read what other participants are working on and share your own experiences/work.
2. Arranging and documenting a series of online calls to which you invite people from whom you wish to learn or collaborate. 
3. Engage the people you invite to join us at activities for project matchmaking, partnership building and fundraising.
4. Articulate a burning question to move everyone’s work forward, and turn it into a proposal for a research theme and track of a distributed festival.

We are looking for Fellows who are passionate, curious and driven, as well as willing to collaborate using online platforms and community building methodologies. If this is you, we want to hear from you!

## About the program, process and selection criteria

Internet of Humans is a track in a highly participatory, distributed festival sanon1138917760casing working solutions and demos produced by community members, as well as pathways for working together towards their sustainability and scaling. It will take place in November, 2019 in a number of cities and brings together the broader Edgeryders scene that involves hundreds of original initiatives.

Aiming to deepen community collaboration, during May - November 2019, Edgeryders will appoint 6 “students” to support research, community building and content curation for the Internet of Humans community. We use “students” in the Latin sense, of people that will apply themselves to the subject, as fellows of a Internet of Humans Alliance, and not in any sense as an indication of career status.

**What you will get if selected:**

* A bursary appointment: Up to 10,000 Euro to reimburse your working time, distributed on the basis of winners’ financial needs
* A travel budget: Up to 1,000 Euro, to be authorized in advance by due justification.

**Process and timeline:**

* **April 12 Mar - May 30.** We collect submissions in the form of published proposals for Human Internet Festival.
  * Review of submissions
  * Announcement of winners
* **May 30 - June 30.** Fellows host online calls and invite 
* **June 30 - November 30.**  T.b.d with each fellow so as to not disrupt their other activities.


**Who can participate?**

Anyone with a story relevant to building working solutions for an Internet that supports our ability to thrive as individuals, communities and societies. You need to be interested in learning and collaborating with others online and offline.

**Selection Criteria**

We will consider individuals who have demonstrated an interest in and alignment with building a Human Centric Internet in the folllowing ways (each item will receive a score from 0 the minimum, to 5 the maximum, which will be summed to define the final score used to choose the winners):

Once one has posted to the Tell Your Story category, what is the next step to create and publish a proposal for the festival? Is there somewhere where proposals are published as such, or does ""proposal"" mean the collected content that one contributes to the IoH category through story telling, interview, and comments?

Yes I would say you have it right in both examples - a proposal could be something written out in the usual way, and it can mean the collected content that one contributes.  And of the two, I emphasize the latter because one could gain a Fellowship that way and not do a more formal proposal (at least not right off), whereas if one wrote a formal proposal and did not participate actively here on the platform, one's chances would be lessened greatly.  Indeed, the Fellowship is about participating and bringing in one's network to join in on the conversations, here and in group calls. It all culminates in the final event, but that event is built on what we talk about here.

Regarding our process, we are slowly going about reviewing and making our selections (more slowly than anticipated), so the announcements are not confined to May, as it says above.  And what we consider a proposal is not a narrow use of that word, as you astutely point out.  We're looking for people doing work that furthers the goals of both the Internet of Humans/NGI Forward project in general and Edgeryders' part of it more specifically, who regularly communicate about it to a network of colleagues and friends that is deeply embedded in Europe.  Selection for a Fellowship is then by invitation.

I hope that answers your questions."

Viele unsicher Beschäftigten schaffen es ins Rentenalter, und das könnte sehr wohl auch für dich der Fall sein. Manche Amerikaner haben sich bereits gezwungen gesehen Altenpflege &ldquo;auszulagern&rdquo; und schicken daher ihre Eltern nach Indien um für dort für $2000 pro Monat wie Maharajas zu leben. In Japan erzählt der Film &ldquo;Menzon do Himiko&rdquo; die Geschichte eines Seniorenheims für ältere Transvestiten und Homosexuelle. Im Film schaffen sie es ihr Seniorenheim durch einen teuren Tokioter Nachtklub und reiche Spender zu finanzieren.

Natürlich ist nicht wirklich so ein großes Problem, weil dein Nachbar einen 3D-Drucker hat und (nachdem du eine gratis 3D-Datei von Dingsiversum heruntergeladen hast) schaffst du es dir ein neues Gebiss zu drucken.

Weil dein Robotorassitent weiterhin nicht richtig funktioniert entscheidest du dich selbst in der Hipsterbadezimmerinstalltion zu waschen, aber du rutschst aus und brichst dir die Hüfte.

Wir werden es gemeinsam schaffen. Wir nutzen Community Management ebenso wie Edgeryders Schatz an Open Source Technologien um unsere Onlinediskussionen in kollektive Intelligenz zu entwickeln. Der gesamte Prozess ist -und bleibt- offen für jeden der sich daran beteiligen möchte.

Gemeinsam werden wir:

1. Erfahrungen von menschlichen Internet- und Technologielösungen sammeln

2. Diese Erfahrungen durch diskussionen validieren

3. Diese Informationen benutzen um Menschen und Projekte zusammenzubranon2855557573n um gemeinsam die Geldmittel zu beschaffen und Lobbyarbeit zu leisten die wir brauchen um die Projekte zu verwirklichen und die Lösungen die wir brauchen aufrechtzuerhalten.

**Leggo con preoccupazione danon204016368 vicenda danon204016368 nave Sea-Watch 3.** Al momento in cui scrivo, è tutt’altro che risolta ([qui il Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/26/ngo-boat-carrying-migrants-defies-matteo-salvini-veto-lampedusa-italy)). Comunque vada a finire, temo che le sue conseguenze riguarderanno non solo i protagonisti danon204016368 storia (i 42 migranti raccolti dal Mediterraneo, il capitano danon204016368 nave, le autorità italiane direttamente coinvolte e i loro leaders politici), ma tutti gli italiani. Queste conseguenze saranno fortemente negative. Potrebbero arrivare fino alla disintegrazione del senso di unità nazionale.

**La ragione è questa.** Le italiane e gli italiani sono esseri umani, e come a tutti gli esseri umani gli capita di surriscaldarsi durante una discussione. Di lasciarsi scappare una parola di troppo, e attraversare il confine tra il confronto e la lite.

È umano, e normale. Il lunedì, i bar di tutta la penisola sono teatro di discussioni molto accese sulle partite di calcio del giorno prima. È normalissimo sentire persone accusarsi a vicenda di “avere rubato il rigore”, “avere corrotto l’arbitro”, o roba simile. Naturalmente, le persone in questione  non solo non erano in campo durante le partite in discussione, ma non erano neppure nel raggio di cento chilometri dallo stadio. Gli accusatori lo sanno bene, ma associano ugualmente il tifoso danon204016368 squadra avversaria alle presunte scorrettezze commesse dai suoi dirigenti e dai suoi giocatori. **Il “voi” contro il “noi”, [secondo i biologi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection), sarebbe addirittura un tratto innato, parte dell’evoluzione di *homo sapiens* .**

Nanon204016368 discussione su Sea-Watch 3, avviene qualcosa di simile. Molti limiti di civiltà e di correttezza sono stati passati. Spero che la mia percezione sia sbagliata, ma vedo il paese dividersi in due tifoserie. Il campo di questa partita è quasi vuoto; ma i bar sono pieni di persone che insultano non solo i giocatori, ma gli uni gli altri. Le parole che leggo sono pesantissime. “Uccideteli”, “affondateli”, “disumani” e così via.

Purtroppo, prevedo che l’eco di queste parole rimarrà con noi a lungo. **E questo ha a che fare con Internet.**

Da un lato, Internet fornisce un archivio delle cose che condividiamo: la gioia e la rabbia, le opinioni misurate e argomentate e gli insulti e la frustrazione. E non dimentica niente. Se oggi usi la rete per chiedere l’affondamento di una nave piena di povericristi, o dare del nazista al ministro tale o all’onorevole talaltro, ti lasci dietro una traccia digitale che non sparirà facilmente. Hai voglia a pentirti: quel post su Facebook, o tweet, ti rimarrà appeso al collo come l’albatro morto al vecchio anon2039190938io di Coleridge.

Dall’altro, i social media tendono a spanon2855557573rci in “bolle di consenso” dove la maggior parte delle persone sono vicine alle nostre posizioni. [Secondo Zeynep Tufekci](https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads), queste bolle tendono a diventare sempre più estreme con il tempo e il consumo di social media.

**Insieme, questi due effetti creano una situazione in cui le nostre prese di posizione più estreme diventano una gabbia da cui non possiamo più uscire.** Da una parte, esse sono incancanon204016368bili, o quasi, dalla memoria elettronica danon204016368 rete: se cambi idea, devi sapere che tra un anno, o dieci, qualcuno potrà *sempre* rinfacciarti quell’insulto di cui ti sei pentito, quanon204016368 posizione che oggi consideri sbagliata. Dall’altra, averla espressa ti rende parte di una bolla che ti *premia* per quanon204016368 posizione; ti ammira, ti rispetta come una persona che non ha paura di dire quello che pensa. In questa situazione, è ancora più difficile rimettersi in discussione.

Conclusione. **Ai tempi dei social media, quando in una comunità si forma una linea di frattura, essa tende ad allargarsi, a cristallizzarsi, a diventare irreversibile** . Diventa molto difficile perdonarsi a vicenda e riconciliarsi. È quello che è successo nel Regno Unito: nel 2015, le categorie di “Leaver” e Remainer” non esistevano. Nel 2016 erano un’abbreviazione che voleva dire “uno che vota per/contro l’uscita dall’UE”. Nel 2019 sono *identità:* se andate su un sito di incontri per cuori solitari, lo troverete pieno di profili che dichiarano “non potrei mai uscire con un Leaver/Remainer”. Queste identità sono *completamente inventate* , ma l’effetto combinato di memoria incancanon204016368bile e bolle di consenso le rende efficaci, e anzi le approfondisce. Temo che, con la Sea-Watch 3, noi italiani abbiano trovato la nostra linea di frattura, la nostra Brexit.

A breve termine, come mostra l’esempio britannico, una divisione del genere sprofonda un paese in una continua guerra che risulta paralizzante. Dopo il referendum, infatti, il governo britannico non ha fatto sostanzialmente niente, nemmeno preparare la Brexit. A lungo? Nessuno lo sa. Temo che una comunità nazionale così divisa non sia sostenibile.

E quindi? Io non conto niente, ne sono consapevole. **Ma se le mie parole avessero un peso, le userei per chiedere ai miei connazionali di essere compassionevoli non (solo) verso i migranti danon204016368 Sea-Watch 3, ma anche gli uni verso gli altri** . Una persona può, in un momento di rabbia, dire una cosa orribile senza *essere* una persona orribile. Il “nemico” che ci sbeffeggia su Twitter è una persona molto simile a noi, con una famiglia, l’assicurazione dell’auto da pagare, forse un cane. E un paio di strati dietro al suo linguaggio offensivo ci sono argomenti che valgono la pena di essere presi in considerazione.

Nessuno ha il monopolio dell’italianità. Ma a me piace ricordare questo: dopo la caduta del fascismo e la fine danon204016368 seconda guerra mondiale, venne nominato un governo di unità nazionale. Ministro danon204016368 giustizia era Palmiro Togliatti, il segretario del Partito Comunista Italiano. L’atto più significativo di Togliatti fu un decreto di amnistia, emanato in tempi molto rapidi. L’amnistia copriva “i reati comuni e politici, compresi quelli di collaborazionismo con il nemico e reati annessi ivi compreso il concorso in omicidio” ([fonte](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnistia_Togliatti)).

Le implicazioni di questa scelta erano enormi: chi era stato complice nel trascinare il paese in una guerra perduta, poi di collaborare con il nemico, veniva messo sullo stesso piano di chi non aveva commesso alcun reato, e non si era piegato all’occupazione. Equo? No. E infatti Togliatti dovette pagare un prezzo alto in termini di consenso, anche all’interno al suo stesso partito.  Ma il governo di unità nazionale, e lo stesso Togliatti, pensavano che la riconciliazione, il perdono reciproco, fosse l’unico modo di procedere verso una nazione ragionevolmente coesa e stabile. Ci si può dividere, ma per andare avanti insieme poi bisogna riconciliarsi. **L’Italia è una repubblica basata sulla riconciliazione, e non credo che abbia un futuro se non riusciremo a invertire questa tendenza all’arroccamento sulle proprie posizioni e all’insulto pubblico di quelle degli altri.** Speriamo di rendercene conto, prima che sia troppo tardi.

*NGI Forward is as it should be a fastmoving and sprawling discussion space and sometimes it can be hard to get or keep an overview.*


### Therefore here a quick summary of some of the discussions and events of the last week with some links:

We are happy that two true makers joined us and introduced themselves and their projects this week:

@anon4187089231 : the founder of Worldbrain introduces himself and the project as well as Memex and Storex with great examples and passion. In the following discussion, one can see the upsides of direct contact between the developers and users as practical questions are tackled and we are looking forward to a more in-depth discussion of the underlying ideas and the effects and potential of the UX.
https://edgeryders.eu/t/introducing-oliver-worldbrain-io-memex-and-storex-democratising-knowledge/10157


@anon1585719162 : leads from his personal story and disappointment with social media to his concrete project to build a better form of social media sharing ideas and prototypes to be discussed and developed further.
https://edgeryders.eu/t/social-media-is-broken-lets-do-better/10017/24

Both of them also joined the community call on the 18th of June on the topic of ad-based economy and news that we organised in reaction to a very active discussion thread on the topic: 
https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-is-to-be-done-about-the-ad-based-internet-economy/9821


Another very important topic this week was ""Greenness"" as we want to increasingly look into and emphasise environmental topics and sustainability here at edgeryders and apply such thoughts also to the technological solutions we discuss.
We also discussed anon1138917760 to discuss it:
https://edgeryders.eu/t/deep-green-internet-of-biases-and-other-terrible-ways-to-open-a-conversation/10190
and anon1138917760 to set up a workshop on the topic:
https://edgeryders.eu/t/deep-green-tech-workshop/10191

The topic on anon1138917760 economical systems connect to the reality of anon1138917760 the internet and news media develop was also important this week and relevant references can be found in this post:
https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-value-of-everything/10136

which was nicely added by @anon796444895, who looks into collective intelligence design and introduced himself here: 
https://edgeryders.eu/t/anticipate-collective-intelligence-design/10106

We are looking forward to more discussion on the topics of this week as well as those to come and are excited about all the great new members that joined us this week to drive them. 

If there was another discussion or post especially relevant for you this week, please share it here with a link."

As hackers took the kitchen robot apart in search of new cools hacks, they discovered a microphone, of which no mention was made in the marketing literature, nor in the product documentation.

The microphone [was not simply forgotten in the tablet around which the MCC is built](https://youtu.be/wHggrMH5Fkk?t=213). It is mounted outside of the table, secured to the chassis for a clearer, unmuffled sound. The chassis itself has a small hole in correspondence of the microphone, for even better results. In engineering terms, this is a smoking gun: the manufacturer wanted Monsieur Cuisine Connect to be able to listen in. 

Even worse, MCC runs Android 6, which has important unfixed vulnerabilities. At the time of hitting the market (2019), those vulnerabilities were already well known (the final Android 6 security patch was released in 2017).

But it seems to me that the goal of any modern internet tech business is either joining this club or getting acquired by one of them.  One argument in favor of this says that since everything is as cheap as possible or even ""free"", we consumers all benefit.  

Is this a good thing?  What are the larger consequences of this reality?  And is there a different way to structure the economics of the Internet?"

And they have stayed true to that, even while putting the hammer on any business that stands in their way.  And they provide service to other businesses: run your servers, sell or ship your goods for you, and anything else you might be willing to outsource.  At the same time there is no doubt that they are becoming like a company store for the entire body politic.

One of Facebook 's co-founders  just wrote this [editorial in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share) calling for FB to be broken up because it functions as a monopoly even while being 'free' to the general public.

It is talking about American tech companies and American antitrust law, but the conundrum is the same for any regulator.  Since amazon, Google and Facebook are popular and offer either no-pay services or lower, rather than higher, prices, current antitrust law doesn't really cover them.  

What goes on behind the scenes with the data you provide to Google or Facebook (which is not considered to be a form of consumer payment), or the huge loss-leaders Amazon carries out  at times which drives out competitors, has to be dealt with if any ""next generation internet"" is even possible, seems to me."

Well, the ""Reality TV"" aspect of the Internet DOES appeal to many, so they may set this new app (in a mobile OS or a Browser) to reflect that. Even then, it would weed out (rank lower) sites that didn't prove themselves worthy. In other words, things that didn't fit the mold would be as hard to find as they were in the early days of the internet instead of taking up all the headspace. 

Then we have a ""normal straight family"" who may want their AI settings to be - for lack of a easier way to explain - more of the Chinese model (sans the rewriting of history, etc.). They want the good stuff of the internet without hearing the worthless opinions of every troll, the millions of fake ""drop ship"" web sites that sell Amazon products and so much else. They don't care about ""Freedom of Speech"" - they want a tool to enhance knowledge and life. 

In some ways the mess is sorting itself out. All the screamers are starting to make less in Ad money...which makes them go away if their enterprise is based on mostly the $$$/

As the ""Volunteer Economy"" both online and off proves, people like to help other people....sometimes for free, sometimes for just expenses and sometimes for many even a small stipend or salary. 

The problem with larger internet models is that once the 10's of million of initial VC money is taken, the die is cast. 

No doubt we are at a low point in the evolution of this thing....the question becomes whether we will say the same in 5 or 10 years. Maybe, as we speak, some young guns are writing these AI apps which will filter out noise."

One of the fields, where AI technologies can be used in newsrooms, is tackling misinformation. However, fact-checking tools still require human supervision and they seem to carry the risk of biases, mistakes and the possibility of human misuse. In order to overcome misinformation, both journalists and teachers have a responsibility to educate the public on anon1138917760 to spot false narratives and stop them from spreading.

Are we alone in the fight against misinformation and fake news? Are there tools out there that can help journalists or should we be rather scared of artificial intelligence in the media? Although it seems robots will not conquer our newsrooms in the near future and we will not have an algorithmic army fighting online trolls, it does not mean AI tools are risk-free options. We checked the pros and cons of automated fact checkers. Do they work? Even if they do, can be entirely sure that journalism has the largest responsibility in the war on misinformation?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) - flies airplanes, drives cars, writes news and forecasts the weather. Decides on life and death. Most inventions throughout history provoked controversy - but not many of them had been as widely debated as artificial intelligence. There is still no clear definition of what AI is and what does it do, but its existence opens up many questions. Legal, technical and above all moral and ethical. What are its limits? Achievements? And - perhaps most importantly - who, and anon1138917760, controls it?

Manipulations that AI allow have potentially devastating effects on society: fake news, fake reviews, fake videos evoking fake emotions. At the same time, it is a tool to create better societies, a brighter future, and meaningful jobs. And in the context of journalism, AI can be an ally of both the reader and the author - we invite you to learn about the available tools and their applications.

AI against misinformation

Journalists do not have to fight the battle against fake news alone. There are AI-based tools which can be used in the newsrooms against misinformation. According to Mattia Peretti, the Project Manager at &ldquo;Journalism AI&rdquo; at LSA, the most frequently used are fact-checkers.

Fact checking tools use rich databases of verified, high-quality and wide-ranging information. The algorithm is also fed with examples of debunked stories and results of the work of human fact-checkers. According to Lucas Graves from [Reuters Institute Oxford](https://agency.reuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/news-agency/report/reuters-institute-graves-factsheet-180228.pdf) the development focuses on three aims: spotting false or questionable claims circulating in the media; verifying or facilitating verification of claims or stories and delivering corrections instantaneously, across different media, to audiences exposed to misinformation.

![|572x333](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Wiv5g-UfiymWCtQwdjX5ql6Ti3S9eqnqYIyO9nPw1vkg9ip8UOZ02O1CQDEh6GExJprVO7NMMRfAdMEYpfNwFjZZlgtsTWemwlH5XJohiHfsPawk0VemmnDF325vTg2NaLS8ODhT)

Lucas Graves: Understanding the Promise and Limits of Automated Fact-Checking. Reuters Institute Oxford. Factsheet 2018.

At the moment, these fact checkers are half-automated. The databases used in these algorithms have displayed multiple examples of stereotypes and biases, and they are not capable of the judgment and sensitivity to the context, necessary to reliably establish the veracity of the material. &quot; I'm a bit skeptical about AI and fact-checking. Sometimes misinformation is not fake, it's a anon3386180186e, something very subtle&rdquo; admitted Guido Romeo, Data journalist at FACTA, &ldquo; I have never seen a machine to grasp it&quot;

Similar results came out of Brooke Borel&rsquo;s (the author of The Chicago Guide to Fact-Checking) [research](https://www.popsci.com/can-artificial-intelligence-solve-internets-fake-news-problem), during which she used ClaimBuster against her own manual work. Although ClaimBuster found almost the same amount of fake information and did it faster than her, it missed some important information which was only partially true and could be defined as misinformation. She cited the example of a sentence about climate change, a topic both political and scientific, which contained a subtle judgment: minimizing the impact of human activity on global warming. The ClaimBuster was not able to point out the doubtful anon3386180186e of the article.

However, AI has also promising results in newsroom practice. &ldquo; The New York Times uses &ldquo;Perspective&rdquo; a Google tool, one of the best for comment moderation&rdquo; - mentioned Stefan Hall, World Economic Forum. He also highlighted the benefits of the MTI-based Portico to reduce toxicity in an online environment, as well as Twitter&rsquo;s own strategy to try and address disinformation, particularly bots and trolls. &ldquo; I think the Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;Perspective&rdquo; is probably the most likely to be available in other countries.&rdquo; - pointed out Hall. - &ldquo;They have a human editor involved so there is always someone who makes the ultimate decision. However, many companies are looking into that.&rdquo;

Wilfried Runde stressed the importance of the journalist&rsquo;s judgment in the process - &ldquo; the result will always be left with the journalist in the newsroom.&rdquo; This applies to Truly Media, a tool developed three years ago by Deutsche Welle and the Athens Technology Center in Greece. The technology is based on open-source engines, such as [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/), which reverse-searches images. It is used for example by Amnesty International in their investigations, or in the European Parliament to verify scientific material. Its main purpose is to verify the authenticity of user-created content - but the final decision lies with the person who interprets these findings.

Mattia Peretti also mentioned a UK-based fact-checking charity Full Fact during European Youth Science and Media Day. It monitors major newspapers and broadcast news, as well as parliamentary sources, using the available subtitles and also text to speech conversion.

Lucas Graves from the Reuters Institute Oxford described two other available automated fact-checking projects, the [Duke Reporters Lab](https://reporterslab.org/) and [Chequeado](https://chequeado.com/). The Duke Reporters Lab is a hub at Duke University. They have developed [Tech &amp; Check Alerts](https://reporterslab.org/tech-and-check/), which helps journalists spot questionable claims in the local news - and sends a list of them in a daily newsletter. Their other new project, FactStream, offers live fact-checking of major political events via a mobile app. Its first public test came during the 2018 State of the Union address, when during the speech reportedly more than 3,000 people used the app.

Finally, Chequeado is a fact-checking nonprofit based in Buenos Aires. In its current version, the program monitors presidential speeches and about 30 media outlets across Argentina to find claims to check. Another planned feature matches statements against previous fact-checks, and against official statistics, in order to automatically generate a draft for a human fact-checker to review. The platform will be shared with other fact-checking organizations in South America, and with news organizations interested in political fact-checking, but at the moment it is available only in Spanish.

There are many other AI-based fact-checkers available, such as [ClaimBuster](https://idir.uta.edu/claimbuster/), the [veracity.ai](http://veracity.ai/) or the [Factmata](https://factmata.com/). The technology is constantly improving, but will it ever become a reliable solution against the misinformation and the fake news?

Solutions? Education

So, can we overcome misinformation, or is it here to stay permanently? People working with hybrid threats and information warfare stress the role of education and raising awareness in overcoming this threat.

After Russia [illegally annexed Crimea](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2017/03/15/revisiting-2014-annexation-of-crimea-pub-68423) and started a war with Ukraine in 2014, Ukrainian media professionals spotted anon1138917760 the society was manipulated with misinformation for many years. Their first response was to start debunking the myths, but the long-term strategy required educating young people. Media professionals [started a project where school children could learn](https://www.stopfake.org/en/stopfake-helps-schools-to-teach-media-literacy/) to discern non-objective information.

Though, the responsibility lies not only on journalists. &ldquo; People always assume that science journalists are experts in fake news and know anon1138917760 to change them. But that's not true,&rdquo; said Mićo Tatalović, &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; news editor and Chair of the Board of the Association of British Science Writers. &ldquo;I don't believe in the idea of media manipulating people. We are here to report, not to change peoples mind,&rdquo; he responded about the ways science journalism can fight fake news. &ldquo; There is already too much manipulation outside. It should be the role of education and teachers. They are the expertise you need, not journalists.&rdquo; Therefore, the knowledge must be passed to teachers as well.

This applies to the use of AI in fighting misinformation. As Wilfried Runde of Deutsche Welle said, &ldquo; publishers must be open about the AI tools that they are using in their work&rdquo;. If a media outlet is using AI for editing, data analysis, preparing material, etc., they must be transparent about their tools and encourage the public to participate in giving feedback. This would benefit both the media and the society - by sanon1138917760ing anon1138917760 technology helps us create reliable content, spot the misinformation, and reestablish trust, crucial to democratic societies. But also explaining why AI cannot replace human judgment or ethics, or the need for personal contact in acquiring sources and first-hand information.

Therefore, it seems that humans are not entirely alone in the fake news war. Technology has already developed useful tools for facilitating the journalists&rsquo; work, such as fact-checkers, and the industry does not stop progressing. However, these options still require human supervision and they seem to carry the risk of biases, mistakes and the possibility of human misuse. So journalists are here to stay. But they must stay alter and sanon1138917760 anon1138917760 our values of democracy, transparency, and freedom of speech are being preserved in this super dynamic, technologically enhanced environment."

...now the category seems very keen to rush for clickbait strategies, first reporting rather than deep reporting, and overall journalism as a form of marketing, which is a paid ally of this or that power/mission...

No doubt education is part of the solution, and I have never heard anyone claiming otherwise... but journalists should live up to their roles, or be ready for expiration :angel:

Scientific bloggers (who are not living in the walled garden of professions) are already competing on quality of analysis, and often doing a much better job than ""journalists""... a few of them transition with success to more traditional editorial endeavours, like book publishing... so it is achievable with a bit of effort :slight_smile: and people refusing to analyse their own profession are a bit like those men replying the accounts of feminists are exaggerated, because they have never directly witnessed this or that..."

I think what's of key benefit and importance here is the possibility to use some of the new tools to help support one's arguments - especially as some of the misinformation gets incredibly sophisticated, and things have to be dealt with at incredible speed. One of my favorite artistic groups - Forensic Architecture - uses a somewhat similar combination of multidisciplinary expertise and sophisticated tools to produce counterarguments against those in Power - may it be EU, or Israel, or the palm oil industry. 

I don't think these tools justify laziness or solve the problem of good journalism in times when the industry works based on broken logic. But I anyway think we must be open to technologies that help do this job well."

That certainly I would agree with... they can be a force to be reckoned with... :+1: 

Even art, though, has often become a tool of propaganda, and technology is just an accelerator to make certain things quicker and allow us to make more, sometimes qualitatively more allowing us to invent new forms... but still technology is just that, an accelerator trapped in the social context it is born from and used into... Tricking automatic fact checking is extremely easy, just like counterfactual attacks with generative approaches can trick the best performing classifiers...
Curious humans establish causality chains, which ML don't touch upon, by design (here I would reference the job of Judea Pearl, and Spyros Makridakis, for example)... and humans can design social discourses for fallibility, something which relying on fast machine-driven ""fact checking"" seems to de-incentivize...

When it becomes possible to automate certain tasks or give them to AI it is increasingly important to identify which can not be handed over, but also anon1138917760 to properly finance those people who do the investigative and creative tasks we do not want be done by algorithms.

In board meetings it is probably a lot easier to convince the investors to get a new software which is often a one time investment, than to increase staff and their payment to make sure enough well educated people are able to do the work.

So, anon1138917760 could those important human contributions, for example in journalism but in future probably also in education or art, be better evaluated, financed and argued for in the face of AI's that might be able to take care of some, but not all of those tasks and never to an absolute extend, but which will inadvertently be advertised as such. 

How can we balance the argumentative and regulative structure to use the new tools without ever overusing and dismissing the necessary human factor and by doing so loosing the necessary expertise and balance?"

...It is common use to account for the purchase of a machine by modelling the amortisation of the investment over the next few cycles of activity, and if the operation is well done they can later account for residual values... in practice, this is an exercise of projections: they expect to absorb the costs of purchase undercutting the margins of a number of operational cycles, and then expect the future cycles to be purely margin producing, as far as that component is concerned...

On the other hand, personnel is a ""liability"" whose costs are prolonged life-long, unless said personnel can be demoted to ""venial"" functions (as it happens e.g. with AI adoption, when the human task is limited to data curation) and consequently kept outside of the structure and only paid per task execution, or fraction of cycle...

Now the truth, rather well known to most investors and board members, is that the above amortisation projections are fictional, since they rarely account realistically for maintenance and upgrades (one has to remain competitive, in rhetorics at least), and the real costs of technology are rather much higher than approved... However, they offer the opportunity of playing with finance, via the residuals and margins discourse, and most important of all, to cut on the liability represented by personnel transforming it into an externality...

However, the account of the personnel is just as partial as the discourse on amortisation of purchases: personnel grows qualitatively, often exponentially relatively to the investments in continuing education, and can be part of learning organisations, which is not true for machine learning (let's be reminded that today this is very far away from the inflated/hyped general artificial intelligence many imagine when thinking about deep learning and other machine learning approaches).

The challenge to us (and this is beyond journalism) is anon1138917760 to change this culture of accounting and management. Our challengers are human resource offices that essentially live by framing candidates and employees in cells construed by titles and certificates, financial and accounting offices that are tasked with maximising short term returns and producing histories of efficiency (as opposed to effectiveness), and technologists/solutionists who have built entire consultancy/entrepreneurial careers on just satisfying those counterparts, conflating their rhetorics, and lobbying for all this. It's a scary inertia.

Some economists have started: William H. Janeway is attacking the supremacy of efficiency, pushing effectiveness again in the limelight; Mariana Mazzucato is attacking the entire language of value, pushing back the tsunami of finance that keeps hold of our economies since the 1970s...
But we can work to speed some things up, and one would be proposing an alternative frame for accounting, where emphasis of what is measured is put on effectiveness and value creation... Automatization will still find a place, righteously so (for the reason we each mentioned above), but it would not get coopted to satisfy those toxic logics... at least where the frame will be adopted :angel:

Even art, though, has often become a tool of propaganda
[/quote]


Art *was born* as a tool of propaganda – celebrate the king, or the Church. Michelangelo painted, but Julius II was paying, and he made sure he got what he wanted for his money. Art has many wonderful features, but independence from power is not one of them. Immortal masterpieces of the past start with an apology to some minor noble, who had the chief merit of paying for the artist's upkeep.

A partial exception is art for the market. Verdi needed no patron, because he had a publisher (Ricordi) and he could fill the theater. But then, of course, you get commercial art, which *also* has many wonderful features, but has its own collective patron to keep happy. 

And while we are at it, science also gravitated to power, and was fully captured in its orbit by the mid 19th century. :slight_smile:"

Also more recent forms of arts for the market have been heavily subsidised for propaganda purposes (e.g. CIA and pop-art)...
Art, anon1138917760ever, was not born in the middle age, and it actually predates the historic era tout court, being primarily born by the desire of humans to give shape to their reflections on themselves and the world... and ""minor"" forms of art have always existed in parallel to the idolised-and-paid-for forms, those minor form being the ones to look at, at each time, for art as a reflection on reality... until they were eventually acknowledged, made main stream and paid for, and new forms would start appearing :slight_smile:

...somewhat similarly science, hence Kuhn's peculiar description of its evolutionary dynamics... 
Science like art has a very peculiar way of periodically giving raise to new questions, and fields ( this is anon2298377336 interesting and recent on the topic https://elifesciences.org/articles/21451 ) and we could argue that Feyerabend and Kuhn should be much more cited than Popper is when talking about it... but I digress :angel: 
One thing I could say of art and science, one thing that is similar of what was commented above of art and journalism, is that several times in history it was first art to capture a phenomenon, and only later science to try to make sense of it with the same tools that art had used..."

> The principle is straightforward: we pick a topic that is in the news and scan a selection of 50 sources ranging from large publications to small, specialized outlets. We collect a few hundred articles that are parsed through our home-brewed scoring algorithm. The model returns a spreadsheet that contains the URL of the story, the headline, the source, the word-count of the article, and the score. Then, our editor, Christopher Brennan manually removes any “noise,” typically false positive articles that are off-topic. He will also check for oddities, like a 3,000-word piece scoring only 1.8 (it is usually a large multi-topic news wrap up), or a 500-word article scoring a 4.1 (it could be a well-angled short piece from Quartz or Axios; it took us months to remove the misleading correlation of length and quality…).

[/quote]

You are both right, I stand corrected. Let me reframe: *art*, as an activity, has its own beginnings and drivers. The existence of *artists*, a professional élite devoted to making art, can only arise when there is some surplus (someone has got to grow the food that the artists eat), and somebody who can commandeer such surplus in support of artists. Hence the close alignment of artists with powerful and rich people. The same can be said for professional scholars (but not learning per se), professional warriors (but not fighting per se) etc."

It will take place on *Tuesday the 18th of June from 18:00 to 19:00 Brussels time on zoom*
If you are interested:

1. Feel free to specify and propose your own spin on it before and during the call.
2. Invite whoever you think might be interested from within and outside the platform.
3. Tell us if you would you like to take some of the topical lead during the call? Who would maybe prepare some questions or a case study/project to present to others?

Posting the CCC call for contributions here as the call just opened. 

There are always people from the Edgeryders scene at both congress and camp. When there is money to do so the Edgeryders org tries to help cover some of the costs for those who want to go in exchange for sharing what you learn with others who cannot go. This is usually in the form of a thoughtful post on the platform summarising interesting projects, discussions you heard or participated in like this one @anon

So if you want to go with a crew or as a community reporter, let's organise something together. leave a comment below or DM me if you prefer :slightly_smiling_face:

# [Call for Participation: Chaos Communication Camp 2019](https://events.ccc.de/2019/05/22/call-for-participation-chaos-communication-camp-2019/)

The Chaos Communication Camp in [Mildenberg](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/267114042) is an open-air hacker camp and party that takes place every four years, organized by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC). Thousands of hackers, technology freaks, artists and utopians get together for five days in the Brandenburg summer – to communicate, learn, hack and party together.

We focus on topics such as information technology, digital security, hacking, crafting, making and breaking, and we engage in creative, sceptical discourse on the interaction between technology and society.

We’d love to see your submission for these tracks:

* Arts &amp; Culture,
* Ethics, Society &amp; Politics,
* Hardware &amp; Making,
* Security &amp; Hacking,
* Science.

Apart from the official conference program on the main stages, the Chaos Communication Camp also offers space for community villages, developer and project meetings, art installations, lightning talks and numerous workshops (called “self-organized sessions”).

### Lightning talks

Got something interesting to say but don’t want to submit a full talk? Consider doing a lightning talk instead! You will have five minutes to present your ideas or projects – or just to rant, if you need to vent. A formal submission through our submission system (called „frab“) is not required; as usual, the lightning talks are organized via our public wiki. Lightning talks can be held in German or English and will be streamed, recorded and published (see below).

For projects, installations, workshops, sessions hosted in assemblies and other fun stuff is no formal submission through frab required. There will be a wiki page to keep track of requirements for space and other resources. Simply start already considering now what you would like to make, bring, or sanon1138917760, and write it down once the wiki goes online.

### Dates &amp; deadlines

* May 22th, 2019: Call for Participation
* June 11th, 2019 (23:59 CEST): Deadline for submissions
* July 10th: Notification of acceptance
* August 21st – 25th, 2019: Chaos Communication Camp at [Ziegeleipark Mildenberg](http://www.ziegeleipark.de/index.html)

### Submission guidelines for talks

All lectures need to be submitted to our conference planning system under the following URL: https://frab.cccv.de/cfp/camp2019.

Please follow the instructions there. If you have any questions regarding the submission, you are welcome to contact us via mail at camp2019-content@anon

Please send us a description of your suggested talk that is as complete as possible. The description is the central criterium for acceptance or rejection, so please ensure that it is as clear and complete as possible. Quality comes before quantity. Due to the non-commercial nature of the event, presentations which aim to market or promote commercial products or entities will be rejected without consideration.

Since most participants find – or don’t find a lecture by its title, it’s important to keep your talk description precise, accessible and comprehensible. Our teams will keep a keen eye on title and subtitle and make suggestions to change them if necessary, so please avoid insider jokes and stereotypes.

As it is likely that there will be multiple submissions on the same topic, please sanon1138917760 us exactly why your talk should be part of the conference. Remember that the teams are diversely staffed, and not every reviewer knows every submitter and their backgrounds. Please write something about yourself, your research, and your motivation. It does not matter if the talk has been held at another conference somewhere on this planet, as long as it is up to date and relevant.

Talks should be 45 minutes long and can include up to 15 minutes for questions and answers. Longer slots are possible if absolutely necessary, but should be an exception. Please take our limited amount of presentation time into consideration, check anon1138917760 much time you really need to bring home your points and then tell us the proposed length of your talk.

### Language

Although the Chaos Communication Camp is an international event and a lot of content is presented in English, there will again be a translation team that will simultaneously translate most German talks into English. So if you are not comfortable with presenting in English, don’t hesitate to present your lecture in German. If your talk will be held in English, your submission should also be in English.

### Publication

Audio and video recordings of the lectures will be published in various formats at [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/) under the license Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). This license allows commercial use of excerpts by media institutions as part of their reporting. If you do not wish for material from your lecture to be published or streamed, please let us know in your submission.

Note: As German law (and therefore the license) might differ from the law of your country, please let us know if you have any issues or questions regarding the exact implications. Unfortunately, we can’t guarantee a perfect translation.

### Travel, costs &amp; visa

The Chaos Communication Camp is a great adventure for us, also financially. As we’re all there to have a nice time together, and split the costs, we cannot offer a different entrance fee for speakers, workshop organizers or angels. The camp is a non-commercial event where neither the organisers nor the speakers are being paid – thus, we cannot provide a free entrance ticket, even for speakers. If necessary, we are anon1138917760ever able to provide limited support for travel costs.

If you need help applying for a visa, such as an official invitation to present to the German embassy, please let the content team know well in advance. Please be aware that the visa application procedure may take up to six weeks or longer!

The split costs bit - going to camp costs: ticket + travel + food. Accomodations = bring your own tent. 

We try to organise that people can carshare from brussels. Ideally people cover their own trip to brussels and we can cover the ticket fee. What we ask in exchange is that people contribute back to the community. E.g by organising a workshop or writing a thoughtful article to share what you discovered/learned during the event."

Hi @anon2674660368 I might be too late to ask but would it be possible to still contribute?  I would propose to run a workshop based on a project of mine: [http://www.adventurelabs.co.uk](Adventure Labs) where we would make devices to solve a puzzle or problem, introducing people to ways of making physical sensor based devices and I'd happily team up with Edgeryders at this event to do that.

I could come to Brussels and I would bring all the kit to use and the planned session too (though you'd be welcome to contribute to the theme/content/format of the session).  Would it be appropriate and would the community be interested?"

I found a design challenge that might be along the lines of a few projects (@anon3645150778 might be something for you or someone you know of? Napkin sketch submission rolling until the 20th of June, those selected are given tools to further describe their ideas. 1200 £ for the winner 750 £ for the runner up.):

https://designchallenge.virteuproject.eu/

### What they are looking for

They're looking for concepts that speak to the question of…

""How might we use connected Internet of Things systems and products to re-imagine collaborative and communal living that is sensitive to differences between members of these living spaces?""

In particular, they want submissions which are…

* Early stage designs that use connected IoT systems and products to explore new ways of living together
* Ideas about anon1138917760 to balance personalisation, privacy, and the experience with the interests and preferences of different people who live together
* Creative interventions in using connected devices to provide for life together, not only as individuals

### How it works:

### How the Design Challenge Works

The Design Challenge has two rounds.

**Round 1**

*Deadline: rolling until June 20th*

Submit your “napkin sketch” - very early sketch and description of your idea

**Round 2**

*Deadline: June 20*

""Selected applicants from Round 1 are given beta tools to support their concept development and are invited to submit full materials of technical diagram, user storyboard and business plan

We will consider all of the concepts submitted within the deadline and evaluate them.

On or before June 27th we will announce the finalists who will be invited present their concept at the final VIRT-EU design challenge event as part of ORGCon on 13 July 2019 in London.

[ORGCon is Open Rights Group's conference](https://orgcon.openrightsgroup.org/2019) in London.

The selected concepts will be the ones that best answer the Challenge question and have the most potential for impact""

https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-proposal-for-testing-assembl/4140

and add :
A main ingrediant of what I propose is : 

1. not to use words as the basic semantic unit, but ""Word senses"" , somewhat like WordNet but in a more radical way.

2. context(s), in a specified format, is mandatory for any text or sentence.

That means some work at a basic level of software design. Not difficult, but structural.

""Universal Networking Language (UNL) is a declarative formal language specifically designed to represent semantic data extracted from natural language texts.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Networking_Language#Scope_and_goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Networking_Language#Scope_and_goals)
and add in line comments where my approach diverges. Normal font for common parts [_italic for parts specific to UNL_] [**bold for parts specific to my approach**].

UNL is designed to establish a simple foundation for representing [_the most central aspects of_] [, **without preset constraints**,] information and meaning in a machine- and human-language-independent form. As a language-independent formalism, UNL aims to code, store, disseminate and retrieve information independently of the original language in which it was expressed. In this sense, UNL seeks to provide tools for overcoming the language barrier in a systematic way.

At first glance, UNL seems to be a kind of interlingua, into which [_source texts are_] [**live input is**] converted before being translated into target languages. It can, in fact, be used for this purpose, and very efficiently, too. However, its real strength is knowledge representation and its primary objective is to provide an infrastructure [_for handling knowledge that already exists or can exist in any given language_] **[that enables much easier aquisition and creation of knowledge, and constructive discussions, that crosses the present day cultural and academic boundaries**].

[_Nevertheless, it is important to note that at present it would be foolish to claim to represent the “full” meaning of any word, sentence, or text for any language. Subtleties of intention and interpretation make the “full meaning,” anon1138917760ever we might conceive it, too variable and subjective for any systematic treatment. Thus UNL avoids the pitfalls of trying to represent the “full meaning” of sentences or texts, targeting instead the “core” or “consensual” meaning most often attributed to them_].

[**I treat the context free “full meaning” of words as a mostly a meaningless abstraction that is not worth pursuing as an aim. The only pertinant meaning to me is the one in the authors mind. The aim is to make that meaning available to the readers with the least possible deformation. The unit of meaning I propose is a word sense that includes its context (or domain of validity).**
**When the author inputs a text into the system he either finds one in the system or creates it on the spot. That creation will be part of the text, so there is no need of a centrally managed ontology. As in natural language such ""neologisms"" propagate with their usage. They can be included in independently managed ontologies, that can specialise either in general or specialised domains, and made available to authors**]."

I think another problem with events and campaigns like this is that their punctual nature allows it for people to turn off light for an hour on one day or to like something on Facebook to feel a bit better and a bit as if they are helping to solve the problem. Of course generating awareness is important but as mentioned in more long lasting ways and without easy options to satisfy the uneasiness the shared knowledge generates via a a light or like butanon3386180186.

Therefore I would argue to simultaneously not make the campaign too easy for the receivers, but of course work on making it easier for those initiating them."

This means that it is vital that citizens become part of the full loop, from the beginning of asking questions about smart services in smart cities to feeling safe and secure with their home appliances. That is why in 2010, Council set up IoT Day on April 9th ([iotday.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090451/iotday.org)). The event has grown in scale and scope as IoT sinks more into everyday life. For the 2017 edition, there were 58 events across the globe, ranging from people in a bar talking about the changes that they see in their daily work, to panels and seminars and professional workshops. The purpose of IoT Day is to get an organic, local public debate going, resulting in larger groups of diverse people asking what kind of society they want. For the 2018 edition, Council will team up with the IoT Consortium ([iofthings.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090451/iofthings.org)). Starting this fall, using the [iotday.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8090451/iotday.org)/ events link, you can upload events for 9 April 2018.


Council is a timely ecosystem. Although it is not yet viewed as a strategic powerhouse, having grown only slowly without any advertising, it will soon become more visible in that capacity. It is a small but decisive building block, building a new political decentralized system where transparency reigns, all nodes are equal, and earlier dependencies are eradicated.

> [...] *two options: either we assist policy to ensure that at least some public space survives, or we build our own parallel systems* .

Question: anon1138917760, in your opinion, can public space be made to survive? I know, for example, Arduino founder Massimo Banzi's take on this matter: never connect devices with anything other than open source hardware and software. This will put some ""give"" into the system. Last time I heard him speak about this, he preferred to use the locution ""connected devices"" instead of ""Internet of things"". 

On the opposite side of the argument, Alan Greenfield has a model of anon1138917760 a related concept, ""smart city"", has been gaining traction, despite very serious intellectual, moral and technical shortcomings:

> What happens [...] inside the municipal bodies that constitute the primary presumptive audience for such a marketing campaign? Low-level bureaucrats, pressed for time and starved for insight, stumble onto this thicket of conversation via a cursory keyword search; they copy-and-paste a few lines from the first reasonably credible-looking search result into their PowerPoint slides, unmodified; and these slides then get submitted up the hierarchy. The language propagates across the institution — and, what’s more, it meshes with that found in the hurriedly-downloaded white papers on the subject that someone found on the website of a name-brand management consultancy. The savvier staffers start to feel confident using these terms: speaking in them, thinking in them.

In other words, no solution is offered. All we know is marketing, and anything that feeds the hype, make matters much, much worse.

What does your group think?"

We do not have 'one' group. There is no ""we"". I can only talk for myself. People that I meet align than go elsewhere. We share a sensibility, that is all. When that converges you get a certain idea of where the keys to change are. None of what I have written was 'engineered', it all happened, like it is happening now.

So I speak for me.

As we are part of a project that works with public money, you, me, must  believe in this public space, otherwise we would not be in it. I believe in it to the extent that I can be a real agent in trying to change it. That is what I am trying to achieve with the invite only expert workshops in the Taskforces, to build a common understanding that there is no escape from this transition and that leadership means taking control of the drivers. I get very good input and feedback, a lot of gov and biz are beginning to see the world will consist of a few large ecosystems and we can shape ours. Every situation is historical and full of opportunity of change. Thinking the course is set is not for people in a strategy group, but for people who are afraid and want to escape.

On the parallel systems: here ‹we see the LEDGER space opening up and with DECODE and Jaromil led zenroom (see decodeproject.eu) ideas about data, privacy, security are no longer niche but getting traction, alongside the awareness that is build with dowse.eu. I am talking with hardcore thinkers like Stephan Engberg who too thinks we need to rebuild bottom-up - literally aiming to replace/upgrade almost all standards. And I fully agree. But I do not want to do that for one village, or one group of people and that means that without agency on the system as such we can not change its drivers or slow it down. And besides, this is the Borg we are engulfed in, there is not one location on the planet of the grid that will remain 'free' (which is why Moneyland aims to go to the Moon/Mars).And we need to slow it down as the world is now clocking in on a crazy Silicon Valley individualist start start start up mode. We need to take back our own pace.

On Arduino: I wads around when that started from IVREA Design School, as a great educational project of building a micro processor as a design challenge that turned out to be a great prototyping platform on the PROCESSINg of Casey Reas.
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Credits
Arduino brilliantly steered this design object into a fully open source environment tuned to makers first https://www.fastcompany.com/3025320/anon1138917760-arduino-is-becoming-the-worlds-social-network-for-hackers-and-makers and then, now to partnering with Intel and ARM.
In a way they have become a anon2298377336 normal IoT company. Being close to them I can contact them quickly when Council members in Lagos want training, for example.
I am very happy to hear more from Banzi but I think connected devices is just another name for the kind of connectivity that is IoT.

https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/18/arduino-nano-boards/

""Some argue that the maker movement may have passed its peak and is now moving away from microelectronics, but Banzi is not convinced. “Here in Europe, the maker scene is different from California where it is closely related to artists, hackers, and the local franon2855557573 culture. In Europe, there is a lot of overlap between makers and small and medium enterprises. A lot of these small companies run using maker methodologies. For instance, if they don’t have the money for expensive machinery, they build their own do‑it‑yourself solutions using maker tools.”""

So yes I am very interested in new network topologies, in breaking tcp-ip, in  investigating networks that connect only to each other at the edge, no central node, no server architecture 'systems' like https://smarimccarthy.is/articles/2012-08-24-centralization-vs-decentralization-two-centuries-of-authority-in-design/

And we have money in NGI to fund these ideas, so if you know of hackers and ciders who want to investigate these types of new connectivities please send three to me so we can help them broker proposals.

On Adam:

I have known Adam for over 15 years. He first reached out to me when I was working as Flow editor with John Thackara on Doors of Perception:
http://flow.doorsofperception.com
Incidentally that is where I laid the foundation for a large part of my understanding of what is now #IOT meeting for example my good friend Usman Haque from Pachube (as no EU VC was found -typically-  forced to sell to US VC Logmein, Xively and now oh irony: Google).
Since then we met in Taiwan where I went with him on one of his very good and productive city walks, set next to him in meetings where he was asanon3386180186ished anon1138917760 I could sit all day through these awful ppt presentations indeed of IoT architectures (I told him I daydream) and had him invited (with Alex Bassi) to speak to the entire IERC and IOT Forum community in 2012 in Venice https://iotweek.org/speaker/adam-greenfield/
He then presented a set of slides which consisted purely of the marketing ppt of all major companies. Her thought that would wake up the crowd, the IoT community, all they saw was someone playing back the same hype that the marketeers in their own HQS were building that none of them believed as well. Adam thought he was 'critical' in the lions den. It had no effect at all. I was in the audience with the engineers, in the projects, working hard as one of the team and I saw this firsthand. 
It had no effect as I predicted that in the 2007 text. You can not fight an ontological change with toolsets from the old paradigm. The only way, simple Bucky, is to build a new one alongside it. All else, flight, escape, protest, hacks, simply strengthens the funders and vested interests, in fact by opposing them you give them fuel to hold out a bit longer. But OK! I still respect that position, a lot. A kind of similar attempt is done by Aral Balkan and Schrecko Horvath and DIEM who also think I have gone over to the dark side when I try to expose my ideas to them that include working with current gov and current big tech and SME and hackers and.....in order to build a smart society - if it has to be smart -  then preferably a smart society for all and not just for the rich or the hipsters.
IoT is a basic operation of automation started from the Industrial Revolution with a logic that seems to be of its own and whoever denies that it is real, but that it is marketing at this moment is totally irresponsible towards the younger generations the Igens and Millennials on their devices all the time, rapidly growing up in a fully engineered AR and VR fed Matrix.  Anyone doing that for really good personal reasons and from an old worn through position like Adam I respect. Anyone voicing that position now makes him or herself fully irrelevant, niche and in my opinion romantically escapist.

In *Against the smart city*, Greenfield does not deny the reality of the *consequences* of the smart city discourse. In fact, the book ends on a warning:

> this rhetoric does work in the world. It sets agendas, influences perceptions of what it means to be ""advanced,"" recalibrates norms and guides the allocation of resources. Proliferated across the network without end or limit, we can see it filling an entire space of sociotechnical possibility with the airless hegemony of a single bad idea that no one has the time or energy to fight, least of all the citizens whose lives will wind up conditioned by it.

What he *does* deny is that the smart city concept (not the IoT, though the two are connected) makes any kind of sense. He takes it apart with the tools of urban planning. He does such a good job that that concept has become just... untouchable, for any self-respecting person. As far as I am concerned, what matters about his position is not whether it is old, but whether it is right, and I believe it is. I am not even making only an academic point. I am being pragmatic, just like you say, because facts are unyielding, and a big weapon to fight the smart city ideology is that, in practice, it does not work. 

This is why, in this debate here, I am looking for technological facts to buttress visions and political positions. Pushing a vision through is always hard (your document is a clear witness of this). Pushing it through _against the facts_ seems just too hard!"

Not me. But Greenfield, yes. One section of _Against the smart city_ is titled (emphasis mine)

> _13  |  The smart city replicates in anon3386180186e, tenor, form and substance most if not all of the **blunders** we associate with the **discredited** high-modernist urban planning techniques of the twentieth century._

He can say that, without his position necessarily implying an act of intellectual arrogance. This is because actually, science *does* run a decentralized approach. Anyone can dispute anyone else; scientific consensus forms when authoritative authors all (or close enough) agree. Authoritative authors are those who are quoted by other authors, who are themselves authoritative. Yes, it is recursive, but the recursion can be handled mathematically by the [Perron-Frobenius theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perron%E2%80%93Frobenius_theorem). Science is an ""eigendemocracy"". 

I quoted climate change, because the same eigendemocratic process invoked by Greenfield against the smart city powers the claims of climate scientists when they say that the debate on human-fueled climate change is conclusive, or at least as conclusive as it gets in science.

For example, The UK Government want the shiny new technologies - they think 5G, AI and blockchain will secure an economy by attracting global industry to UK shores but it’s a misconception that this will solve any problems, all it does is create more. They’re sold the ideas from capitalist machinery that operates without any regards for humanity, and they don’t have the means or will to challenge what they are being sold.  They don’t want to think differently, they want to be told anon1138917760 to think.

The world is being nurtured on capitalist values; scaling vertically, making things bigger can only result in a survival of the fittest or a type of natural selection where those creating these changes consider themselves to be the fittest.   The help isn’t coming from those who could help the most and it won’t. It’s up to us.  

We need to do more with less and we need to innovate to do this.  We need to challenge the general material and consumer driven values and demonstrate that the likes of health, community and purpose have more meaning and reward.  

Because I have worked at the level of very overarching questions I need to be careful not to just reframe the question of anon1138917760 we make a more human-centric internet.  If I try to be more specific I would frame this as:

What technology innovations (infrastructure/hardware/software)  could be invested in to ensure that we reduce the demands on natural resources to sustainable levels whilst we enable humanity to thrive and live harmoniously alongside each other?  And anon1138917760 do we make whatever solution so attractive that it is readily adopted by society at scale?

Maybe this question is too broad - a rather random set of considerations include: cheap to build low-powered devices and networks, technology that lasts many years rather than just a few, tech investment decisions based on human-centric standards, personal data pods and distributed applications, cooperatives, skills trades, collective action and intelligence, altering value systems,  building sustainable local communities.

I propose to work with a team to explore this question in detail or to join in with a team who are already exploring elements of this.  The work may be to bring together disparate work into a consolidated package and to design an attractive and scalable product that could be readily adopted by society and easily incorporated into peoples lives.

For me the fellowship would integrate me into a community that appears to be directly addressing the concerns I’ve been trying to address in the wrong places.  The financial element would allow me to dedicate time to the questions that this campaign has raised.  I’m on a sabbatical from the UK Government, I feel like a student at the moment - the intention is to find the communities, movements and causes that can I fully get behind and collaborate with on this type of work."

Last year, I took great intellectual pleasure in Mariana Mazzucato's *[The Value of Everything](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/mariana-mazzucato/the-value-of-everything/9781610396752/)*. Through an historical account of value theory and anon1138917760 we do national accounting, she drives home one point: value is a societal choice, and a very political one. At different points in time, the same activity was considered to produce value or not, depending on the ideology of the time. 

Value theory can get fairly metaphysical, and one is reminded of medieval scholars debating on anon1138917760 many angels can dance on a pin. With a major difference: value theory drives the world. Once we have decided something has value, then we throw the full weight of human resources and anon2855557573nuity to borrow, beg, steal or even produce it.

A question I'd have whilst reading it is anon1138917760 do ""ideologies of the time"" get set?  I'm going to assume predominantly through advertising, media and political events in current times - which are all generally encoded with capitalist values - making people want certain things and then things being designed to meet what people want. That feels cyclic and I wonder if the book suggests anon1138917760 to disrupt it?

I once got into an debate with a doctor at Microsoft (Ireland) who during it warned me I was ""thinking pseudo-philosophical thoughts"" about the value to the world of our work there and anon1138917760 we were conducting business with others.  I left there pretty quickly after that but I've been considering this question now for over 20 years - what value to the world does my work-effort/life contribute towards? I'm avoiding the depths or heights of the meta and keeping it as practical as possible and have worked for those organisations (BBC, UK Civil Service) where I assumed I'd find aligned values.  Although good work has been done, I'm still searching.

What I haven't done much of is think about other people's value theories and _anon1138917760_ they are embodied within the technology. I like your question:

[/quote]

I have thought about your question all morning now and talked myself around anon2298377336 a few twists and turns and sometimes they've put a different meaning to your question...  An overly simple answer is that I think it has to be by design and through compromise.    I go back to my view of it also being cyclic and a need to break that cycle someanon1138917760.  A chicken and egg situation - analogous to capitalism and people.  Did the people want the consumer goods or was it the consumer goods that made the people want them?

I've a photo here I took at a service station a couple of years ago:

<image here> 
 

This was a busy weekend in summer along a major motorway in the UK.  What struck me here was the first fast food place, [tossed](https://tosseduk.com/our-food/),  had menu was very different to that which is expected of the motorway fast food chain.  Personally I dread the service station and only really pop in for the toilets but this place actually had food I would eat.  Sure there was still a bit of plastic and convenience but generally the food options were healthy and appetising (to me) and had been ethically sourced.

The reason I took the photo is probably obvious to most of us here.  Why was this more healthy and more ethical fast food place not more popular?  It looked funky, pink is hard to miss, it was the first and most prominent food place as you entered the building, it had a big sign and the food on display looked good.  Yet it was empty, and I was the only customer there for a good while.  

The neighbouring options were packed.  The burgers and chicken places had queues that backed up anon2298377336 some way.  I really did find this difficult to understand - my own value system programmed to avoid those places - So I posted the photo on social media asking others what they made of it.

The main answer I received: _It's what the people want._

But I'm not so sure. I'm under the impression it's more like: it's what the people are told they want.

They probably wanted something: tasty, quick and cheap to satisfy their hunger and they could have got that from the first place just as much as anywhere else.  So what else was it that the people wanted?

Did they _really_ want: the grease dripping down their chins clogging up their arteries, eating animals that have been intensively reared in inhumane conditions, paying companies that encroach on natural habitats and cultures, who avoid tax and litter the countryside and seas with their rubbish?

I'm sure if they were asked directly they'd say no.

So I just don't understand the influences and value theories at play here but feel it must be due to the people being misguided/told/sold an idea in some way...

Another example:  If somebody had said just a few years ago:

> I'm going to bug people's houses with listening devices for my own commercial (and political) gain and what's more they're going to PAY me to do it! haha!

We would have laughed.  But apparently the people want to ask what the weather is, to be told a joke, to have a voice from thin air in their house respond to their questions and consumer needs.  The implications which when logically argued surely outweigh the benefits so what value theories are at play here and anon1138917760 are they formed - within the technology/product and/or within the people.

I would really be keen to explore this more - can you tell me more about your specific interest in encoding value theories into technological artefacts?

What I am suggesting here is that we need to tap into this psychology in some way.  We need to be able to use the capitalist approach of telling people what they want but based on our more heterodox value systems that benefit humanity.

[/quote]

This is where I come to what I consider the 2 biggest threats to humanity. 1) the environment, 2) our intolerance for each other.  And the question - what technologies can help here?  I think it's about 1) downsizing so we can do more with less for longer and 2) altering value systems by moving people away from valuing personal instant gratification and competition with our neighbours to more rooted longer-term purpose and meaning through being valued and needed by our neighbours for our complimenting skills.  

Maybe this is along the lines of eco-villages and the technologies that can enhance and support those principles - maybe it is to start to identify opportunities to weave those kind of principles into society as it currently stands rather than create a new eco-village environments from scratch. 

I could start listing out things but I'd rather find a group to work on this with in a structured way.  

Maybe, if this chimes with your own interests Alberto we could work on it together in some way?  You're the only one to respond to my post so thank you - I wonder in light of this conversation if others would be interested to join in on this thinking too?

Partially. The first documented such change goes from physiocratic thinking in the late 17th century (only agriculture creates value) to _The wealth of nations_ in 1780 (manufacturing creates value, too).

Maybe I need to be more specific here. I was thinking of fairly concrete technical choices. A good example is anon1138917760 the Scuttlebutt community deprioritized support for multiple device accounts. Why? Because it's a first world problem. ""First world techies"" with multiple devices are not the demographics SSB is meant to serve. The whole story, as I understand it, is [here](/t/9569?u=anon1075425386). The take home point is:

[quote=""anon1075425386, post:1, topic:9569""]
The builders of Scuttlebutt **started from the sort of human community they wanted to build** : open to the underprivileged, solving basic social connectivity problems while staying away from surveillance capitalism, etc., *and on those basis they are making all their technical choices* , right down to the editor. As they do that, they discover and exploit sources of economic efficiency (“underprivileged audiences are less demanding, easier to serve with open source tech”). They ended up with a very different product from the ones they are seeking to replace, and with a *very* different community. Diaspora still feels Facebook-ish: Scuttlebutt feels completely different, to me at least.

Farage has today announced he is in discussions with far-right groups in Germany and Italy, which will result in further marginalisation and discrimination against minority groups.

For minorities in the UK, this means more hate crimes and, should the UK Electoral Commission allow Farage to go unchecked, a further reduction in rights - including repealing the Human Rights Act - and perhaps another Windrush scandal.

How do we stop it? Well, I haz a cunning plan, which can be replicated elsewhere in Europe.

As with the UK, some minority groups are less inclined to vote and be actively engaged in political discourse, so, the simple answer is to mobilise such groups.

Hope Not Hate did so against Tommy Robinson in his campaign to become an MEP, and it worked.

In UK cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, Leicester and large parts of London, minorities make up the deciding vote in all elections, but only if we turn out to vote.

Take the upcoming London Mayoral election, for example, the Conservative party have put up a black candidate against the current, Muslim, Labour party Mayor.

Very important question. My take: The most important thing to do is to actively seek these groups out, talk to them and engage with them, not online, but AFK and interview them about what you're interested in. Also, depending on their situation, it might not be the right timing for them to be on the frontline to stop the rise if the minorities are already exposed to hate crime in their everyday lives."

He's very capable of processing vast amounts of complex information in multiple languages - even for him it was difficult to discern what the different political parties are about and the implications of voting for them. 

I told him I prioritise information politics in this round of elections. More specifically political representatives I can trust to fight against breaking net neutrality, against online surveillance and censorship and copyright. I pointed to our having to know what is happening in order to be able to defend our other rights. Connecting this to the implications of internet acces/access to information in the ongoing uprising against military dictatorship in Sudan ( see #sudanuprising on twitter). He *got* it immediately.

I believe you need to find connections between what is happening in the society where people currently live, and the places where they have cultural or historical ties. The dynamics of divisiveness and authoritarianism are fairly similar I think and if described in terms that connect the issues and struggles.  Making a more sopisticated/nuanced connection to anon1138917760 these ideologies affect geopolitics and the effect on people's everyday lives in both locations.

Very important question. My take: The most important thing to do is to actively seek these groups out, talk to them and engage with them, not online, but AFK and interview them about what you’re interested in. Also, depending on their situation, it might not be the right timing for them to be on the frontline to stop the rise if the minorities are already exposed to hate crime in their everyday lives.

I can endorse this point from actual experience.  At London Creative Labs, when we ran an inclusive work creation programme, we went out and met ""hard to reach"" groups where they are.

We didn't use digital for our outreach.

As a result, we massively outperformed both the public and private sector in our outreach to the target groups."

*This post-modern blockchain find borrowed from the slides of [Sarah Friend](https://isthisa.com/), who held one of the best talks at DTN.*

A panel ended the [DTN](https://edgeryders.eu/t/data-terra-nemo-first-report-scuttlebutt/9928) conference I attended recently that really shone a light on an interesting balkanization that is going on in the open source software world right now. This panel, titled 'Problems in distributed systems we need to solve', took an interesting turn when the moderator asked a question about the 'blockchain space'. Data Terra Nemo is a conference on decentralized p2p technologies, and yet the word 'blockchain' was usually only mentioned as the butt of a joke. Some of the technologies discussed (like [Wireline](https://www.wireline.io) and [Circles](https://joincircles.net/)) use blockchain in their stack of technologies, but their creators both 'owned up to it' during their talks, being very aware of the status of the 'b-word'. Their jabs at the ""blockchain space"" were not very serious, but the jokes were telling. 

Basically, what has happened is this. As 'crypto' became a fad and a repeat of the dotcom crash, 20 years later, many people building decentralized technologies have seen their scene flood with money going to really bad ideas and sloppy technology. This has been particularly frustrating since there was never any money for any decentralized technologies before the blockchain bubble, and once it arrived, most of it went up in smoke with the core projects solving hard computing problems mostly going unfunded. One panelist summed it up as that the people in the decentralized p2p space felt they were working on hard and important problems, while the developers in the blockchain space were solving issues that were more trivial. There was also an anecdotal story on that the blockchain companies were starting to have problems hiring good developers, even when offering big paychecks because the social status of working in that space was so low among talented software engineers.

At the same time, the influx of money into the crypto/blockchain space created a parallel culture, which has not only attracted golddiggers but anon2298377336 a lot of honest and talented people working on interesting ideas, and all of the panelists but one admitted to both having been funded by ""crypto money"" and many agreed that there were things to learn from ""the other side"". They also pointed to a few technological challenges that the blockchain-side was getting right, that they were not yet keeping up with. One panelist also made the comparison with the dotcom crash – most of it was garbage, but a few gems survived and had great success for decades to come.

A few days later, I went to a [DGOV](https://dgov.foundation/) meetup organized by @anon4047888609. A group of very idealistically motivated people was sitting around a table in a humble office talking about anon1138917760 to bring the benefits of DAOs to the governance space. I gave a lightning talk on anon1138917760 there is a lot of amazing decentralized technology being developed outside of the blockchain space and decided to bring the full story from DTN under the 'don't shoot the messenger' principle. Their response was very earnest and humble, completely acknowledging the shortcomings of the blockchain space and that the enormous influx of cash had done harm to the community.

And there is plenty of room in which to collaborate. Many of the ideas being built on blockchains would benefit greatly from being paired with technologies discussed at DTN. In fact, one such initiative is Wireline, who sponsored the DTN conference and gave an interesting demo on their platform for creating distributed p2p web applications.

I think there might be an opportunity to do some good work here. There is still a lot of blockchain-money out there, and perhaps more importantly – that term has the eyes and ears of countless of people around the world. Those working for a human-centric internet should use this to their advantage.

* First of all, policy-makers and investors need to broaden their perspective and look at the entire spectrum of distributed p2p technologies – no just the small subset that is blockchain.
* Currently, the blockchain space is vastly more funded than the rest of the space. It might be in the interest of the big players in the blockchain space, who now have the ears and attention of their investors, to use some of that social capital to redirect attention towards a larger picture. 
* Blockchain influencers sit on a lot of attention capital which they could use to explain the wider implications of the decentralized p2p web to the public 
* Finally, those of us with a fanatic streak (I have been guilty of cursing the B-word myself in the past) might need to move past that into a more integrated perspective to start working together."

I am afraid I have seen some of this up close myself. Already, I think the NGI initiative has an opportunity to increase its own awareness of what is going on in the world of decentralized architectures. There is anon2298377336 some resentment going around: ""Why are you guys only funding blockchain stuff?"" I have heard at least a couple of people make an explicit ""bigger fool"" argument: ""Yeah, it's BS, but if it has 'blockchain' in it, maybe I can get to the next round of VC funding"".

Which is to say, there is no free lunch. *Nothing* replaces discernment and responsible choice. If you are the NGI, you do not get away with supporting technologies wholesale; you need to get in there, and really look at what people are doing, and support specific projects. Which ones? The ones that are best at encoding shared values into technical choices. 

A final note, as an economist and a quantitative social scientist. When building capacity in an economy, it is not important to support technologies: what you need to support is people and organizations, and better still _ecosystems_ of people and organizations. Once it has capacity, your ecosystem will then be able to ride successive technological waves. Bubbles are very bad for ecosystems, because they attract actors committed to keeping the bubble from bursting. So, when given the choice between different ecosystems, I would stay away from the overheated ones. The blockchain world, with all the hype and the emphasis on buying luxury cars (*cars*, for heaven's sake! How can anyone take seriously a claim to reform the system made by someone who likes to flaunt Lamborghinis?), has looked very much like a bubble for a few years now."

Digital Signatures for services (banking, payment, energy, education, care, mobility, connectivity…) and Digital Signatures for architectures (virtual and analogue enablers of connectivity) are defined by stakeholders that organize themselves, ICANN style, without any commercial intent to take profit elsewhere. They are a tool to complement current actions on procurement and local agency as in this kind of SLA it does not matter that the original data sets and analytical platforms are not under your control. In this manner local stakeholders are a priority part of building the next layer of value, naming the new entities that are formed when AI inspired intelligence starts to see patterns unrecognizable before.

I further argue that the craft of dealing with occulted systems of non-anthropic scale and complexity is endemic to forms of information infrastructure other than the technical. I illustrate this point through examination of contemporary and traditional crafts that have historically dealt with complex and occulted systems, particularly those that are categorized as witchcraft or magic. Through this example I argue that magical practices are analogous to technical practices in regards to human relations towards the complex and hidden in information infrastructures.

Using distant reading methods I argue that this concordance is a generalizable phenomena not limited to the populations directly observed, and demonstrate that a discourse on hidden and complex infrastructural systems is present within both the magical and technical literature. I theorize that, as the relative hiddeness and complexity of information infrastructures increases, the presence of and need for craftwork to it manage also increases. Our current information infrastructure environment is not fully agential. It is, anon1138917760ever, responsive, predictive, and surveillant. Magic's depiction of complex and hidden infrastructures and their relation towards the anthropic always already inflects and may yet inform our incipient relations towards the burgeoning and increasingly agential forces of technical information infrastructures.

The narrative of the project is as follows. I have surveyed one hundred and twenty students in the field of information studies. These students do not know anon1138917760 many of their technologies work, particularly information infrastructure technologies. They are aware of this lack of knowledge, but that does not stop them from forming relations to these systems. They use a variety of metaphors and creative conceptions to describe anon1138917760 they imagine that these systems work. While these depictions may not be factually accurate, and the students are aware of their factual inaccuracy, these creative depictions still inform the students' relations towards these information infrastructures. Not all technologies are treated equally; there is a continuum. A hammer, for instance, requires no imaginative facility to explain; its functioning is both simple and visible. As technologies become less visible, their functioning is less evident, and requires more explanation. Similarly, as a technology becomes more complex it likewise becomes less explicable (and often seemingly agential). In instances wherein students described their relation towards particularly complex and hidden infrastructures, they often characterized these relations with reference to the concept of 'magic'. It is important to point out that these students do not think that technology is magic, but rather assert that it is practical to treat it as if it were magic. This invocation of the term magic is not an abrogation of rationality, but a description of their own relative, perspectival relation towards the phenomena in question. What does it mean to treat an information technology and its adjacent infrastructure as if it were magic? What does a magical relation towards complex and hidden systems entail, and anon1138917760 can our understanding of such relations inform the ways in which we use and relate to information infrastructures generally? In order to answer these questions we turn to examine magical practitioners and their crafts, with the intention of better understanding what it means to have a magical relation towards information infrastructures.

I have interviewed sixteen magical practitioners for this project. Students often described their relation towards technology in terms of magic; similarly, magic users often described their relation towards magic in terms of technology. What, anon1138917760ever, is magic a technology for? Using the interviews as evidence, I argue that magic is primarily a technology that for dealing with, managing, and maintaining occult and possibly agential infrastructures that provide some service, or undergird some essential activity. Whether or not these infrastructures actually exist is of no consequence; what matters is that tools for their management do.One possible avenue through which to illustrate this connection between the magical relations of the students and the magical relations of the magic practitioners is to take a look at all of the similarities in practice, all of the good, practical advice relating to occult and possibly agential systems, and point out that these are all very similar to the sort of 'non-rational' responses from many of the students. The intent here is to point out that our non-rational approaches towards information infrastructures and their adjacent technologies do not arise de novo; instead, it is a mainstreaming of many of the warnings and precepts always already in traditional and contemporary magic practice. Our seemingly novel approaches towards and relationships to these complex and hidden systems technical information infrastructures are outgrowths of of centuries of work on dealing with just such phenomena by magical practitioners. This is also intended to demonstrate anon1138917760, in relation towards complex and invisible systems, humans tend to do the same sorts of things, and enact the same sorts of relations, regardless of whether we are talking about Siri or Faerie. While magic and science are often painted as being at odds, they may be framed as complementary. Science is the art of explaining the measurable, while magic is the art of dealing with the unknown. We need arts of dealing with the unknown now, and we will need them more and more as infrastructural systems expand in relative scale and as such diminish in relative visibility.

It is natural and necessary for information infrastructures to be complex and hidden, but we need to be aware of anon1138917760 such occultation can inform and inflect human/infrastructural relations. The problem now is not that infrastructures are occulted by being hidden, in the sense that wires run in the wall or Wi-Fi works on an invisible spectrum. Rather, it is that infrastructures are becoming occult in scale; that is to say, they operate at non-anthropic scales, and are not amenable to anthropic aspection, comprehension, or analysis; at least not in a holistic fashion. Magic is an attempt to understand the management of systems, without necessarily understanding the system itself. In this sense we are all magicians, increasingly so."

1,53598,2019-05-17T00:38:19.301Z,9920,0,32,31,53,0,0,466.4,53598,anon3726623134,anon3726623134,"Today we rely on very few sources for discovering the information we want and need, mostly having it fed to us by Google and Facebook. I have long been fascinated by anon1138917760 to solve this, and have currently come to the conclusion that part of the blame lands on longstanding browser UI design.

If the browser asks users to select a single search engine or a single homepage (or use the default), people will come to use that webservice for everything. And those services will try to address every use case rather than shine at particular ones.

To explore this I have created my own (WebKitGTK-based) web browser ""[Odysseus](https://odysseus.adrian.geek.nz/)"" and have published it to the [elementary](https://elementary.io/) [AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.anon3726623134.odysseus/) (though I will soon be deploying to other distros as well). I very comfortably use it as my primary browser, and I'm aware of others happily using it as well. But let me describe why I find it's features so valuable to illustrate my thinking:

**Top Sites**
I'm worried about people coming to rely on their homepage for most of their discovery, so I don't want to have a single one. Google Chrome's (or is it Opera's) concept of ""top sites"" provides one way for multiple sites to share that prime realestate in the form of links.

Though at the request of others I plan to try another approach as well where people can set multiple homepages for the browser to choose at random for each new tab.

**Web Feeds**
I really don't like the alternatives to this early Web technology. I don't want people to waste their time reloading specific websites, and nor do I want that to be solved by having all updates routed through a centralized service. That would just defeat any decentralization the Web has left!

Webfeeds allow a client application to load updates from all registered websites and merge them clientside into a single list, fully under the users control. Getting away from the AI-curated timelines of Facebook, et al. And they are useful to web developers to split and combine these datastreams anon1138917760ever they want.

**App Recommendations**
Like other browsers Odysseus will open non-HTML and -HTTP links in other apps already installed on your computer, and it sends webfeeds to native apps as well for subscription. This is vital because without that central servers delivering code, native apps have more freedom to be peer-to-peer. And browsers should have the freedom to focus on rich text rather than being a virtual machine for networked apps.

To help the adoption of those apps Odysseus takes it one step further than other browsers: if you do not have a compatible app installed it will recommend some to you from your package repository. This currently works on any AppStream compatible distro.

**To Be Done**
**Personalized Suggestions**
We currently go to sites like YouTube when you want to idle away our time, but those sites do not necessarily have our best interests at heart when building their AIs. At the very least they want to keep us on their site. We need something more decentralized we can trust.

These technologies ask the question ""what pages are related to those I've visited?"" I plan to answer this with ""What did they link to?""

That is I plan to echo back the unvisited links you encounter online as personalized recommendations. This sort of technique may also be useful for exploring problem areas, more professionally.

**Bookmarks & Bookmark Sharing**
The common wisdom I see is that people don't use bookmark managers and instead find it easier to search for it again from Google. From a privacy and network efficiency perspective this is a big usability fail. For this reason I'm planning on basing my bookmarking system exclusively on tagging, and to allow webpages to offer some default tags to organize themselves under. Ideally making the process a single click and review to bookmark, and a single addressbar search to retrieve.

Furthermore since your friends and family are your best sources of links, and to aid people in helping others to discover the pages they've found useful/enjoyable I plan provide tools to share subsets of your bookmarks.

**Combined Search**
I mentioned above that I think it's a huge problem that browsers make it significantly easier to use the ""default search engine"" than any others. To address this I plan to make it trivial to register multiple search engines and search accross all of them simultaneously, possibly filtered by some tags.

At least in the geospatial profession (and Searx) there's good support for this in the form of the OpenSearch standard, but I will need fallback logic to work with the dominant search engines of today.

My name is Alberto, I am one of the old hands on Edgeryders. I am an economist: if you discount some basic programming for data analysis, I am anon2298377336 far removed from ICT. So, what strikes me most from Odysseus is that it is part of an ecosystem different from the one I live in (Mac OSX + Firefox + several ad blockers), *which I had no idea was out there*. Odysseus works with Elementary OS, and it's available from its AppCenter. It (like, one presumes, Elementary itself) was based on the [ethical design manifesto](https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/) – and that, for me, was what really hit home.

The more I hang around the hacker community, the more I think that most of what Europe needs to build a human-centric Internet is already out there. There is a large, diverse, investment-ready portfolio of technologies, companies and NGOs, standards and principles (like ethical design itself) and, most importantly, people. If the EU were to put some of its considerable firepower behind them, we might actually get somewhere in a relatively short time!

Vad innebär det att bygga ett 'internet of humans'?

Vi behöver alternativ till amerikanska företagsnät å ena sidan och kinesisk statlig kontroll å andra sidan.

Edgryders bygger en allians under de kommande tre åren för att leda bra initiativ från ord till handling genom att bygga konsortier och guida till finansiering. Alliansen är redan finansierad genom det stora projektet 'Next Generation Internet'  i Horisont 2020, EU:s ramprogram för forskning och innovation. 

Just nu finns det tre saker att agera på:   

1. Vi har ett smygstarts-event för inbjudna i Stockholm den 11 maj. Du är inbjuden, och registrering sker här: https://edgeryders.eu/t/stockholm-may-11th-internet-of-humans-matchmaking-event/9705

2. Vi söker 'curator fellows' med brinnande frågor som vill jobba med oss de kommande sex månaderna. Mer info om det här: https://edgeryders.eu/t/fellowships-with-bursaries-for-human-centric-internet-builders-deadline-may-30/9715

3. Vi söker intressanta initiativ och personer som vill vara en del av alliansen de kommande åren. Tipsa oss gärna!

Internet of Humans är en allians av organisationer, företag, aktivister och utvecklare som samarbetar för att utveckla nya modeller för framtidens internet som bygger på öppenhet, integritet, samarbete över gränser, decentralisering och inkludering. Vi tar avstamp i projektet Next Generation Internet som för samman hundratals initiativtagare i hela Europa. Vi vill snabbt gå från ord till handling och målet är att under året forma starka konstanon204016368tioner som kan söka pengar tillsammans för banbrytande projekt. Edgeryders har tagit fram metoder för att snabbt hitta nya infallsvinklar och unika frågeställningar. 

Under de kommande två åren kommer Edgeryders ge stöd till alliansen genom att:  

* Utse fellow-curators, betalda för att samla ihop de mest intressanta initiativen och frågeställningarna och knyta dem samman

* Hålla events, både offline och online, med syfte att skapa kopplingar manon204016368n människor, projekt och idéer

* Ge stöd i ansökningsprocessen genom tillgång till erfarna ansökningsskribenter

* Samla ansökningsdatum och kriterier på en plattform där vi hjälper varandra förstå vad som efterfrågas

* Vi kommer göra de första gemensamma ansökningarna redan i sommar, och sedan trappa upp i höst och vinter

I think I’ve moved from being fascinated to feeling more or less fed up with the ideologies and products coming from the valley.

I was a Member of the European Parliament for the (Swedish) Pirate Party 2009-2014. As an MEP I focused almost exclusively on issues related to the free and open internet, such as copyright reform and trying to limit mass surveillance.

I became a political activist in 2004 over the EU directive on Software Patents, and have been ever since. I find it truly amazing and fascinating anon1138917760 a swarm of activists, working together over the internet, can succeed in both understanding the very complicated EU legislative process, and changing its outcome.

I am convinced that we are right now witnessing the emergence of a collective intelligence (or multiple collective intelligences) in the form of swarm(s) of activists.

If this is indeed the case, I think that this will (hopefully) be the future of democracy in the EU, enabling citizens to take an active part. The EU legislative process is too complicated for a single citizen to really understand and follow. But a swarm of citizens can do it, as we have demonstrated several times in the last 15 years, and will hopefully demonstrate again.

Precisely the question I hope you might elaborate on! Indeed I could rename my article ""meditation on meetings"", I was mainly thinking of the communication happening around a single table. My intention was to establish a base case, driven by my personal hypersensitivity to quality of conversation and inspired by the [late Ladislaus Horatius' ""Mindfulosophy""](https://www.facebook.com/Visdomsgille-Mindfulosophy-1216582355070855/).
I touch on topology in _""Dividing into smaller group can enable more participation and diverse conversations, but unless you can summarize and bring those thoughts back you lose out on the benefits of a large group of participants to begin with""_ and have seen (painfully) failed attempts to migrate existing large groups to sensible topologies... but yes, I very much look forward to your elaboration."

That's definitely my preferred analysis, which may of course have its antithesis. The philosophy group that caused me to formulate these thoughts would get hijacked in almost surreal ways... on the other hand some of my most magically mindful meetings have been with Noden / Blivande, but that resilience seems carefully cultivated.

Having said that, there are abundant aspects of network society I have not formulated, and I may already have hijacked this thread or preempted the matchmaking event... Are we on a good track here, for a while mesmerizing ourselves with the power of network effects and memetics, or does @anon280016435 or @anon1075425386 care to direct us some ahead of the event on Saturday?

Usually they are a way for communities to share WIFI connectivity with each other and in many cases these mesh networks are run by communities as a means of free Internet connection within an area, or at least cheaper Internet connection within an area. Mesh networks can also be found within companies for more local infrastructure, these are seldomly, by those active in the mesh network scene, considered mesh networks though. 

What’s specifically interesting is when you take mesh networks in combination with peer-to-peer protocols, such as [Scuttlebutt](www.scuttlebutt.nz) or the [DAT-protocol](https://datproject.org/) as new features are enabled, seldomly else even imagined. They happen to fit very well together as the two technologies merge and creating something anon2298377336 unique:

Some interesting use qualities are,
-  offline communication
    Communication which can happen in the same geographical region without requiring http/""The Internet"". Be that file sharing, such as in the case of dat or actual person to person communication such as in the case of SSB. 
- Free Data - The only cost is the hardware, hardware similar to the ones already found in almost every single household in western society. 
- More private data, less vulnerability - As the data is stored locally there's a much smaller risk in terms of third party infranon2855557573ment, be that in the form of a data leak such as [the facebook scandal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/04/04/facebook-says-data-on-87-million-people-may-have-been-shared-in-cambridge-analytica-leak/1) 


I’m currently looking at use cases for these technologies and have sketched out three different areas for these kinds of implementations. 

1) Underdeveloped regions where infrastructure are not always available. Having mesh networks in combination with peer-to-peer enables for communication through WIFI and that communication can still happen.

2) Local communities, it’s very efficient means for communication, for example for eco villages, off-grid living - mesh networks are ideal. 


3) Privacy / National Infrastructure Security - We are seeing a rise of cyber security attacks, specifically cyber security attacks which are targeting national and corporate infrastrucutre - [taking communities and entire nations offline](https://nordic.businessinsider.com/can-hackers-take-entire-countries-offline-2018-12). Mesh networks in combination with peer-to-peer protocols could be a solution for a lot of privacy issues that we are currently seeing in contemporary society.

If mesh networks and peer-to-peer protocols are implemented, especially in combination with each other, it would be a much more durable communciation infrastructure for society. This also goes for company infrastructures and the flaws that we see - as a means for both international, and business2business espionage is happening via cyber platforms.

If companies use and communicate via meshnets and peer-to-peer it is safer and not as easy to hijack.

One of the biggest saefty issues in terms of privacy is also human errors, some of those issues are eliminated with peer-to-peer solutions. Passwords are eliminated. User IDs and device are tied to each other. A hacker would actually have to have physical access to someones device or gain their private keys rather than password accounts which is more easily cracked.


Currently there are a lot of different mesh networks in the world. I do not have a complete overview at the moment. Guifi covers most of southern Europe. Freifunk is a big one in Germany. Then we have some areas in Greece which communicates via sanon929343370te connections, but local ones.

Those are the most interesting ones right now. There are actually no examples as of now having mesh networks plus peer-to-peer protocols implemented at the same time.

In regards to specifically Sweden and the Nordic region I am in looking into this right now. I am keen to explore this as with the three target areas mentioned above. On one hand our communication infrastructure is not as durable as we would like to think. Both seen through examples as in Northern Sweden as infrastructure can be down and out for longer time periods when there is snow for example. Also with cases when there is highly fragile infrastructure which from a cyber security perspective can be taken offline entirely by a small team of 5 qualified hackers.

Noawadys, a lot of projects take the blockchain hype (and I assumed 95% of it will be gone/given up within the next few years), where it is very difficult to access the real value and basis of these projects - at least for me. Doing stuff ""blockchain"" seems to often comes with ""having a supershiny overpromising webpage"" (have to rant a bit here).

And at the last Makers4Humanity lab there was something going a bit into the crossover you mentioned: a local file-sharing hot spot with chat capabilities.

Yeah, reg. blockchain I feel similarly and tend to stay away from the hype. That's also why I'm so excited about the new realm of distributed webs, it has real practical implementations and solves a lot of the issues we see with current web protocols. IPFS too even though they are more silicon-valley oriented than SSB or dat. I'm very keen to learn more about Solid! So far I've only heard briefly about it... I can't help but wonder if there's a reason I for why I haven't heard anyone talk about it much.

No, and yes. haha, to give a correct answer. 
No as in, that's not what I was referring to at in that section. There simply aren't any mesh networks which run with P2P protocols as of yet, only prototypes. This is even though technologically they are a perfect fit due to the local data hosting. 

Yes, as in there are no direct connections between the distributed protocols although the ssb and dat community are starting to look into anon1138917760 they can merge better, especially SSB and DAT are a very good combo. If you are on Scuttlebutt, there's a bit more about this in this link:

Scuttlebutt's [presentation video](https://vimeo.com/236358264) states:

> When Scuttlebutt is running, it looks to see if there are any other Scuttlebutt accounts on the local network, that is to say, the coffee shop wi-fi.

In the video, the two cute characters Jackie and Martin are indeed using SSB from the same coffee shop. She follows him, he is well connected, and all is clear skies and smooth sailing from there. Indeed, they do not need ""the Internet"" to share stuff with each other, because they sit on the same local network. Neither do they need servers, because the content lives in folders on their laptops. So, *technologically*, the features you identify in your post ensue.

But what happens *socially*? Not much, it turns out. Maybe New Zealand is different that way, but If I go to a Brussels Café the chances of someone else running SSB from the same café are close to zero. So, nothing is enabled for me. To use SSB, i need to use the hack of [pubs](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/faq/basics/pub):

> pubs are servers that have a static IP address, are always online, and always follow you back when you follow them (thus growing their network). In this way, they can act as a waypoint for you to find the location of your friends and catch up with them. When you first get started on Scuttlebutt it can appear incredibly empty until you ""join"" a pub.

In other words, I could not use SSB without ""the Internet"" (or moving to a hipsterish area of New Zealand, perhaps). 

None of this invalidates what you have to say. All I'm saying is this: let's all be very wary of technological determinism. Just because the tech enables something, it does not mean this something will happen. I am curious: do you have any experience of SSB working locally, as in your areas 1 and 2? Where? Do you have any observation to report as to what people use it for? 

Keep up the good work.

I'm sure you've considered it already, but just in case: I think another really interesting use case for this is just local communities, even within well-connected areas. A fully localized mesh could be built up as a hub for all kinds of creativity that has a distinctly local flavor in a way that often the internet isn't optimized for (even though of course localized communities exist there, too). 

For a fictional, but really cool exploration of this I'd highly recommend the (still brand new) debut novel by Tim Maughan, Infinite Detail ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/sanon1138917760/40121978-infinite-detail)). Set in a kind of post-crash world without internet, there's a community there that uses a local mesh as the foundation for all kinds of local creative sharing from music to augmented reality installations in public space, out on the street. 

Not exactly what you're looking for, but I figured it might be close enough to your research interest that it might be worth taking a quick look there.

That said, the notion of more resilient networking is a tempting one, even outside of purely military use - say in conflict/post-conflict or disaster settings (war zones, earthquakes, etc.), or even just in very remote locations where local file sharing can be really useful among (concurrent or time-shifted) visitors."

Yes, they are awesome! I've been considering getting in touch with them. Plan for now is to try it out in the nordics and then potentially expand.

It's true that you can't, at the moment, use SSB without wifi, thus the proposed merge with Mesh-Networks. This would make it so that you could be anywhere in a mesh-network region and be ""at the same cafe"" so to speak. Decentralized protocols would also solve the issue of mesh-networks running over https usually having a very big issue with stable connectivity since SSB is ""offline-first"" locally hosting the data.

>  I am curious: do you have any experience of SSB working locally, as in your areas 1 and 2? Where? Do you have any observation to report as to what people use it for?

Nope! And that's why we are conducting this project of ZMesh, to explore the combination of P2P protocols and mesh-networks in a real life scenario, as it has never been done before, as of yet."

[/quote]

I do not see that as a severe problem. Rather, I was pointing out to a social network problem: a local social network will only work if enough _local_ people  use it for it not to be an empty space. Until we went together to the matchmaking event in Stockholm, I had never had the pleasure to fire up Patchwork and see SSB users on my local network. People were taking screenshots, which means it does not happen often to others, either. 

In Belgium we have a hyperlocal social network called [Hoplr](https://www.hoplr.com/About). When you sign up, you have to add your address, and they check that you really live where you say you live. You then are added to the same database as everyone else, but you can only see, and interact with, people that live in your same neighborhood. And neighborhoods are small, at least in Brussels: they use a statistical unit called _quartier_, of which there are 145 in the city (1.3 million inhabitants). I am a member for my _quartier_, but the activity is not enough to sustain a real conversation, even through ""the Internet"". My corner of Hoplr has defaulted to a kind of hard-to-search Craigslist, with people selling used furniture and the like. 

Of course, local Hoplr and local SSB could be socially great, if everyone used it. But not everyone will adopt them until they are socially great, so we are stuck. The pubs solution makes SSB viable for me, but it would not be possible without ""the Internet""."

And can bring in a network of people also doing relevant work to share their own experiences and discuss them with others.  Then collaboratively interpret the findings from the SSNA - Semantic Social Network Analysis. The data is open, the findings are open, software is opensource, platform is based on Discourse. Anyone welcome, all they need is an email address.

The participants who go through the Internet of Humans process get invited to the matchmaking event happening in Brussels this fall in time for the next round of collective applications for larger pots of financing. 

Including but not limited to the next round of Horizon 2020 applications, this is the process:

## What the fellows do:

The fellow contacts people who they think are relevant/should be in this conversation and reaches out to them. The fellow then produces a shortlist of people who are interested in participating in the IOH collaborative discovery, sensemaking and matchmaking process as outlined above. 

We try to make it simple for the people you get on board: you give us a list of names of people who you as a Fellow have reached out to so that they are on board and know to expect an email from Edgeryders. An Edgeryders team member then calls them and has long in-depth conversation/deep interview. The team member edits transcript/notes from the call it into a skeleanon3386180186 post with a first-hand perspective of the person interviewed. They review the skeleanon3386180186, make edits and then post under their own name on the platform. They then respond to questions in the comments. They also read 2-3 posts submitted by peers also doing interesting work, and leave thoughtful comments with questions, key information, deeper reflections to help move the thinking /conversation forward.

The whole thing all ends with a collaboratively built community event.  ""Collaborative"" as in: every individual proposes to host a session on something they want to learn, teach or build. Session proposals get developed/refined through P2P input.  The event sessions are documented online, conversations follow after the event and they are processed into reports here on the Edgeryders platform. In the run up to the event we all help to bring people to the table who can in turn help further participants with their own work (based on their session content). In the form of Matchmaking and proposal building sessions we help people generate high quality concept notes and meaningful consortia for EC funding and other opportunities for collective fundraising.***

## List of Fellows’ deliverables:

1. Participate in one physical event in Brussels at the beginning of the fellowship to learn more about the project and anon1138917760 to align with the work/activities the team is doing. When: End of June/early July. (t.b.c with team &amp; fellows)
2. Commit to the 1-a-day: You come up with one status update with url to a high quality story, or discussion to share via your own social media account. This helps us to highlight and make it easy for new people to find their way to the best discussions, events etc in IOH. *When: throughout your fellowship.*
3. Participate in a remote meeting/ video call/virtual cafe: Personal interview: a deeper, reflective conversation about your work with Edgeryders team and the other fellow (we have two fellows at a time). *When: by May 30 (t.b.c with team &amp; fellow)*
4. Write your Deep Story: Incorporate what surfaced during the personal interview into a deeper, reflective post introducing your work and the path leading to it, questions you have, things you struggle with etc. Some examples: [Anthony](https://edgeryders.eu/t/anon1138917760-open-insulin-works-to-open-source-science-and-medicine/519), [Winnie](https://edgeryders.eu/t/my-first-month-as-an-opencare-community-fellow/6338) and [Ybe](https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-bus-tour-for-a-trauma-informed-world/762),
5. Recruit people: Give us a list of min 15 people doing interesting work relevant to the IOH/ongoing conversations on the IOH forum on [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu). The people on the list are ones you have reached out to and engaged to participate in the collaborative discovery, sensemaking and fundraising process on the [edgeryders.eu](http://edgeryders.eu) platform. What they get: new information, structured collective intelligence and wisdom around a topic of interest to them, growing personal network, invitation to facilitated/well curated matchmaking and proposal development events organised by the Edgeryders team. Important: the people you suggest should be based in Europe or have really strong ties to the continent in terms of personal and professional network. We also ask that your list is somewhat gender balanced. The people you recruit would be committing to do the following:
  * Come to three video calls (interview, discuss findings from SSNA, prepare event session)
  * Post their own story and respond to comments posted on it…
  * Read and leave thoughtful comments on stories of others ( contributions should be thoughtful &amp; rich: have to have value added for both participants and the team in terms of new information or perspectives to further the thinking/learning with quality).
  * ideally, they would also do one session in a final event, but this is not necessary.
6. Write six Internet of Humans Dispatch posts: Follow the conversation on the platform and highlight key contributions and insights emerging from it in a post. 
7. Participate in a remote meeting/ video call/virtual cafe: Discussion of findings from ethnographic-coding /SNNA analysis. *When:* TBD
8. Participate in a remote meeting/ video call/virtual cafe: To propose/develop one theme/track for the final IOH event weaving together key threads and a cluster of people/participants.
9. Co-write introduction to the event and detailed description your own event track in the Program for the final event. *When:* TBD
10. Participate in one physical event at the end of the fellowship to present your findings and hand over the reigns to the next batch of fellows.
11. Wrap up fellowship with one thoughtful post summarising fellowship experience, what you got out of it and your own recommendations for next batch of fellows to move the collective IOH experience &amp; community forward. *When:* TBD

**The bursary &amp; travel support:**

* We have a total of 6 fellowships to award at 10,000 EUR per fellow. Payment is done in tranches against submission of listed deliverables. 
* Each fellow is eligible for 400 Eur in travel support. Up to this amount in total is reimbursed to the fellow with due justification *prior to incurring the expense*, and is reimbursed after the travel has been conducted against receipts (with VAT) and documentation (written description of purpose of travel and what was learned/achieved as a result in a post on the platform).

_**The duration of the fellowship is 6 months.**_

## The Paperwork/administrative process we need you to follow:

**Step 1. We send you a Contract**

You are sent the draft your contract. You Read it through and if you agree, let the research coordinator @anon

**Step 2. Time tracking**

At the end of agreed period you need to report your time and describe the activities. To do this, we use the FreeAgent software. Ask us to create an account for you.

Go to “Work → Time Tracking”. You have now three options to proceed. In all cases, select the work package as the FreeAgent “Task” to which your worktime belongs. This is mandatory according to the reporting requirements we have.

* **Option 1** : Select project and task and click “Start Timer”. This will use FreeAgent as a time tracker. To stop tracking, click on the “pause” butanon3386180186 that appears next to your newly created timeslip.
* **Option 2** : Select project and task; fill in the worktime field and if necessary the date. Click “Add Timeslip” (the “Start Timer” butanon3386180186 changes its function when you add a worktime figure). This allows to record the worktime for a single day.
* **Option 3** : Click “Add Weekly Timesheet”. This allows to efficiently take over your worktime tracking from another tracking application, and may be your preferred choice if you are already using one.

Add a comment: a few words as to what you used the time for, referring to tasks and deliverables as much as possible. You can also add a link to what you produced, if applicable. For this, use the comment field at the bottom of the timeslip form.

Inform Marina that you finished reporting time for a certain period. She will export your timesheet.

**Step 3. Invoicing (you do this twice during your fellowship)**

Create your invoice. The time reported needs to correspond to the amount allocated for your work. Our standard hourly rate is 41,86 eur. To create the invoice you can use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uTZl6ZC-zJSDsQY9-sdmGkv762ECcI5HytktNk9cshE/edit).

Send your invoice to Marina. She will attach it to the exported timesheet, invite you to sign using SignRequest and import it back to FreeAgent to request the payment.

***Important to know about the IOH matchmaking and collaborative proposal writing/fundraising !!!***

*The people who participate have to do the actual work of putting together the proposals - we just save them time and money they would otherwise have to throw into the process of trying to participate in EC funding bids. The work has to start months ahead of time, with someone at their end committing to a structured process and taking responsibility for ensuring that their organisation respects everyone else’s time - by e.g submitting their parts in a shared document that is curated by someone who knows what they are doing*

*Our initial point of departure is EC funding applications for the next batch of Horizon2020 applications. That said, the process we have designed is intended to feed into other community submitted opportunities.

*People who have participated in previous Edgeryders run collective discovery and sensemaking processes have continued to build on the relationships formed. Some have gone on to do interesting work, others have received professional opportunities such as got invited into good consortia etc. The unMonastery, OpenCare. Others have continued to use the Edgeryders platform/instances of it for their own work e.g Winnie building a biohacking community connecting counterculture labs in SF (Openinsulin) with labs in Ghent, Geneva etc - at one point discussing with city of Milan about setting up a patient-owned microbrewery for insulin in the city.*"

I want to understand if there is more budget allocated to this kind of marketing. What are the main barriers inside teams to put in place the workflow that produces this kind of content. I have been doing a small research among law firms this year. this is the [research planning doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBf00LQecPoYDrnREwUMdDbHA4io8MQNtJVVAnRS78A/edit#)..i would be happy to continue this line of research and share the results. also bring with me a network of consultants that are doing advocacy to shift towards a more ethical web content marketing.

Basically, the Internet of Humans project can be relevant for you in a few different ways:

1. We will run collaborative proposal writing workshops, mainly to go for EU funds
2. We award fellowships with travel bursaries
3. We can direct you towards funds in the [NGI ecosystem](https://www.ngi.eu/)
4. We will run events like the one we just ran in Stockholm, connecting you to people who you could collaborate with to go for big funding from bodies like the EU Horizon 2020, which requires ambitious applications and multi-party consortia. 
5. We also work with policymakers and institutions who need to understand what you are building in order to create funding calls to match it.
6. We interface with policymakers and institutions to proactively influence better legislation to try to prevent legislators from breaking what we're working on

Your first step towards all of this is simple. Just make a post about yourself and what you are working on. We will then be able to tag you and draw you in when interesting things happen. Our next big collaborative proposal writing session will be in October."

What is wrong with Article 13 and what should a good copyright law look like?"

One is East Bay Ray, the guitarist for the punk band, The Dead Kennedys.  Another is a trio of angelic folk sanon2855557573rs, The Wailin' Jennys.

In both cases they have seen their revenue from recordings drop down to negligible numbers over the past 20 yrs.  This means they have to tour much more in order to be full time musicians.  Ray is 70 years old.  The Jennys all became mothers over the past decade.  Touring is much more of a hardship when you are a mother, and sometimes it just isn't doable. 

Will this new article 13 law help them and other copyright holders earn their living from their recordings?  Not unless it succeeds in forcing YouTube to stop allowing people to watch copyrighted material for free and they succeed in stopping stream-ripping sites from searching them for items to rip.  I do not see anon1138917760 they are going to accomplish that.  As of last fall, [YouTube had done nothing about it.](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/09/10/mpaa-piracy-stream-ripping/)

I am here at Edgeryders and the Human Internet project in particular as a community manager. I also build electromagnetic sculptures, collaborate with physicists to teleport art pieces in virtual galleries or do inclusive design research to lower entry barriers for information, services and educational applications.

I love to participate in and facilitate interdisciplinary communication and exchanges. Therefore I am excited about the type of community-driven research here at Edgeryders.

I have an inherent urge to find points of connections between topics and people thinking about those topics, which I call being a &ldquo;compulsive connector&rdquo;. I love to recommend books and texts as well as potential collaboration or conversation partners. If you want to discuss an idea or help to formulate headlines, concepts or questions to connect to other people to make your project grow I am very happy to help.

After my A-levels I started studying physics in Heidelberg, with the naive goal to understand everything, to than decide to change to fine art in Dresden to have more time to appreciate the beautiful models and think about their implications, from where, after participation in the FAST programme (Framing Art Science and Technology) I went to the RCA in London to do a Master in &ldquo;Information Experience Design&rdquo; to focus more on the design and development of &ldquo;Entry Points&rdquo; and &ldquo;points of Connection&rdquo; for others combining the approaches and tools of fine art, design, new technologies and scientific models.

I conceptualised, realised and exhibited multiple interactive sculptures and installations across Europe and worked as a UX design researcher for example with the Helen Hamlyn Centre for design or for the financial education startup &ldquo;Gimi&rdquo;. In 2018 I relocated to Stockholm and am now an artist in residence at the comunity and culture hub &ldquo;Blivande&rdquo;.

If you are interested you can find some of my artistic works on my website [mariaeuler.com](http://mariaeuler.com/).

Since 2010 I have lived in 6 different cities and 3 different countries in Europe and I very much appreciate being able to do that and the experiences and encounters I had and have while still being able to keep contact to my friends from school and later university across borders. However, sometimes I am questioning the effect of being disconnected from long term political and cultural discussions and participation due to this &ldquo;modern nomad&rdquo; lifestyle shared by so many of our generation, which is another reason I hope we can help to develop this more human-centric internet here at the Human Internet project. I believe strongly in international collaboration, exchange and friendships and hope we can help to create systems that lives up the reality of the transnational lifes we are leading.

I am looking forward to more communication,

Maria"

Hallo,

Ich bin Maria und bin hier auf Edgeryder als Community Manager. Sonst bin ich interdisziplinäre Künstlerin und mache Design Forschungsprojekte. 

Ich habe nach dem Abitur angefangen Physik in Heidelberg zu studieren, dann jedoch in Freie Kunst gewechselt um mehr Zeit und Freiraum zu haben für die Schönheit und Implikationen wissenschaftlicher Modelle. Schließlich habe ich meinen master in ""Information Experience Design"" am Royal College of Art in London gemacht. 

Ich konzeptualisiere und realisiere interactive Installationen die Kunst und Wissenschaft verbinde und stelle diese aus. Außerdem habe ich als Design Researcher mit dem Helen Hamlyn Center für Design und zum beispiel füf das Finanzielle Bildung startup ""Gimi"" gearbeitet. 

Ich habe in den letzten 10 Jahren in 6 Stödten in 3 Ländern gelebt und es ist sehr wichtig für mich nicht nur Kontakt zu den menschen zu halten die ich dort treffe, sonder auch nicht den Anschluss and politische und kulturelle Diskussionen zu verlieren. Ich hoffe wir könne hier daran arbeiten Systeme zu entwickeln die modernen Lebenswirklichkeiten und menschlichen Werten entsprechen.

Derzeit lebe ich in Stockholm.

I verbinde gerne Themen und Menschen und helfe Konzepte, Fragen und Überschriften zu formulieren um andere zu erreichen damit Projekte wachsen können.

ich freue mich mit euch zu kommunizieren und zu forschen,

Maria"

For a bit of a fresh perspective, it just occurred to me that both of these problems are not problems with just the current Internet but with pretty much everything in Western (and Westernized) societies. _Everything_ is unhealthy and has been used as an instrument of control in the interest of corporate profits and state profits (i.e. tax revenue via GDP growth). Examples include:

* the industrialized food system, which includes massive advertising for unhealthy eatable stuff, heavily processed an addictive food, industrially grown ""organic"" products, commercialized ""fair trade"" products with hollow promises and branded basic food items (which did not exist until the 1920s / 1930s)

* the waste management system, with contracts setting the incentives against political measures for trash reduction, as the promise a certain amount of (profitable) trash to the collection companies … which then use the plastic for example like free fuel and just burn it in power stations to profit from the electricity (I know this in detail from a certain medium-sized city over here …)

* delusional advertising on for-profit TV stations … while this was a point of discourse in the late 90s here in Germany, now everyone has just become used to it

* the housing market, which has in many places morphed from a market to fulfill the basic need of accommodation to a market to fulfill the desire of investors and landlords for ROI / profits

* … and there is of course more, you name it

That's just to illustrate: the Internet is going the only way that has been prepared for it by an industrial, oligopolist, capital-intensive, consumption-driven economic system.

A publisher makes editorial choices and takes responsibility for the consequences of that content.  It used to be a pretty clear distinction until online conversation networks came along.

In the early days, those of us who managed those online conversation networks, including big companies like America Online, argued that we shouldn't be held liable for everything that the users say to each other, because for one thing, we would have to pre-approve everything that got posted, which most users would find intolerable.  Or we would have to actively censor whatever we found objectionable.  So for the most part people said whatever they wanted and dealt with the liability or libel issues themselves.  In 1996 in the USA, Congress passed the Communications Decency Act that did a number of things, mainly related to obscenity and minors, but included section 230 which make online services immune from liability for the content posted on those companies' sites.  In 1997 the Supreme Court struck down most of the CDA, but kept Section 230.  This was all before social media as we know it was even dreamed up.

So into this legal framework came social media operations that gained audience far beyond anything any other online service had ever seen or even likely dreamed of.  And with the advent of the Facebook 'news feed' began the process we find ourselves in today where the companies actively manipulate what we see on our screens to maximize our desire to stay on the site, or return to it often, and to feed us a lot of what we want to see and hear so we might buy the things the advertisers sanon1138917760 to us.  Whether they intended it or not, this actively contributes to a more polarized society according to numerous studies and essays.  

And now, Facebook has banned extremist individuals outright.

So are they a platform or a publisher?  They say they are a platform when they want that shielding from the law and they admit to being a publisher when they want to get rid of what they consider to be hate speech or people who espouse violence.

But when the New Zealand mass shooter spread that video all around Facebook, Facebook used the shield of a platform to avoid liability for spreading it, but then they wanted to be a publisher when they banned it.  And let us remember that while that video was viewed on their platform millions of times, they made money off the ads that ran along with it."

For now FB can play the neutral platform card.

So are they a platform or a publisher?
[/quote]

The debate on Internet regulation teems with these questions. Is Uber a tech company or a taxi company? Is Airbnb a platform or a hotel business? I am fresh from a long conversation with Amelia Andersdotter (@anon3099529057). She explained that the legal consequences of sticking a label on things are very far-reaching. If I understand her reasoning, she advocates: 

1. Taking a long, hard look at the emergent consequences of the way these companies do business before taking action. 
1. Mapping these consequences against the values that we would like society to uphold. This can be messy. In the case of Uber, some people dislike the relatively low compensation that many drivers appear to get for their time. But some others point to the fact that Uber has made taxi travel safe for Indian women. Women do not like to take taxis in India, because drivers have been known to demand more money than agreed once the car is in motion and the client has left the safety of her house. There have been cases of harassment, too. Uber does not have these problems, because (1) the price or a ride is established and (2) the identity of the driver is known, and the company is credible when it threatens consequences against misbehaving drivers.
1. Only after this move in to regulate. 

I am probably representing this anon2298377336 clumsily, Amelia herself could do it much better."

In Uber's case, it does seem like the taxi cab industry, at least in the US, was so complacent that it was ripe for serious disruption.  With AirBnB it's more complicated because an unintended consequence is anon1138917760 much it has changed the rental picture for local residents, which has large social impact.  In Facebook's case, they seem to just want to run out ahead of any regulation, because, I think, they want to constantly adjust their models to maximize their ROI from all the data gathering.

I can sympathize with FB's view in a sense.  Back when I started and managed sfgate.com, it was owned by a company that had thousands of employees, both union and non-union.  The unionized workers were represented by no less than 14 separate unions.  Naturally they wanted to represent my employees too.  I, as a lifelong union sympathizer and former union member myself (Machinists International), thought that someday it would be appropriate for them to represent the workers on my crew.  But not at first because they would enforce rules written long ago for a different industry with clear divisions of labor and that would stifle the quick movements we required to be innovative.  And in that sense, unions function kind of like regulators.  But then, we were essentially giving news away to the public with a small number of ads thrown in and we were not doing any deep data mining on our users.."

> the Commission feels a mismatch between who they are talking and the pioneers of this new human-centric Internet.

As I considered this, I realized that it is not at all clear (not to me, at least) what ""a human-centric Internet"" actually is. @anon3614937280 (at the London meeting) and @anon2821203031 (in [this article](https://www.britishcouncil.org/anyone-anywhere/explore/web-for-all/rethinking-internet)) have spelled out the NGI Forward vision as well as I know anon1138917760: 

> But things don’t have to be this way. Between Silicon Valley’s corporate-led internet and the Chinese model, where the government is in charge, can we come up with a third narrative, where citizens and communities are in control and can determine their own future?

In other words, **for now all we have a is a big question mark**. This opens a lot of room for ""mismatches"" like the one described by Mirko. Who is it the Commission have in mind? Who could be a good metaphor for a human-centric Internet builder? A Creative Commons lawyer? A Siemens R&D employee? A startupper drawing exponential curves in a PowerPoint file?

As I mused about these things I chanced into a discussion on [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/),  (like @anon280016435 and @anon2205132963, I try to keep some tendrils in the indieweb, probably not as seriously as they do). To see the whole thing, if you use Scuttlebutt, use message ID `%u0fnmwUQTBcL9S8HP3uYCdBgnssu4GIyWSuo5XLYvPs=.sha256`, but the title says it all: ""Deprioritizing first world problems"". The back story is this: an often-repeated feature request of Scuttlebutt is to provide for a multi-device account. The author of the original post has this to offer:

> Multi-device management is by definition a problem experienced by people who  *own multiple devices* , and those are probably by definition not the underconnected world [...]. 

>It turns out that if you pick first world techies as your target audience, you'll be dealing with people who perceive tiny inconveniences to be major sanon1138917760stoppers. Moreover, if you keep on catering to them, you'll be empowering privileged people more than the underprivileged (one example is that if you build apps to be online-only, you are privileging the privileged with good internet connectivity and ignoring the underprivileged, widening the inequality gap further). Meanwhile, underprivileged people are less demanding and more welcoming to almost any progress. In other words, it takes 100h of work to make a privileged audience satisfied, while it takes 10h to make an underprivileged audience satisfied, because of low-hanging fruits and less demanding attitude from users. And the underprivileged are often excluded from target audiences because they aren't economically viable customers. But that's when you're running a business, and with Manyverse I'm not. It takes a tech giant or a VC-funded startup to build polished apps for first world techies, while it takes just a reasonable amount of free time from open sourcerers to build decent proof-of-concept software for less demanding audiences.

This gave me a bit of an ""aha"" moment. The builders of Scuttlebutt **started from the sort of human community they wanted to build**: open to the underprivileged, solving basic social connectivity problems while staying away from surveillance capitalism, etc., *and on those basis they are making all their technical choices*, right down to the editor. As they do that, they discover and exploit sources of economic efficiency (""underprivileged audiences are less demanding, easier to serve with open source tech""). They ended up with a very different product from the ones they are seeking to replace, and with a *very* different community. Diaspora still feels Facebook-ish: Scuttlebutt feels completely different, to me at least. See the video below if you want a quick intro.

So. Human-centric, check. Technical innovation, check. Social innovation, check. Are communities like these those we are supposed to engage in NGI Forward? If so, I am afraid the narrative will have to change in depth to make space for that much diversity in the conversation.. Those guys might engage, but they will come asking some deep, probably unsettling questions. ""If the purpose is serving humans, it is not a given that we should be even giving business a say. By your own definition, business is only relevant if it serves humans"", and so on.

Absolutely, I think you’re spot on. Communities using and building things like Scuttlebutt (also known as SSB), DAT, IPFS, Beaker and Mastodon are a great starting point for exactly these reasons. These are the first groups I want to engage with. We have a huge reservoir of themes to draw upon that these communities are already discussing: resilience, environment, alternative energy, wellbeing, social issues, decentralized institutions for solidarity and many more. Through our good friends at Enspiral, we have direct access to the heart of the Scuttlebutt community as the main developer [Dominic Tarr](https://twitter.com/dominictarr) is from New Zealand, so it's a good place to start. 

Someone made this map of anon1138917760 the user-base and culture of various social online technologies map on to the political compass. I don't know who the author is, and it is obviously to be taken with a pinch of salt, but there is some truth to it. It corresponds broadly to my own experience with these communities.

![authoritarian-kwangmyong-stormfront-cubadebate-gab-ai-wechat-baidu-vkontakt-authoritarian-left-29889578|500x591](upload://rUQhhzsRidJ5AhQ1eADvZYEzjkm.png) 

Engaging the communities on the two libertarian quadrants to engage in the NGI conversation is crucial. To do so, we will need to give them incentives. Access to funding through calls, and some guidance for anon1138917760 to apply, is one incentive. Creating high-profile invite-only events that cater to their tastes is another. That said, there are smoother ways that invite-only to get to the right people, which is essentially to make the communication specific enough in flavour that only the right people understand why they should go. One event using this strategy is [Data Terra Nemo](https://dtn.is/), which I will be attending in May.

As a side-note, Scuttlebutt developer Dominic Tarr has anon2298377336 the story to tell. He is an extremely productive author of open source libraries, and has written hundreds of modules that are being used all around the internet. He has never been paid a dime for this work, and gives the code away. Obviously, he can't maintain all this code, so when people come along to take over maintaining old modules he is has written ages ago, he is happy to hand over the reins. This created controversy as it was discovered that control over one of those modules had ended up in the hands of a thug who inserted malicious  code into an update, which was then pushed out to thousands of servers all around the internet. Its intended target was a single Bitcoin wallet platform called Copay which was using the module, and the perpetrator could then harvest account details of any account with more than 100 Bitcoin. Dominic caught a lot of flack for not doing due diligence on who he hands over code to, but [his response](https://gist.github.com/dominictarr/9fd9c1024c94592bc7268d36b8d83b3a) was that as long as companies are not paying maintainers of the modules they use or maintaining the modules themselves, they had themselves to blame."

You are right, this is anon2298377336 the story! Its morals are clear: if you go with the present economic model for the Internet, ""human-centric"" will remain an aspiration, rather than a description. The Internet's economy post-1993 pulls in the opposite direction.

My internet career goes all the way back to 1986 when I started as the Marketing Director for [The WELL](https://www.well.com/), described by Wired! Magazine in 1997 as ""The world's most influential online community.""  There was no name for it back then because nobody had yet done it as a job, but I was in realty the first ""online community manager.""

In 1994 I co-founded and managed the first major online news website, [SF Gate](https://www.sfgate.com/).  We were the first to do a number of things on the web that are now standard.  And we were the first to live webcast a major sporting event in 1997.

Later I was Director of Development for the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/), and still later the General Manager of a [public FM radio station](https://www.kzyx.org/#stream/0) in California, where I live.

I've been part of Edgeryders since 2016.

I have seen first hand the entire arc of the internet with all that is both wonderful and terrible about it.  It disturbs me that it increasingly concentrates power and wealth in the hands of a few gigantic companies.  This winner-take-all situation is not what we pictured as we were building the various parts of the Internet.  I hope that here we will bring out new ideas and paths forward to put the 'Net back to the human-centered place we knew that it could, and should, be.

I live on the north coast of California, in a meadow by the redwoods about 3 km from the pacific ocean cliffs."

The link above leads to a review written by a site called One Angry Gamer, a news website that covers gaming, but also internet freedom and ""ethics in journalism"". The money quote (emphasis mine):

> A European Union-funded initiative called Eunomia has contracted various thinktanks, tech groups, and Fediverse evangelists to help with a new social credit scoring system. The system will be applied to social media and the federated destinations using blockchain technology. It will be governed by a crowdsourced system where groups rank up and rank down the trust levels of information. **In simple terms, it’s an adaptation of China’s social credit scoring system for the Fediverse**. Well, someone working on the project leaked some chat logs, and it reveals a rather antagonistic nature from the people working on the project toward the users who are skeptical of this EU funded project. [..] This obviously didn’t seem like an innocuous project from the EU especially given the Union’s recent anti-freedom of speech initiatives like [Article 11 and Article 13](https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2019/03/article-11-and-article-13-have-passed-public-list-made-available-of-politicians-who-voted-for-bills/80963/). [...] **Why is a social scoring system even needed for social media if users didn’t ask for it?**

Note the reference to the Fediverse. One of the partners is Eugen “Gargron” Rochko, the creator of Mastodon. It seems reasonable to deduce that there is anon2298377336 some trust to rebuild, and that suggests a lot of listening in NGI, and not so much speaking.

And a question to @anon2516847305. Where does this type of post go in the public space? It was not obvious to me, given the cats you made."

See if they make sense to you.  I'm trying to find a small number of larger 'buckets"" that will work with tags to help people get to the things that interest them. Looking for balance between good organization and screen clutter. I'd make those boxes smaller but I don't see where to do that.

So, then, in the case of this 'we did not ask for it' topic, I would put in under Governance since it is talking about a EU-directed potential regulation."

As for ""making sense"", I dislike ontologies and see them as a necessary evil, and [they are overrated anyway](http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html). From a community management point of view, I also dislike empty or semi-empty cats. So, my instinct would be to have only ONE cat, #ioh, with one subcat for the research team, and maybe (maybe) differentiate later, when the discussion is so crowded that it begs breaking down. That's anon1138917760 OpenCare worked, and that's anon1138917760 I would do it if I were in your shoes."

Was trying them out for size in anticipation that more organization will be called for later.  Pre-release mocking up.  Ontologies and tags and all are not as important as they once were when search was more cumbersome than it is today.  But I think they are more useful than you do probably.  At any rate they help describe the landscape.  

Anyway I moved this into a general discussion area.  Probably will come up with a snappier name for it.."

My name is Mattias Axell and I am a returning community user at the Edgeryders community platform from earlier interest and endeavors some years ago.

Since my earlier interest in Edgeryders I have studied the entrepreneurial programme at Kaospilot in Denmark. During my studies there I started engaging in government transparency connected to freedom of information and open data. I have previously worked as a producer in 3D industry, with events such as hackathons, hosted and moderated conference tracks, helped out with workshops, held courses, lectures and seminars at different conferences and events regarding widely ranging topics.

I am introducing myself here as part of my new part-time project to collaborate with @anon280016435 and arrange an event for the NGI project during 11th of May 2019. I currently also work part-time with [Civic Tech Sweden](https://civictech.se/) where I am trying to gather a community and network in Sweden for free software and open source initiatives but also in general tech initiatives which tries to create more and different kinds of value for society. 

I will be working with @anon"
